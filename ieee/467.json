This methodology consists of three steps: The first two steps refer to creating a database for training using a set of documents, while the third one refers to recognition of new document images. First, a pre-processing step that includes image binarization and enhancement takes place. At a second step a top-down segmentation approach is used in order to detect text lines, words and characters. A clustering scheme is then adopted in order to group characters of similar shape. This is a semi-automatic procedure since the user is able to interact at any time in order to correct possible errors of clustering and assign an ASCII label. After this step, a database is created in order to be used for recognition. Finally, in the third step, for every new document image the above segmentation approach takes place while the recognition is based on the character database that has been produced at the previous step.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Eighth IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis

The efficacy of our end-to-end OCR system is demonstrated by rapidly configuring our OCR engine for the Thai script.

This paper unifies a wide range of density smoothing techniques called global smoothing and presents a highly efficient method for computing the gradient of such smoothed densities used in several well-known analytical placers. This method reduces the complexity of the gradient computation by a factor of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n compared with a naive method, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n is the number of modules. Furthermore, with this efficient gradient computation, it is able to support an efficient nonlinear programming-based placement framework, which supersedes the existing force-directed placement methods. Experiments show that replacing the approximated gradient computation in mPL6 with the exact gradient computation improves wire length by 15% on the IBM-HB+ benchmark and by 3% on average on the modified International Symposium on Physical Design 2005 (ISPD'05) and ISPD'06 placement contest benchmarks with movable macros. The results also show that the augmented Lagrangian method outperforms the quadratic penalty method with the exact gradient computation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006158","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4670057/04670063.pdf","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient Gradient Computation for Density-Constrained Analytical Placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient Gradient Computation for Density-Constrained Analytical Placement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313282","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670063/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient Gradient Computation for Density-Constrained Analytical Placement","sourcePdf":"tcad-luo-2006158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141759S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4670057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4670057","articleId":"4670063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4670064,"authors":[{"name":"Hosung Kim","affiliation":["Tabula, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4670057/4670064/4670064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hosung (Leo) Kim received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Illinois, Chicago, in 2008.","He was with LG Electronics as a Personal Digital Assistant and cellular phone Product Planner.

In this paper, we present EBOARST, an efficient four-step algorithm to construct a rectilinear obstacle-avoiding Steiner tree for a given set of pins and a given set of rectilinear obstacles. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we propose a novel algorithm, which generates sparse obstacle-avoiding spanning graphs efficiently. Second, we present a fast algorithm for the minimum terminal spanning tree construction step, which dominates the running time of several existing approaches. Third, we present an edge-based heuristic, which enables us to perform both local and global refinements, leading to Steiner trees with small lengths. Finally, we discuss a refinement technique called segment translation to further enhance the quality of the trees. The time complexity of our algorithm is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\nlog\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n).

Such iterations are often due to the difficulty of early delay estimation, particularly before placement. Therefore, effective logic restructuring to reduce interconnect delay has been a major challenge in physical synthesis, a phase during which more accurate delay estimates can be finally gathered. In this paper, we develop a new approach that enhances modern high-performance logic synthesis techniques with flexibility and accuracy in the physical domain. This approach is based on the following: 1) a novel criterion based on path monotonicity, which identifies those interconnects that are amenable to optimization through logic restructuring, and 2) a synthesis algorithm relying on logic simulation and placement information to identify placed subcircuits that hold promise for interconnect reduction. Experiments indicate that our techniques find optimization opportunities and improve interconnect delay by 11.7% on average at less than 2% wirelength and area overhead.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006156","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4670057/04670071.pdf","startPage":"2107","endPage":"2119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Nonmonotonic Interconnect Using Functional Simulation and Logic Restructuring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Nonmonotonic Interconnect Using Functional Simulation and Logic Restructuring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313289","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670071/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Nonmonotonic Interconnect Using Functional Simulation and Logic Restructuring","sourcePdf":"tcad-plaza-2006156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120989S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4670057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4670057","articleId":"4670071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4670072,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["SpringSoft, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4670057/4670072/4670072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tung-Chieh Chen (S'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","He was a visiting Ph.D. student with the University of Texas, Austin, in 2007.

To efficiently estimate metal density and thickness, we first apply a probabilistic routing model and then a predictive CMP model to obtain the metal-density map. Based on the metal-density map, we use an analytical placement framework to spread blocks to reduce metal-density variation. Experimental results based on BoxRouter and NTUgr show that our method can effectively reduce the CMP variation. By using our MDD placement, for example, the topography variation can be reduced by up to 38% (23%) and the number of dummy fills can be reduced by up to 14% (8%), compared with those using wirelength-driven (cell-density-driven) placement. The results of our MDD placement can also lead to better routability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006148","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2006148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4670057/04670072.pdf","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metal-Density-Driven Placement for CMP Variation and Routability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Metal-Density-Driven Placement for CMP Variation and Routability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313290","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670072/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metal-Density-Driven Placement for CMP Variation and Routability","sourcePdf":"tcad-chen-2006148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093081S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4670057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4670057","articleId":"4670072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4670074,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Massier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology,Institute for Electronic Design Automation, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4670057/4670074/4670074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Massier received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany, in 2002, where he has been working toward the Dr. Ing. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Electronic Design Automation, since 2002.","His research interests include computer-aided design of analog integrated circuits and systems, particularly structural analysis and sizing of analog circuits."]},"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Massier","id":"37660388300"},{"name":"Helmut Graeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology,Institute for Electronic Design Automation, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4670057/4670074/4670074-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Helmut Graeb (M'02\u2013SM'03) received the Dipl.Ing. and Dr. Ing. degrees from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), Munich, Germany, in 1986 and 1993, respectively.","From 1986 to 1987, he was with Siemens Corporation, Munich, where he was involved in the design of DRAMs. Since 1987, he has been with the Institute of Electronic Design Automation, TUM, where he has been the Head of a research group since 1992.

MashupAdvisor aims to assist mashup creators to build higher quality mashups in less time. Based on the current state of a mashup, the MashupAdvisor quietly suggests outputs (goals) that the user might want to include in the final mashup. MashupAdvisor exploits a repository of mashups to estimate the popularity of specific outputs, and makes suggestions using the conditional probability that an output will be included, given the current state of the mashup. When a suggestion is accepted, MashupAdvisor uses a semantic matching algorithm and a metric planner to modify the mashup to produce the suggested output. Our prototype was implemented on top of IBM Lotus MashupMaker and our initial results show that it is effective.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670129/4670130/04670193.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2008.128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mashup Advisor: A Recommendation Tool for Mashup Development","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mashup Advisor: A Recommendation Tool for Mashup Development","htmlLink":"/document/4670193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10394114","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mashup Advisor: A Recommendation Tool for Mashup Development","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3310a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046466S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670129","isNumber":"4670130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670129","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4670130","articleId":"4670193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4670194,"authors":[{"name":"Arif Bramantoro","affiliation":["Department of Social Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Bramantoro","id":"37671332100"},{"name":"Masahiro Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Social Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37537217400"},{"name":"Yohei Murakami","affiliation":["Language Grid Project, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37534704600"},{"name":"Ulrich Sch\u00e4fer","affiliation":["Language Technology Laboratory, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Sch\u00e4fer","id":"37591245100"},{"name":"Toru Ishida","affiliation":["Language Grid Project, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Japan","Department of Social Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37274083500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3310-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4670194","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Web services","Heart","Gold","Natural language processing","XML","Robustness","Service oriented architecture","Informatics","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","natural language processing","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid integrated architecture","language service composition","natural language processing components","Web services","interoperability","distributed language services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["language resources","Natural Language Processing","Web services"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2008.79","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670129/4670130/04670194.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.79","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Integrated Architecture for Language Service Composition","abstract":"This paper reports on our experiences with combining Heart of Gold and Language Grid technology to provide more language resources available on Web.

To that end, many service providers have adopted the shared service model where the service offerings are shared across multiple customers to reduce the costs associated with the services' delivery. One key challenge for service providers is how to configure various parameters and options of the services with highly automated and self-service modes to meet the customers' diverse requirements with minimized costs. Therefore, effective service configuration lifecycle management technologies and approaches have become the differentiations of successful service providers. In this paper, we propose a common service configuration framework as one of the infrastructure features of the service operation platform based on the shared service model to ease and unify the configuration lifecycle across service offerings. In this framework, we adopt the model-driven technology to automate the service configuration lifecycle. This novel approach combines the wizard technology and rule-based validation technology to enable the service customers to perform self-service configuration. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework is discussed at the end of this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670213/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394134","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Framework for Enabling Self-Service Configuration of Business Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Framework for Enabling Self-Service Configuration of Business Services","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3310a497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079374S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670129","isNumber":"4670130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670129","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4670130","articleId":"4670213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4670228,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Dwivedi","affiliation":["SETLaboratories, Infosys Technologies Limited, India"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Dwivedi","id":"37661326500"},{"name":"Naveen Kulkarni","affiliation":["SETLaboratories, Infosys Technologies Limited, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37546923100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3310-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4670228","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Information analysis","Service oriented architecture","Web services","Data acquisition","Feeds","Globalization","Data mining","XML","Technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analytics","SOA realization","business information provider firm","data acquisition","quality check","reporting","ETL based workflows","shared services","business processes","Web-services","service oriented architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ETL","Workflow","SOA Adoption","Extract Tranform Load"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present a case study of a SOA realization exercise at a business information provider firm, which deals with disparate sources of data in-order to provide reliable reports to its clients.

This paper also addresses how shared services, business processes, rules, and semantics are used to provide quality and agility to the internal processes many of which are entirely dependent on the type of data received. The case and the scenario are chosen specifically to emphasize the fact, that mere web-services implementation does not lead to service oriented architecture, but it is the appropriate usage of them.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2008.119","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4670129/4670130/04670228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670130","startPage":"615","endPage":"620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information as a Service in a Data Analytics Scenario - A Case Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information as a Service in a Data Analytics Scenario - A Case Study","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670228/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394149","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information as a Service in a Data Analytics Scenario - A Case Study","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3310a615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041935S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4670129","isNumber":"4670130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4670129","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4670130","articleId":"4670228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4670339,"authors":[{"name":"Attaphongse Taparugssanagorn","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4702725/4670339/4670339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Attaphongse Taparugssanagorn was born in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1975.

The TDM-based switching enables very cost-effective solutions. Nevertheless, it can cause measurement errors due to phase noise in the local oscillators. In typical MIMO applications with a relatively small number of TX and RX antennas, the measurement cycle for a single snapshot of a MIMO radio channel is so short that independent or white Gaussian noise samples cannot be assumed. Indeed, the characteristics of the phase noise depend on the observing-time scale and the local oscillator design in the TX and the RX. In free-running systems, in which the local oscillators of the TX and the RX employ their own clocks, the properties of the phase noise have a strong dependence on the scale of the observing time. In particular, the short-term characteristics of the phase noise have not been considered in literature regarding MIMO measurements. In this paper, the characteristics of the short-term phase noise in time-switched MIMO radio channel measurements are disclosed. We show also that the Allan deviation, which commonly characterizes the frequency stability of the local oscillators, does not apply well to the short-term scale. Instead, an autoregressive model that is well suited for modeling of correlated noise is applied to characterize the short-term behavior of the phase noise. Finally, the effect of short-term phase noise on the estimation of MIMO channel capacity is analyzed. We also derive an upper bound for the ergodic channel capacity and show that it is dependent on the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of the noise covariance matrix. The results reveal that the effect of short-term phase noise always overestimates MIMO channel capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of Short-Term Phase Noise of MIMO Channel Sounding and Its Effect on Capacity Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.911647","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4702725/04670339.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.911647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4702725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Short-Term Phase Noise of MIMO Channel Sounding and Its Effect on Capacity Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4670339/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10359835","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Short-Term Phase Noise of MIMO Channel Sounding and Its Effect on Capacity Estimation","sourcePdf":"58tim01-taparugssanagorn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044408S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4702725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4702725","articleId":"4670339","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4670415,"authors":[{"name":"Mario A.

In this paper we study the applicability of a special model of radial basis probabilistic neural networks (RBPNN) as a classifier for speech recognition. This type of network is a combination of radial basis function (RBF) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) that applies characteristics of both networks and finally uses a competitive function for computing final result. The proposed network has been tested on the voices of single digit numbers dataset and produced lower recognition error rate in comparison with other common pattern classifiers. All of classifiers use Mel-scale frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and a special type of perceptual linear predictive (PLP) as their features for classification.

An advanced measurement setup comprised of a large-signal network analyzer is used to characterize the adverse effects of EMI on the device characteristics of an RF power amplifier and the performance of digital modulation schemes. Furthermore, our analysis incorporated hybrid numerical tools, such as the hybrid S-parameter method to carry out an extensive EMI analysis of digital modulation schemes in the presence of complex structures, such as cylindrical cavities. Our studies yield critical information for the communication systems. For instance, our analysis suggests that digital modulation schemes are more susceptible to EMI than the RF power amplifier that processes the modulated signals. Power levels of the order of megawatts are required to have a notable impact on the device characteristics of an RF amplifier in the presence of a missile-like body, whereas, much lower power levels are sufficient to degrade the performance of a digital modulation scheme as long as it is within the bandwidth of the modulated signal. Our analysis further indicates that nonconstant envelope digital modulation schemes are more susceptible to EMI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital modulation","Modulation","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","modulation","network analysers","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power electromagnetic interference","high-power EMI","RF power amplifier","digital modulation","next generation communication systems","large-signal network analyzer","hybrid S-parameter","modulated signals","missile-like body"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital modulation","electromagnetic interference (EMI)","intentional EMI","power amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.2004600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4669925/04670487.pdf","startPage":"849","endPage":"860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.2004600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Power EMI on RF Amplifier and Digital Modulation Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Power EMI on RF Amplifier and Digital Modulation Schemes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670487/","volume":"50","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670487/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10313190","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Power EMI on RF Amplifier and Digital Modulation Schemes","sourcePdf":"temc-bayram-2004600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060586S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4669925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4669925","articleId":"4670487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4670489,"authors":[{"name":"Harish Bhaskar","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Harish","lastName":"Bhaskar","id":"37394999400"},{"name":"Lyudmila Mihaylova","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Lyudmila","lastName":"Mihaylova","id":"37284641500"},{"name":"Simon Maskell","affiliation":["Malvern Technology Centre, QinetiQ Limited"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Maskell","id":"37268735800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1739-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1740-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-1672"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-1294"}],"articleNumber":"4670489","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Genetic algorithms","Biological system modeling","Object detection","Layout","Pixel","Intelligent systems","Intelligent structures","Computer vision","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","image matching","image motion analysis","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human body parts tracking","pictorial structures","genetic algorithm","computer vision problem","automatic detection","background subtraction","foreground modeling","matching technique","self-adaptive cluster level BS scheme","Gaussian mixture model","appearance learning model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["articulated object tracking","human body parts tracking","background subtraction","clustering","GMM","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IS.2008.4670489","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662488/4670488/04670489.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International IEEE Conference Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International IEEE Conference Intelligent Systems","startPage":"10-2","endPage":"10-6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2008.4670489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human body parts tracking using pictorial structures and a genetic algorithm","abstract":"Tracking people and localising body parts is a challenging computer vision problem because people move unpredictably under circumstances of partial and full occlusions.

The developed architecture combines a self-adaptive cluster level BS scheme using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an appearance learning model of the foreground with pictorial structures.

As shown in [1], the error floor of LDPC Code is decreased by using PEG algorithm, but the error correction performance in waterfall region is compromised since a stopping set with small size will form the codeword with small Hamming weight over AWGN [2]. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to construct LDPC Codes. In our algorithm, we construct LDPC Code to avoid small girth and small stopping set by detecting the complete associated matrix of check node (defined in this paper) that converted from bipartite graph of LDPC Code based on the graph theory. Simulation shows that the LDPC code constructed by our algorithm has lower error floor than randomly constructed LDPC Code.

A practical example is employed to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has merits of straightforward concept; easy implementation; better effectiveness than previous methods; better effectiveness and efficiency than the GA with MU (GA-MU); automatic adjustment of the randomly assigned penalty to an appropriate value, and the requirement for only a small population in applications of real life PELD operations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670767","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670767.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"352","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm for power load dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for power load dispatch","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10390129","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670767/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for power load dispatch","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092333S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4670769,"authors":[{"name":"Lian Ming Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Electronic Technology, Northeast Normal University, ChangChun, China"],"lastName":"Lian Ming Wang","id":"37087179228"},{"name":"Yu Fen Deng","affiliation":["Institute of Hydrographic Surveying and Charting, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yu Fen Deng","id":"37087176994"},{"name":"Xian Long Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Hydrographic Surveying and Charting, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Xian Long Zhao","id":"37087176801"},{"name":"Bao Liang Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Hydrographic Surveying and Charting, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Bao Liang Liu","id":"37087177582"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670769","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670769","abstract":"most sensors can not be modeled easily, which leads to the problem that a circuit with sensors can not be simulated in PSPICE. A method based on the neural network for modeling NTC thermistors and creating a NTC thermistor model library for PSPICE is presented to solve the problem. Firstly, a multi-layer feedforward neural network is used to approximate the characteristics of a NTC thermistor. Secondly, the achieved structure of the neural network is described in the PSPICE language to form a subcircuit. Thirdly, the structure is used to model the same series of NTC thermistors by changing weights and biases of the neural network. Finally, the subcircuits for the series of NTC thermistors can be packed into a file to create a model library. During PSPICE simulation, the variations of a non-electric quantity imposed on a sensor are replaced with those of an electric quantity. The availability of this method is verified in circuit simulation. This method can be extended to model other sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670769","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1137","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670769.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for creating a NTC thermistor model library for PSPICE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Thermistors","Libraries","SPICE","Circuit simulation","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Thermal sensors","Multi-layer neural network","Temperature sensors","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","multilayer perceptrons","SPICE","thermistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NTC thermistor model library","PSPICE","multilayer feedforward neural network","circuit simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model library","Neural network","PSPICE","NTC thermistor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for creating a NTC thermistor model library for PSPICE","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393607","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for creating a NTC thermistor model library for PSPICE","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05723S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4670784,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Chu Cheng","affiliation":["College of Power and Mechanical engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yuan-Chu Cheng","id":"37087358882"},{"name":"Wei-Min Qi","affiliation":["College of Power and Mechanical engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wei-Min Qi","id":"37087738954"},{"name":"Jie Zhao","affiliation":["College of Power and Mechanical engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jie Zhao","id":"37087072212"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670784","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Feedforward systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mathematical model","System identification","Mechanical factors","Educational institutions","Mechanical engineering","Output feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","nonlinear dynamical systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Elman neural network","dynamic recurrent neural network","proportional-integral-derivative property","mathematical model","nonlinear dynamic system identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic recurrent network","Elman neural network","PID properties","dynamic system identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670784","abstract":"Elman neural network was one of the dynamic recurrent neural networks.

The traditional fuzzy clustering method (FCM) is good at local searching capability, but it is sensitive to the initial value and easy to trap into local minimum value. The small-world algorithm (SWA), inspired by the mechanism of small-world phenomenon, is a novel global searching algorithm, which enables to enhance the diversity of the population and avoid trapping into local minimum value. However, the further capability of solving complicated problems is limited for its low efficiency of local short-range searching operator. In this paper, the chaos disturbance is utilized to improve the searching efficiency of SWA after local short-range search, and the chaos small-world algorithm (CSWA) is used to optimize the FCM in image edge detection. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can correctly detect the fuzzy and exiguous edges with higher convergence speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670788.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fuzzy clustering method based on chaos small-world algorithm for image edge detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering methods","Chaos","Clustering algorithms","Image edge detection","Optimization methods","Image processing","Convergence","Fuzzy sets","Mechanical engineering","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","edge detection","image recognition","pattern clustering","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy clustering method","chaos small-world algorithm","image edge detection","fuzzy edge detection","global searching algorithm","local short-range searching operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy clustering algorithm","chaos optimization","small-world algorithm","edge detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel fuzzy clustering method based on chaos small-world algorithm for image edge detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670788/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393622","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fuzzy clustering method based on chaos small-world algorithm for image edge detection","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073676S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4670791,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Guo Wang","affiliation":["Department of ET, and Department of ECE, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng-Guo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280453400"},{"name":"Ben Wang","affiliation":["IBM, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280509300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670791","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reduced order systems","Integrated circuit interconnections","Approximation error","Frequency domain analysis","RLC circuits","Upper bound","State-space methods","Computer networks","Distributed parameter circuits","Delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency-domain analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","RLC circuits","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balanced truncation method","time domain performance","distributed RLC interconnect model reduction","model reduction methods","frequency domain","high order system","low order system","computation complexity","complex systems","transmission lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["complex system","balanced truncation method","example","time domain performance","model reduction error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670791","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670791.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An example of balanced truncation method and its surprising time domain performance","abstract":"This paper presents an example of using the balanced truncation method (BTM) for a distributed RLC interconnect model reduction. The example shows a surprising result and some possible hidden phenomenon in model reduction methods. We find that a high order BTM model has much worse performance than a low order BTM model, in view of the original model and their step responses in the time domain. This unexpected finding contradicts to our common expectation from the well-known approximation error upper bound results of the BTM in frequency domain. It reveals a fact that though the high order system keeps more states than the low order system, the approximation error behavior in the time domain may be totally different from its counterpart in the frequency domain. In addition, the paper also presents a closed form of the state space model for general evenly distributed RLC interconnect line circuits. The closed form has a very low computation complexity of O(1), which may be extended for use not only in circuits, but also in various complex systems with transmission lines, networks, or delay lines. Since the BTM is a popular practical model reduction method in various areas, thus this example may bring some further insight thinking for development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4670791/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393625","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An example of balanced truncation method and its surprising time domain performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An example of balanced truncation method and its surprising time domain performance","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047405S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4670793,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Dalian Nationalities of University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Lijun Liu","id":"37087653239"},{"name":"Hongjie Xing","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Hongjie Xing","id":"37087693198"},{"name":"Dong Nan","affiliation":["College of Applied Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Nan","id":"37087691812"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670793","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670793","abstract":"In this paper a simple infinity norm based neural network algorithm for estimation of the principal component is developed.

sets and stable attractors of Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks","abstract":"This paper proposes to study the activity invariant sets and exponentially stable attractors of Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks. The concept of activity invariant sets deeply describes the property of an invariant set by that the activity of some neurons keeps invariant all the time. Conditions are obtained for locating activity invariant sets. Under some conditions, it shows that an invariant set can have one equilibrium point which is exponentially stable. Since the attractors are located in activity invariant sets, each attractor has binary pattern and also carries analog information.

Multi-resolution measure data can be obtained by using lifting wavelet transform in the algorithm which has the advantages of computing easier, maneuvering detection delay smaller and detection probability higher. A framework of five-layer lifting wavelet decomposition was used for target movement track, the out-put multi-resolution measure data are used to update the target state of interacting multi-model algorithm.

Course scheduling in colleges and universities is a highly complicated task for satisfying multiple constraints. Conventional course scheduling is done mainly from the schoolpsilas point of view, such that courses and timetables are planned according to the characteristics of individual departments and institutes, with little attention to studentspsila interests and their needs in career development. This study develops a practical automatic course scheduling system based on studentspsila needs, wherein the course scheduling process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, studentspsila needs in course selection are considered and an association among courses selected by students is mined using the association mining technique; while in the second stage, the genetic algorithm is used to arrange the course timetable. More particularly, this study is based on studentspsila willingness in course selection, analyzes the effects of course arrangement in different class periods on studentspsila learning performance, takes into account teacherspsila preferred schedules, determines the cost function value of each class period, and then applies the genetic algorithm for class period exchange, so as to produce an optimal course timetable. It is shown in the experiment results that the automatic course scheduling system proposed in this study not only can efficiently replace the onerous operation of conventional manual course scheduling, but also produce course timetables that truly fulfill userspsila needs and increase studentspsila and teacherspsila satisfaction, thereby providing a win-win-win solution for students, teachers and the school.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670852","startPage":"400","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of data mining technique and genetic algorithm to an automatic course scheduling system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670852/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the application of data mining technique and genetic algorithm to an automatic course scheduling system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670852/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393674","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of data mining technique and genetic algorithm to an automatic course scheduling system","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058497S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4670853,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Jianfang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Shi Jianfang","id":"37087441278"},{"name":"Qi Le","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Qi Le","id":"37087440485"},{"name":"HuangYue","affiliation":["Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, CN"],"lastName":"HuangYue","id":"37087999190"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670853","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Fuzzy neural networks","Acceleration","Filtering algorithms","State estimation","Radar tracking","Kalman filters","Inference algorithms","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","sensor fusion","statistical analysis","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maneuvering target tracking algorithm","fuzzy neural network","interacting multiple model","statistical model","constant speed model","fuzzy logic inference","self-learning ability","optimization","Monte-Carlo simulation","data association"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maneuvering Target Tracking","Fuzzy Neural Network","Interacting Multiple Model","Current Statistical Model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670853","abstract":"An algorithm which interacts current statistical model and constant speed model together can have no limit to the magnitude of target turn rate and its variety.

Texture characteristics and color moments are used to distinguish objects of similar shape and different appearance. Hupsilas moment invariants have the invariance properties under rotation, scale and translation, and affine moment invariants have the invariance properties under affine transformation for the 3D objects in images. All these characteristics compose a 1-dimensional feature vector of 23 components for each 2D image of 3D objects, and then they are presented to a BP neural network for training. The trained BP network can be used to recognize 3D objects when provided the feature vectors of unseen views. We assessed our method based on both the original and noise corrupted COIL-100 3D objects dataset and achieved 100% correct rate of recognition when training views were presented every 10 degrees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670860/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393682","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670860/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3D object recognition using multiple features and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D object recognition using multiple features and neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046232S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4670864,"authors":[{"name":"Yongguo Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory on Machine Perception, Peking University, Beijing, China","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yongguo Liu","id":"37087221390"},{"name":"Mao Ye","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Mao Ye","id":"37087313073"},{"name":"Jun Peng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Peng","id":"37538657800"},{"name":"Hong Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Hong Wu","id":"37085959982"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670864","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670864","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Biological cells","Genetic engineering","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering methods","Computer science","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","clusters optimal number","automatic genetic clustering for unknown K","Davies-Bouldin index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering","genetic algorithms","noising method","Davies-Bouldin index"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670864","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670864.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding the optimal number of clusters using genetic algorithms","abstract":"In clustering analysis, many methods require the designer to provide the number of clusters.

Segmentations on several types of image are implemented with the proposed method and the experimental results demonstrate its validity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670905","startPage":"744","endPage":"748","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670905.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-object segmentation based on pulse coupled neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Image segmentation","Joining processes","Biological neural networks","Pulse generation","Pulse modulation","Electronic mail","Pixel","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobject segmentation","pulse coupled neural network","image segmentation","synchronous pulse burst","animal visual cortex"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["The Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN)","Automatically Image Segmentation","Parameter Determination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-object segmentation based on pulse coupled neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670905/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393727","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-object segmentation based on pulse coupled neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065048S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4670912,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lei","affiliation":["School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jie Lei","id":"37087351315"},{"name":"Yongjie Li","affiliation":["School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yongjie Li","id":"37087167285"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670912","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Encoding","Biological information theory","Signal processing algorithms","DNA computing","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing","Optimization methods","Technology planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputing","biology computing","genetic algorithms","intensity modulation","radiation therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA genetic algorithm","beam angle selection","radiotherapy planning","evolutionary algorithms","intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning","beam angle optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam angle optimization","DNA computation","intensity-modulated radiotheropy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670912","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664825/4670728/04670912.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DNA genetic algorithm for beam angle selection in radiotherapy planning","abstract":"There are few of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) considering the influence of bit positions when mutation operation is implemented.

This method combines the symbolic method with the numerical method. Based on the complete discrimination system of polynomial, the number and multiplicities of the distinct real roots of polynomials can be explicit determined. According to the number of the distinct real roots, a neural networks model for finding the multiple real roots of polynomial is established. From the description of the new model, it is not difficult to find that the existent neural networks for finding real roots of polynomial is the special case of the new one, where all of the real roots are treated as different values. Through training the new model by the gradient descent method, the approximate real roots of polynomial can be obtained. From the simulation results, it is shown that, comparing to the existent neural networks of finding real roots, the new method is not only more effective, but also can avoid the inequality between two or more equal real roots after finishing to solve the polynomial.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4670918/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393740","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4670918/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Finding multiple real roots by neural networks based on complete discrimination system of polynomial","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding multiple real roots by neural networks based on complete discrimination system of polynomial","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081186S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664825","isNumber":"4670728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4670728","articleId":"4670918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4670927,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-wu Zhang","affiliation":["Computer and Information Institute, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xue-wu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405059300"},{"name":"Yan-yun Lv","affiliation":["Computer and Information Institute, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan-yun","lastName":"Lv","id":"38100569600"},{"name":"Yan-qiong Ding","affiliation":["Computer and Information Institute, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan-qiong","lastName":"Ding","id":"37654708300"},{"name":"Zhen-tao Zhou","affiliation":["Computer and Information Institute, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-tao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37087935766"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1673-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1674-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"4670927","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4670927","abstract":"The quality of copper strips directly affects the performance and quality of copper and its products.

Inspired by model of JPEG-LS, the proposed encoder consists of fuzzy neural network predictor, adaptive correction part based on context and adaptive arithmetic coder. As in JPEG-LS, it is a empirically observed that the global statistics of residuals from the ANN fixed predictor in raw data, which effectively exploits structural redundancies between mosaic-like color components, are well-modeled by a TSGD centered at zero.

Consequently, we can encode mosaic images on the fly at low complexity level.

A new resistance balancing circuit technique is also introduced, which permits further reduction of DC offsets in conventional chopping operational amplifier (op-amp) or chopping differential difference amplifier (DDA). The HSPICE simulation results have validated the proposed technique and identified dominant error sources using Level-49 BSIM3 model in a standard 0.6-mum CMOS technology. Applying the technique to the fabricated DDA chips at a noninverting gain of ten and a single 3-V supply, the measured results have shown that 40% of the ten samples display no more than 3- and 5-muV offsets at the chopping frequency of 10 and 64 kHz, respectively.

Following the square-root B-spline NN approximation to the measured output pdf, the problem is transferred into the tracking of dynamic weights. Different from the previous related works, time-delay dynamic NNs with undetermined parameters are employed to identify the nonlinear relationships between the control input and the weighting vectors. In order to achieve the required control objective and satisfy the state constraints due to the property of output pdfs, a constrained PI tracking controller is designed by solving a class of linear matrix inequalities and algebraic equations. With the proposed tracking controller and adaptive projection algorithms, both identification and tracking errors can be made to converge to zero, and the state constraints can also be simultaneously guaranteed. Finally, two simulated examples are given, which effectively demonstrate the use of the proposed control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2007069","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5153552/04671053.pdf","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2007069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained PI Tracking Control for Output Probability Distributions Based on Two-Step Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Constrained PI Tracking Control for Output Probability Distributions Based on Two-Step Neural Networks","volume":"56","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10811861","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4671053/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained PI Tracking Control for Output Probability Distributions Based on Two-Step Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-yyi-2007069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094473S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5153552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5153552","articleId":"4671053","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4671058,"authors":[{"name":"Wu-Hua Chen","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, NSW, Australia","College of Mathematics and Information Science, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5089871/4671058/4671058-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wu-Hua Chen received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, China, the M.Sc. degree in basic mathematics from the Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1988, 1991, and 2004, respectively.","From 1991 to 2001, he was with the Guangxi University for Nationalities, Nanning, China.

Three types of impulses are considered: the impulses are input disturbances; the impulses are ldquoneutralrdquo type (that is, they are neither helpful for stability of neural networks nor destabilizing); and the impulses are stabilizing. For each type of impulses, by using Lyapunov function and Razumikhin-type techniques, the sufficient conditions for global exponential stability are developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities with respect to suitable classes of impulse time sequences. The new sufficient stability conditions do not impose any restriction on the size of time-delay.

The prototype filter is realized with a passive pole at the filter input and a fourth-order leapfrog filter in which the gm-C technique with pseudodifferential transconductors is used. The transconductors do not include internal nodes, and they are designed to have a nominal 26-dB dc gain, of which process, voltage, and temperature variations are controlled by means of a negative resistance circuit. The losses of the low-dc-gain filter integrators are already taken into account in the filter synthesis. The passband edge frequency of the implemented filter is 240 MHz in order to receive multiband-orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing signals using the direct-conversion topology. The voltage gain of the filter can be controlled from 9 to 43 dB in the 1-dB gain steps. The filter achieves a 7.8-nVradicHz input-referred noise density, a -8-dBV out-of-band third-order intermodulation intercept point, and a +15-dBV out-of-band second-order intermodulation intercept point. The circuit uses a 1.2-V supply and has been fabricated in a modern 65-nm CMOS technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5153552/04671060.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2006213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2006213","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 240-MHz Low-Pass Filter With Variable Gain in 65-nm CMOS for a UWB Radio Receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671060/","displayDocTitle":"A 240-MHz Low-Pass Filter With Variable Gain in 65-nm CMOS for a UWB Radio Receiver","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671060/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10811864","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 240-MHz Low-Pass Filter With Variable Gain in 65-nm CMOS for a UWB Radio Receiver","sourcePdf":"tcsi-saari-2006213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178054S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5153552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5153552","articleId":"4671060","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4671061,"authors":[{"name":"Jesus Arias","affiliation":["Departamento de Electricidad y Electr\u00f3nica, ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5153552/4671061/4671061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jesus Arias received the Licenciado en F\u00edsica and Ph.D. degrees in sciences (physics) from the Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain, in 1989 and 1995, respectively.","Since 1989, he has been with the Departamento de Electricidad y Electr\u00f3nica, ESTI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Valladolid, where he is currently a Professor in electronics.

The overall CT DeltaSigma converter consists of two modulators covering two unequal subbands (low-pass (LP) and bandpass (BP) subbands) that are arranged to operate in parallel and whose respective noise transfer functions (NTFs) are designed to match its corresponding frequency band. The composite NTF for the overall converter is defined as the minimum gain value out of these two individual NTFs. The LP and BP subbands were designed by using third- and fourth-order modulators, respectively, based on a 3-bit quantizer and operating at a clock frequency of 1056 MHz. NTF zero locations were optimized according to the criterion that all the in-band composite NTF gain maxima have approximately the same value. Combining OFDM signal characteristics and converter parameters, the effect of the quantization noise on the overall converter performance has been analytically derived.

Taking a general nature of fault in the master system into account, a new synchronization scheme, namely, fault-tolerant master-slave synchronization, is proposed, by which the master-slave synchronization can be achieved no matter if the fault occurs or not. By making use of an observer-based fault estimator and a modified time-delay feedback controller, the fault-tolerant master-slave synchronization is formulated so as to discuss the global asymptotic stability of the error system and the bound of energy gain from fault to state and fault estimation error vectors. Some new delay-dependent criteria are derived to analyze the synchronization error system, and based on the analysis results, a sufficient condition on the existence of such a master-slave synchronization scheme and a solution to the controller and fault-estimator gain matrices are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a Chua's circuit is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2006218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5153552/04671064.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2006218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Master\u2013Slave Synchronization for Lur'e Systems Using Time-Delay Feedback Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671064/","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Master\u2013Slave Synchronization for Lur'e Systems Using Time-Delay Feedback Control","volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10798140","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671064/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Master\u2013Slave Synchronization for Lur'e Systems Using Time-Delay Feedback Control","sourcePdf":"tcsi-qhan-2006218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104289S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5153552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5153552","articleId":"4671064","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4671065,"authors":[{"name":"Chinmaya Mishra","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5153552/4671065/4671065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chinmaya Mishra (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.E.

The architecture comprises an array of adaptive floating-gate comparators that enables storage and programming of reference levels, eliminating the need for resistive ladders. Reference levels may be programmed either manually by the user or autonomously during normal analog-to-digital conversion. Autonomous programming achieves histogram equalization by adjusting reference levels for finer resolution and greater sensitivity at frequently visited signal values. When programmed manually, the ADC achieves 34.3-dB SNDR at 750 MS/s for input frequencies up to 2.07times Nyquist rate, with a differential full-scale input range of 1 V. We observe integral nonlinearity and differential nonlinearity of less than 0.27 least significant bit at the Nyquist rate.

The emphases of the design are micropower operation and small IC area, and these attributes are achieved in several ways. First, a maximum of three signed power-of-two terms accompanied with sign magnitude data representation is used for the multiplier operand. Second, the least significant partial products are truncated to yield a 16-bit signed product. An error correction methodology is proposed to mitigate, where appropriate, the arising truncation errors. The errors arising from truncation and the effectiveness of the error correction are analytically derived. Third, a low-power shifter design and an internal latch adder are adopted. Finally, a power-efficient speculative delay line is proposed to time the async operation of the various circuit modules. A comparison with competing synchronous and async designs shows that the proposed design features the lowest power dissipation (5.86 muW at 1.1 V and 1 MHz) and a very competitive IC area (0.08 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n using a 0.35-mum CMOS process).

Such an RNN is designed based on a matrix-valued error function instead of a scalar-valued error function. In addition, it was depicted in an implicit dynamics instead of an explicit dynamics. In this paper, we develop and investigate a discrete-time model of Zhang neural network (termed as such and abbreviated as ZNN for presentation convenience), which is depicted by a system of difference equations. Comparing with Newton iteration for matrix inversion, we find that the discrete-time ZNN model incorporates Newton iteration as its special case. Noticing this relation, we perform numerical comparisons on different situations of using ZNN and Newton iteration for matrix inversion. Different kinds of activation functions and different step-size values are examined for superior convergence and better stability of ZNN. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of both ZNN and Newton iteration for online matrix inversion.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2007065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5153552/04671073.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2007065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Zhang Neural Network to Newton Iteration for Matrix Inversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671073/","displayDocTitle":"From Zhang Neural Network to Newton Iteration for Matrix Inversion","volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10798143","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671073/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Zhang Neural Network to Newton Iteration for Matrix Inversion","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhang-2007065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144088S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5153552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5153552","articleId":"4671073","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4671074,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Lang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Lang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278393800"},{"name":"Yin-Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan","Institute for Information Industry, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yin-Cheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37879470100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"4671074","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":691},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","OFDM","Bandwidth","Frequency division multiplexing","Equalizers","Wireless LAN","Fading","Wideband","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time-block-code","MIMO ZP-OFDM system","multiple-input-multiple-output system","zero-padding system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","semiblind channel estimation","channel equalization","Alamouti-like STBC scheme","channel impulse response","ambiguity matrices","frequency domain minimum mean-square error","forward-backward averaging technique","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer","multiuser detection","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","semiblind channel estimation","space\u2013time coding (STC)"]}],"abstract":"The space-time-block-code (STBC) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) zero-padding orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ZP-OFDM) has been widely investigated in recent years.

In this paper, novel channel estimation and equalization for complex input signals are investigated. With the Alamouti-like STBC scheme, the channel impulse responses of the space-time-coded MIMO ZP-OFDM system are shown to be identifiable up to two ambiguity matrices by subspace channel estimation. The frequency domain minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer is then employed to detect the OFDM symbols. Furthermore, we propose a forward-backward averaging technique to enhance the performances of blind channel estimation. The weight analysis for the MMSE equalizer is also conducted to reduce the complexity of system design.

The optimal design of the training structure is formulated here by finding the training length (the optimal number of contiguous pilots) and the training interval (the interval among two successive training phases) to maximize system throughput. The optimal balance of training and payload depends on the combination of Doppler frequency and frame length. The level of the signal to noise ratio and the fading dynamics constrain the quality of the estimate from training. It is shown that the length of the training can be conveniently traded for lower training intervals to reduce the estimate out-dating. For fast-varying fading and for high enough signal to noise ratio, there is a definite advantage in fragmenting the frame with dispersed segments of training symbols of smaller length rather than having a highly reliable channel estimate by concentrating all the training symbols at the beginning of the frame. Extensive simulations corroborate the design criteria. System throughput is maximized either for noisy binary transmission and for Gaussian input symbol distribution (i.e., by using information theoretic analysis).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04671094.pdf","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2009270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2009270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Training Lengths and Training Intervals in Time-Varying Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Channel estimation","Throughput","Payloads","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Sampling methods","Frequency","Gaussian noise","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","Gaussian distribution","least mean squares methods","Markov processes","optimisation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying fading channel","channel estimation","training length optimization","training interval optimization","Doppler frequency","noisy binary transmission","Gaussian input symbol distribution","information theoretic analysis","MMSE","Markov process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gauss\u2013Markov fading","MMSE channel estimation","throughput optimization","time-varying fading channels","training based channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Training Lengths and Training Intervals in Time-Varying Fading Channels","volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4671094/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10498791","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Training Lengths and Training Intervals in Time-Varying Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"57tsp03-ssavazzi-2009270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093115S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4671094","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4671095,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Tichavsky","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Tichavsky","id":"37347568200"},{"name":"Arie Yeredor","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Arie","lastName":"Yeredor","id":"37283864600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4671095","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":129,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":883},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671095","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Blind source separation","Symmetric matrices","Iterative algorithms","Large-scale systems","Biomedical computing","Predictive models","Autoregressive processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","blind source separation","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","iterative methods","least squares approximations","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate joint diagonalization","AJD algorithm","nontrivial block-diagonal weight matrices","weighted least-squares criterion","blind source separation","iteratively reweighted separation scheme","block-stationary Gaussian source","sample covariance matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate joint diagonalization (AJD)","auto regressive processes","blind source separation (BSS)","nonstationary random processes"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new low-complexity approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) algorithm, which incorporates nontrivial block-diagonal weight matrices into a weighted least-squares (WLS) AJD criterion.

Before unwrapping, we usually have to restore the data image by reducing so-called singular points (SPs) by filtering process without destroying or smearing delicate fringes. Previously, an effective SP restoration method was proposed based on the complex-valued Markov random field (CMRF) model. However, there is still room for improvement in the definition of SPs and in the formulation of CMRF parameter estimation. In this letter, we propose a novel scheme by introducing a new concept, namely, the ldquosingular unit.rdquo We also estimate CMRF parameters locally as a weighted sum by taking the distance and SP numbers in sample sites into account.

We also find that delicate landscape features, which are often lost in conventional filtering, are preserved appropriately.

In this scenario, the existence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation paths has been considered to be the main drawback to achieve high precision in positioning, since NLOS propagation introduces large and unpredictable errors in the time estimates that are obtained from the measurements. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called prior NLOS measurement correction (PNMC), to effectively correct the measurements from NLOS propagation in a previous stage to the positioning process. PNMC is based on a statistical processing of a record of measurements taken over a time window. This processing relies on the statistical estimate of the NLOS measurement ratio present in our record. This estimate is used to range the NLOS recorded measurements into segments. Finally, the correction is carried out by subtracting the expected NLOS errors for each segment. Several simulations have been conducted to show the increase in accuracy obtained by the usage of PNMC and the great improvement that this prior measurement correction means to subsequent wireless location and positioning techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4671108/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10630442","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Prior NLOS Measurement Correction for Positioning in Cellular Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prior NLOS Measurement Correction for Positioning in Cellular Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-mazuelas-2009305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072285S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4671108","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4671109,"authors":[{"name":"Yacine Amara","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Automatique du Havre (GREAH), University of Le Havre, Le Havre, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4671109/4671109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yacine Amara (S'00\u2013M'03) was born in Algiers, Algeria, in 1975.

It is shown that SVM provides a number of degrees of freedom, which make it suitable for optimization, subject to desired constraints. An objective function is defined, which seeks to minimize the most significant harmonic components of the generated waveform while keeping other harmonic components within the acceptable range outlined in the available standards. Since the formulation of the problem involves both real and integer variables, specialized optimization methods capable of handling mixed-integer variables need to be employed, and hence, a genetic algorithm optimizer is used to solve the optimization problem. Optimized SVM sequences obtained for various operating points under different sampling frequencies are shown to result in significant reduction of dominant harmonics while maintaining the waveform quality within prescribed limits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04671111.pdf","startPage":"2894","endPage":"2903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2008997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2008997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized Space Vector Modulation Sequence for Improved Harmonic Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Support vector machines","Converters","Power conversion","Pulse width modulation","Power harmonic filters","Optimization methods","Voltage control","Switching frequency","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power conversion harmonics","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector modulation sequence","genetic algorithms","harmonic analysis","voltage source converter","waveform quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms (GAs)","harmonic analysis","optimization","space vector modulation (SVM)","voltage-sourced converter (VSC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized Space Vector Modulation Sequence for Improved Harmonic Performance","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4671111/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793120","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized Space Vector Modulation Sequence for Improved Harmonic Performance","sourcePdf":"tie-filizadeh-2008997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094166S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4671111","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4671112,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Zaragoza","affiliation":["Terrassa Industrial Electronics Group TIEG, Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Terrassa, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4771829/4671112/4671112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jordi Zaragoza (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in automatic and electronic industrial engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Terrassa, Spain, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

The technique uses two modulation signals per phase, and it is called double-signal pulsewidth modulation. It completely eliminates low-frequency oscillations in the neutral-point voltage. However, it does not provide natural voltage balancing; therefore, a compensation loop is required. The proposed control generates a feedback compensation signal that correctly modifies the three-phase modulation signals. The optimal compensation signal is calculated by a dynamic limiter according to the intrinsic limitations of the system related to the variability range of the modulation signals. It significantly improves the voltage balancing under all operating conditions of the converter. In addition, this compensation strategy does not increase the switching frequencies of the power devices. The algorithm is tested and verified using both simulation and experimentation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04671112.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2009195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2009195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Balance Compensator for a Carrier-Based Modulation in the Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Capacitors","Phase modulation","Pulse modulation","Wind energy generation","Industrial electronics","Power engineering and energy","Voltage control","Space vector pulse width modulation","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","feedback","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal voltage-balance compensator","carrier-based modulation","neutral-point-clamped converter","double-signal pulsewidth modulation","low-frequency oscillation elimination","feedback compensation signal control","power device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier-based modulation","neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter","optimal compensator","three-level converter","voltage balance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Balance Compensator for a Carrier-Based Modulation in the Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4671112/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10469641","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Balance Compensator for a Carrier-Based Modulation in the Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-pou-2009195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105884S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4671112","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4671118,"authors":[{"name":"Jierong Cheng","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4838904/4671118/4671118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jierong Cheng received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2007.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the BioInformatics Research Centre, Nanyang Technological University.

The experimental findings are related to a previously developed analytical model of Gubarenko , which is used to determine when a fluidic interface under electrical stress is in equilibrium, and to observations reported in the literature. The effect of key parameters on causing the interface to rupture, form, and maintain an electrospray is investigated. The experimental results reveal the dependence of interface shape on operational parameters, the impact of the interface apex angle on equilibrium, the conditions that cause either dripping mode or cone-jet mode, and the structure of operational domains. This paper confirms predictions made using the analytical model, including the range of parameters that cause the onset and steadiness of a quasi-equilibrium (electrospray) state of the interface. Testing is performed using an electrospray emitter chip fabricated from two layers of Polydimethylsiloxane and one layer of glass. The model and experimental results assist in design decisions for electrospray emitters. Applications of electrified interfaces (electrosprays) are found in mass spectrometry, microfluidics, material deposition, and colloidal thrusters for propulsion.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4681904/04671124.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1375","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2006822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2006822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an Equilibrium Model for an Electrified Fluid Interface\u2014Electrospray Using a PDMS Microfluidic Device","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Mass spectroscopy","Analytical models","Shape","Biological materials","Propulsion","Spraying","Molecular biophysics","Industrial engineering","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mass spectroscopy","microfluidics","polymers","sprays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equilibrium model","electrified fluid interface","electrospray","microfluidic device","polydimethylsiloxane","electrical stress","glass","mass spectrometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fabrication","fluidics","interface phenomena","microelectromechanical devices","spraying"]},{"kwd":["Fabrication","fluidics","interface phenomena","microelectromechanical devices","spraying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of an Equilibrium Model for an Electrified Fluid Interface\u2014Electrospray Using a PDMS Microfluidic Device","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4671124/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348079","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an Equilibrium Model for an Electrified Fluid Interface\u2014Electrospray Using a PDMS Microfluidic Device","sourcePdf":"jmems-sullivan-2006822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113805S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4681904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4681904","articleId":"4671124","onlineDate":"11 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4671127,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Unlike electron trapping that reduces rapidly for thinner Hf dielectric layer, positive charges cannot be reduced by using a thinner HfSiON film.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2008.2006288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4671136/04671147.pdf","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2008.2006288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dominant Layer for Stress-Induced Positive Charges in Hf-Based Gate Stacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671147/","displayDocTitle":"Dominant Layer for Stress-Induced Positive Charges in Hf-Based Gate Stacks","volume":"29","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324466","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671147/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dominant Layer for Stress-Induced Positive Charges in Hf-Based Gate Stacks","sourcePdf":"led-zhang-2006288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06977S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4671136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4671136","articleId":"4671147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4671151,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, their different code structures usually lead to different hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose a unified decoder architecture that is capable of decoding both LDPC and turbo codes with a limited hardware overhead. We employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm as a bridge between LDPC and turbo codes. We represent LDPC codes as parallel concatenated single parity check (PCSPC) codes and propose a group sub-trellis (GST) decoding algorithm for the efficient decoding of PCSPC codes. This algorithm achieves about 2X improvement in the convergence speed and is more numerically robust than the classical ldquotanhrdquo algorithm. What is more interesting is that we can generalize a unified trellis decoding algorithm for LDPC and turbo codes based on their trellis structures. We propose a reconfigurable computation kernel for log-MAP decoding of LDPC and turbo codes at a cost of ~15% hardware overhead. Small lookup tables (LUTs) with 9 entries of 2-bit data are designed to implement the log-MAP algorithm. Fixed point (6:2) simulation results show that there is negligible or nearly no performance loss by using this LUT approximation compared to the ideal case. The proposed architecture results in scalable and flexible datapath units enabling parallel decoding of LDPC/turbo codes.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671730","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671730.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified decoder architecture for LDPC/turbo codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Unified decoder architecture for LDPC/turbo codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671730/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10388946","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671730/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified decoder architecture for LDPC/turbo codes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063655S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4671733,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik Naessens","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Naessens","id":"37296846800"},{"name":"Bruno Bougard","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bougard","id":"37271999100"},{"name":"Siebert Bressinck","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Siebert","lastName":"Bressinck","id":"37869561000"},{"name":"Lieven Hollevoet","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"Hollevoet","id":"37391993300"},{"name":"Praveen Raghavan","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37411797200"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"},{"name":"Francky Catthoor","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francky","lastName":"Catthoor","id":"37275971400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2923-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4671733","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":372},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Computer architecture","Baseband","Throughput","Parity check codes","Communication standards","Costs","Software radio","Energy efficiency","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","computer architecture","digital video broadcasting","forward error correction","instruction sets","parity check codes","personal area networks","software radio","turbo codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified instruction set programmable architecture","multistandard advanced forward error correction","software defined radio","radio baseband architectures","FEC","turbo-code","LPDC code","3GPP-LTE","IEEE802.11n","IEEE802.16(e)","DVB-S2-T2"]}],"abstract":"The continuously increasing number of communication standards to be supported in nomadic devices combined with the fast ramping design cost in deep submicron technologies claim for highly reusable and flexible programmable solutions. Software defined radio (SDR) aims at providing such solutions in radio baseband architectures. Great advances were recently booked in handset-targeted SDR, covering most of the baseband processing with satisfactory performance and energy efficiency. However, as it typically depicts a magnitude higher computation load, forward error correction (FEC) has been excluded from the scope of high throughput SDR solutions and let to dedicated hardware accelerators. The currently growing number of advanced FEC options claims however for flexibility there too. This paper presents the first application-specific instruction programmable architecture addressing in a unified way the emerging turbo- and LPDC coding requirements of 3GPP-LTE, IEEE802.11n, IEEE802.16(e) and DVB-S2/T2. The proposal shows a throughput from 0.07 to 1.25 Mbps/MHz with efficiencies round 0.32 nJ/bit/iter in turbo mode and round 0.085 nJ/bit/iter in LDPC mode.

We exploit the fact that in the frequency domain, information is concentrated in certain regions. Consequently, it is sufficient to compute partial 2D Fourier transform where only m times m elements of an N times N image are nonzero. Compared with the traditional row-column (RC) decomposition algorithm, the proposed algorithm enables us to reconstruct images with significantly smaller computation complexity at the expense of mild degradation in quality. We also describe the implementation of the new reconstruction algorithm on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro-100 FPGA. For 512 times 512 natural and aerial images, this implementation results in 68% reduction in the number of memory accesses and 76% reduction in the total computation time compared to the RC method.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671736","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671736.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient image reconstruction using partial 2D Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671736/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient image reconstruction using partial 2D Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392646","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671736/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient image reconstruction using partial 2D Fourier transform","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05112S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4671741,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Weiguo Tang","id":"37599120100"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Lei Wang","id":"37293100600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2923-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4671741","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"abstract":"This paper presents a new energy-efficient cooperative sensor network scheme. Cooperative nodes shift the carrier frequency of the source node, and the destination node receives the signal from the source node and the cooperative nodes as a standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver. The maximal ratio combining (MRC) approach is applied to achieve full diversity with low complexity. The proposed scheme is scalable with respect to the number of nodes and is robust to time synchronization. A clustered network topology and cooperation protocol are proposed to realize multi-hop long haul signal transmission. The effect of the cluster scale is studied thoroughly to obtain the optimal size of clusters subject to the cooperation overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed cooperation scheme can consistently reduce the transmission power with the increase of cooperation scale. However, there is an optimal cluster scale where a good tradeoff between the diversity gain and cooperation cost can be established to minimize the total power consumption of the whole network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671741.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative OFDM for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Energy efficiency","Wireless sensor networks","Diversity reception","Robustness","Frequency synchronization","Network topology","Protocols","Spread spectrum communication","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","OFDM modulation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","energy-efficient wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient cooperative sensor network scheme","source node","destination node","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing receiver","maximal ratio combining approach","time synchronization","cooperation protocol","multihop long haul signal transmission","diversity gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative OFDM for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392650","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative OFDM for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07904S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4671743,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Priewasser","affiliation":[" Embedded Systems & Signal Processing, Klagenfurt University, Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Priewasser","id":"37391542400"},{"name":"Mario Huemer","affiliation":[" Embedded Systems & Signal Processing, Klagenfurt University, Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Huemer","id":"37332452100"},{"name":"Bruno Bougard","affiliation":["Wireless Group IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bougard","id":"37271999100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2923-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4671743","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671743","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Parity check codes","Performance analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Communication standards","Forward error correction","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Computer architecture","Application specific processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trade-off analysis","decoding algorithms","multistandard LDPC decoder","low-density parity-check codes","IEEE 802.11n","IEEE 802.16e","DVB-S2","multimode decoder architectures","min-sum approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","forward error correction","SDR","trade-off analysis","fixed-point refinement"]}],"abstract":"Since Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes deliver excellent decoding performance, they are adopted in several recent communication standards like the IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e and DVB-S2.

In this paper, we propose to use Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for error correction in MLC flash memory. A (828, 820) RS code has almost the same rate and length in terms of bits as a BCH (8248, 8192) code. Moreover, it has at least the same error-correcting performance in flash memory applications. Nevertheless, with 70% of the area, the RS decoder can achieve a throughput that is 121% higher than the BCH decoder. A novel bit mapping scheme using gray code is also proposed in this paper. Compared to direct bit mapping, our proposed scheme can achieve 0.02 dB and 0.2 dB additional gains by using RS and BCH codes, respectively, without any overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671744/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10388951","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4671744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Error correction for multi-level NAND flash memory using Reed-Solomon codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error correction for multi-level NAND flash memory using Reed-Solomon codes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044427S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4671748,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","ESAT, K.U.

Hence, algorithms and implementations of soft-output sphere decoders have attracted intensive interest in recent years. Practical soft-output sphere decoder implementations often consist of a list generator and a LLR generator. Most existing implementations focus on the list generator, and the LLR generator is implemented in a relatively straightforward way. However, the LLR generator accounts for a great part of the complexity. Our contribution is an implementation friendly low complexity multiplierless LLR generator. We apply selective and incremental updating, algebraic simplifications and strength reductions to reduce the algorithmic complexity and to eliminate all multiplications. When integrated with the SSFE list generator, our scheme not only remove 100% multiplications, but also remove 26% to 83% additions, 76% to 94% bit-shifts and 63% to 91% memory operations. Besides the algorithmic aspects, we extract the key data-flow block with well-defined control signals. This can be easily mapped onto micro-architectures and implemented as the data-path in ASICs, or a function unit in ASIPs.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671748","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671748.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671748","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementation friendly low complexity multiplierless LLR generator for soft MIMO sphere decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An implementation friendly low complexity multiplierless LLR generator for soft MIMO sphere decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671748/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392653","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementation friendly low complexity multiplierless LLR generator for soft MIMO sphere decoders","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041758S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4671752,"authors":[{"name":"Renfei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Renfei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37575729300"},{"name":"Keshab K.

Our study focused on segmenting different CAPTCHA characters to show the importance of visual preprocessing in recognition. Traditional character recognition systems show a low recognition rate for CAPTCHA characters due to their noisy backgrounds and distorted characters. We imitated the human visual attention system to let a recognition system know where to focus on despite the noise. The preprocessed characters were then recognized by an OCR system. For the CAPTHA characters we tested, the overall recognition rate increased from 16.63% to 70.74% after preprocessing. From our experimental results, we found out the importance of preprocessing for character recognition. Also, by imitating the human visual system, a more unified model can be built. The model presented is an instance for a certain type of visual recognition problem and can be generalized to cope with broader domains.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671755","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","startPage":"158","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired unified model of visual segmentation system for CAPTCHA character recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired unified model of visual segmentation system for CAPTCHA character recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671755/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388957","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4671755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired unified model of visual segmentation system for CAPTCHA character recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070206S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4671762,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Jung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ting-Jung Lin","id":"37878212100"},{"name":"Shu-Yen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shu-Yen Lin","id":"37576354900"},{"name":"An-Yeu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"An-Yeu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37271932500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2923-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4671762","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Runtime","Hardware","Costs","Network topology","Network interfaces","Scalability","Intellectual property","Telecommunication network reliability","Multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","network interfaces","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic-balanced IP mapping algorithm","2D-mesh on-chip-network","intellectual property","network topology","network interface","branch and bound search","system-on-chip design","network router"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interconnection networks","network interfaces"]}],"abstract":"Intellectual Properties (IPs) mapping algorithms for On-Chip-Networks (OCNs) allocate a set of IPs onto given network topologies. The existing mapping algorithms limit a single IP to connect to a single router. Hence, the IPs with large communication volumes will result in heavy traffic loads of certain routers. Those routers may become hot spots due to high power density, which affects the reliability of chips. In this paper, new Network Interfaces (NIs) were proposed to solve the aforementioned problem. Traffic-Balanced Mapping Algorithm (TBMAP) is also proposed based on the new NIs. The traffic loads then become more decentralized, and the traffic of all the routers on the chip can be balanced without sacrificing the networking performance. The TBMAP has short runtime to achieve balanced network traffic loads, which leads to the enhanced performance of OCNs. The experimental results show that at least 24% communication time is saved for real applications.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671762","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667697/4671720/04671762.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2008.4671762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-balanced IP mapping algorithm for 2D-mesh On-Chip-Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4671762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4671762/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-balanced IP mapping algorithm for 2D-mesh On-Chip-Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388961","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4671762/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-balanced IP mapping algorithm for 2D-mesh On-Chip-Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062131S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667697","isNumber":"4671720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667697","xplore-issue":"4671720","articleId":"4671762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4671765,"authors":[{"name":"Jinjin He","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Jinjin He","id":"37309557100"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Zhongfeng Wang","id":"37279255300"},{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Huaping Liu","id":"37310126400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2923-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4671765","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Modulation coding","Computer architecture","Degradation","Pipeline processing","Parallel processing","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","phase shift keying","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity 4-dimensional 8-ary trellis coded modulation","high-speed phase shift keying trellis coded modulation","transition metrics unit","parallel processing techniques","FPQA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLSI","FPGA","Trellis coded modulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low-complexity, high-speed 4-dimensional 8-ary Phase Shift Keying Trellis Coded Modulation (4-D 8PSK TCM) decoder.

Input offset voltage of 65 nm bulk CMOS SRAM sense amplifiers are measured to analyze NMOS and PMOS threshold voltage (Vtn, Vtp) variation effects and compare them with statistical models and Pelgrom model predictions. A linear statistical response surface model (RSM) relating input offset to Vtn and Vtp is shown to agree well with measured results. Designs optimized using the RSMs produce circuits with 25% lower input offset voltage spread at a cost of 10% more active device area. Statistical models for post-manufacturing configuration are postulated and shown for sub-65 nm technologies.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672006","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672006.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatch analysis and statistical design at 65 nm and below","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672006/","displayDocTitle":"Mismatch analysis and statistical design at 65 nm and below","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4672006/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatch analysis and statistical design at 65 nm and below","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074091S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4672007,"authors":[{"name":"Wenping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Wenping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292861300"},{"name":"Vijay Reddy","affiliation":["External Development and Manufacturing, Texas Instrumenits, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37266215000"},{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Bo Yang","id":"38560043100"},{"name":"Varsha Balakrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Varsha","lastName":"Balakrishnan","id":"37663109000"},{"name":"Srikanth Krishnan","affiliation":["External Development and Manufacturing, Texas Instrumenits, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37289881900"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Cao","id":"37277285000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2018-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2019-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4672007","dbTime":"44 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":840},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Stress","Predictive models","Degradation","Circuit optimization","Circuit testing","Performance analysis","Statistical analysis","Timing","Leakage current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical prediction","circuit aging","statistical reliability test","circuit speed standard deviation","logarithmic mean","leakage current","industrial technology","statistical reliability analysis","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"Accurate prediction of circuit aging and its variability is essential to reliable design and analysis. Such a capability further helps reduce the load in statistical reliability test. Based on compact models of transistor degradation and circuit performance, we develop analytical solutions that efficiently predict the statistics of both circuit timing and the leakage under temporal stress and process variations. These solutions prove that circuit aging and its variance can be fully predicted from the characteristics of transistor degradation and circuit performance sensitivity to aged parameters, independent on the type and the amount of process variations. Specific results include: (1) under variations, the standard deviation of circuit speed declines with the stress time, following a power law of 1/6; and (2) the logarithmic mean and the standard deviation of leakage current decrease with the stress time as t\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/6</sup>\n.

The converter is designed to generate an output voltage of 1.8 V out of a 3.6 V power supply. No external components are required. The maximum power conversion efficiency is 65 %, for a voltage conversion ratio of 0.5. This is a 23 % improvement compared to a linear regulator. Higher values are likely to be reached using a converter with external components, which is not the case here. Stacked transistors are used to cope with the high voltage. A novel control system based on a constant on/off-time keeps the output voltage constant at load conditions from 0 mW to 300 mW. The converter operates in discontinuous, asynchronous switching mode.

After a simplified overview of general MIMO theory, this paper presents a 2times2 MIMO 5 GHz WLAN transceiver implemented in 90 nm CMOS. Crosstalk between the different MIMO channels is shown to have a detrimental effect on MIMO performance. Such crosstalk can occur at the radio channel, between the antennas, and at the radio IC. Several architectural and circuit techniques are described that minimize crosstalk between the multiple radio chains co-existing on the same silicon die. Measurements results demonstrate the increased data rate of the fabricated system compared with a conventional single-antenna system. The paper concludes with some interesting scenarios for future MIMO evolution, including collaborative, directional and 60 GHz phased-array communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672042.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO techniques for high data rate radio communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radio communication","Crosstalk","Transceivers","Wireless communication","Digital signal processing","Wireless LAN","Circuits","Silicon","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","CMOS integrated circuits","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","signal processing","telecommunication channels","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio communications","wireless transceivers","multiple antennas","digital signal processing","superior link reliability","WLAN transceiver","CMOS","MIMO channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"MIMO techniques for high data rate radio communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4672042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388805","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO techniques for high data rate radio communications","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123333S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4672046,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan E.

Single-ended comparators are formed using digital inverters and resistors. The comparators are designed for compatibility with nanoscale CMOS lithography. A single-ended flash architecture was used without a front-end sample-and-hold. The ADC achieves a low frequency effective number of bits (ENOB) between 4.08 bits and 4.45 bits without calibration. Voltage scaling is demonstrated by 60 MS/s, 300 MS/s, and 600 MS/s operation at 0.6 V, 0.8 V, and 1 V, respectively. Power scales from 1.3 mW to 6.7 mW.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672046","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.6-to-1V inverter-based 5-bit flash ADC in 90nm digital CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Resistors","Lithography","Threshold voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits","Control systems","Analog circuits","Topology","USA Councils","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5-bit flash ADC","single-ended comparators","digital inverters","resistors","nanoscale CMOS lithography","single-ended flash architecture","frequency effective number of bits","voltage scaling","voltage 0.6 V to 1 V","power 1.3 mW to 6.7 mW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 0.6-to-1V inverter-based 5-bit flash ADC in 90nm digital CMOS","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10392491","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4672046/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672046/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.6-to-1V inverter-based 5-bit flash ADC in 90nm digital CMOS","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045293S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4672048,"authors":[{"name":"Parastoo Nikaeen","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Parastoo","lastName":"Nikaeen","id":"37564337000"},{"name":"Boris Murmann","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Murmann","id":"37300093100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2018-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2019-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4672048","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":472},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital correction of dynamic track-and-hold errors providing SFDR \u226b 83 dB up to fin = 470 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672048","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Sampling methods","Switches","Linearity","Voltage","Bandwidth","Frequency estimation","Switching circuits","Capacitors","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital correction","dynamic track-and-hold error","dynamic nonlinearities","ADC","analogue-digital conversion","size 90 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672048","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672048.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","abstract":"A digital technique for the compensation of dynamic nonlinearities at the front-end of high-speed, high-resolution ADCs is presented.

It not only combines the desirable attributes of all current memory technologies (SRAM, DRAM and flash memories) but also solves the critical drawbacks of conventional MRAM technology: poor scalability and high write current. However, variations in process parameters can lead to large number of cells to fail, severely affecting the yield of the memory array. In this paper, we provide a thorough understanding of the interrelationship between design parameters and parametric failures of STT MRAM cell in presence of process variations. Based on comprehensive physics-based model, solving the Non-Equilibrium Greenpsilas Function (NEGF) formalism in the ballistic regime, we develop an optimization methodology for robust cell design (in 1T1M configuration) to account for both stability and cell area. Further, we propose an efficient circuit design for variation tolerance. The proposed technique can effectively decouple the conflicting design requirements of read/write stability and area in conventional 1T1M cell, leading to considerably improved yield of memory array. Simulation results show that in our proposed cell, the robustness (cell stability) is improved by 36% with only 9% area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672056","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672056.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variation-tolerant Spin-Torque Transfer (STT) MRAM array for yield enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Variation-tolerant Spin-Torque Transfer (STT) MRAM array for yield enhancement","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4672056/","accessionNumber":"10392496","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variation-tolerant Spin-Torque Transfer (STT) MRAM array for yield enhancement","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060157S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4672058,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Each CAB has a wide variety of sub-circuits ranging in granularity from multipliers and programmable offset wide linear range Gm blocks to NMOS and PMOS transistors. The programmable interconnects and circuit elements in the CAB are implemented using floating gate transistors. This system exhibits significant performance enhancements over its predecessor in terms of achievable signal bandwidth (> 50 MHz), accuracy (> 9 bits), dynamic range (> 7 decades of current), speed of floating-gate programming (> 200 gates/sec) and isolation between ON and OFF switches. The improved bandwidth is primarily due to an improved routing fabric that includes nearest neighbor connections. Programming performance improved drastically by implementing the entire algorithm on-chip with an SPI digital interface. Several complex system examples are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672061.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RASP 2.8: A new generation of floating-gate based field programmable analog array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable analog arrays","Analog computers","Bandwidth","MOS devices","MOSFETs","Integrated circuit interconnections","Power system interconnection","Dynamic range","Dynamic programming","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable analogue arrays","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RASP 2.8","field programmable analog array","reconfigurable analog computing platform","computational analog blocks","NMOS transistors","PMOS transistors","programmable interconnect element","circuit elements","floating gate transistors","floating-gate programming","routing fabric","nearest neighbor connections","SPI digital interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"RASP 2.8: A new generation of floating-gate based field programmable analog array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4672061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388815","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RASP 2.8: A new generation of floating-gate based field programmable analog array","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093236S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4672064,"authors":[{"name":"Bodhisatwa Sadhu","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Bodhisatwa","lastName":"Sadhu","id":"37542588600"},{"name":"Umaikhe E.

The prototype chip implemented in a 65 nm CMOS technology has measured 734 fs RJ (rms) at the TX output when operating at 16 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672114","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672114.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clocking circuits for a 16Gb/s memory interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Clocking circuits for a 16Gb/s memory interface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388837","htmlLink":"/document/4672114/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clocking circuits for a 16Gb/s memory interface","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.147818S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4672131,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Woo Jee","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Woo Jee","id":"37087484744"},{"name":"Seung-Jin Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Jin Park","id":"37087912880"},{"name":"Hong-June Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong-June Park","id":"37087147912"},{"name":"Jae-Yoon Sim","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Yoon Sim","id":"37087447296"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2018-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2019-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4672131","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Digital control","Approximation algorithms","CMOS technology","Damping","Frequency","Digital circuits","Threshold voltage","Switching circuits","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","digital control","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage OP amp","digitally controlled algorithmic approximation","scaled CMOS technologies","digitally-assisted damping control","digital circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672131","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672131.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-voltage OP amp with digitally controlled algorithmic approximation","abstract":"This paper presents a new architecture of digitally controlled algorithmic OP amp suitable for scaled CMOS technologies.

The technique can supplement a number of common supply rejection techniques. The proposed CMOS ring oscillator is designed and implemented with a charge-pump based phase-locked loop in 65-nm technology to demonstrate the robustness against the supply fluctuation. Taking advantage of the negative static supply sensitivity of the ring oscillator with proper combination of the bias voltages, the rms jitter of the 4-GHz output clock is reduced from 10.66-ps to 5.04-ps while subject to switching noise with magnitude of 2.5% of the supply voltage at 150-MHz. Furthermore, more than 4.5times of reduction in the power consumption is achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672139.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing the supply sensitivity of CMOS ring oscillator by jointly biasing the supply and control voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Voltage control","Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS technology","Charge pumps","Phase locked loops","Noise robustness","Fluctuations","Jitter","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","oscillators","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supply sensitivity","CMOS ring oscillator","control voltage","common supply rejection techniques","charge-pump based phase-locked loop","switching noise","size 65 nm","frequency 4 GHz","frequency 150 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the supply sensitivity of CMOS ring oscillator by jointly biasing the supply and control voltage","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4672139/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392535","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the supply sensitivity of CMOS ring oscillator by jointly biasing the supply and control voltage","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0556S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4672140,"authors":[{"name":"Peter R.

The electrical interconnects are used to provide power delivery and signaling, the optical interconnects are used to enable optical signal routing to all levels of the 3D stack, and the microfluidic interconnects are used to cool each level in the 3D stack and thus enable stacking of high-performance (high-power) dice. These interconnects are integrated in a 3D stack both as through-silicon vias (TSVs) and as input/output (I/O) interconnects. Design trade-offs (TSV density, power supply noise, thermal resistance, and pump size), fabrication, and assembly are reported.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665385/4671999/04672173.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"670","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2008.4672173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2008.4672173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4671999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4672173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D heterogeneous integrated systems: Liquid cooling, power delivery, and implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Liquid cooling","Optical interconnections","Optical pumping","Microfluidics","Power system interconnection","Through-silicon vias","Thermal resistance","Integrated optics","Routing","Stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","integrated circuit interconnections","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D heterogeneous integrated systems","liquid cooling","power delivery","3D die stack","electrical interconnects","optical signal routing","microfluidic interconnects","through-silicon vias","input/output interconnects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4672173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"3D heterogeneous integrated systems: Liquid cooling, power delivery, and implementation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4672173/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392550","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D heterogeneous integrated systems: Liquid cooling, power delivery, and implementation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11072008-00174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06904S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665385","isNumber":"4671999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665385","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4671999","articleId":"4672173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4672182,"authors":[{"name":"Mozhgan Mansuri","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Mozhgan","lastName":"Mansuri","id":"37332639600"},{"name":"Frank O'Mahony","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"O'Mahony","id":"37428047200"},{"name":"Ganesh Balamurugan","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Balamurugan","id":"37273622100"},{"name":"James Jaussi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Jaussi","id":"37273622200"},{"name":"Joseph Kennedy","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37276103300"},{"name":"Sudip Shekhar","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA","University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Shekhar","id":"37272375800"},{"name":"Randy Mooney","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Mooney","id":"37273624100"},{"name":"Bryan Casper","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Casper","id":"37273619900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2018-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2019-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"4672182","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Injection-locked oscillators","Frequency","Equations","Clocks","Phase locked loops","Inductors","RLC circuits","High K dielectric materials","High-K gate dielectrics","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","injection locked oscillators","phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-Q LC oscillators","injection locking","series RL element","parallel RLC tank approximation","reduced phase shift"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new equation for injection-locked LC oscillators (ILOs) based on a series RL element in parallel with C.

Recently, along with power system privatization and deregulation, accurate forecast of electricity load has received increasing attention. Electricity load forecasting is complex to conduct due to its nonlinearity of influenced factors. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel type of learning machine, which has been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. In this paper, a new optimal model has been proposed, which integrates a traditional support vector machines (SVM) forecasting technique with the reduction attributes of rough sets (RS) based on immune genetic algorithm (IGA) to form a new forecasting model. The model is proved to be able to enhance the accuracy and search ability to the whole of the algorithm and reduce operation time by numerical experiments. Subsequently, examples of electricity load data from a city in China are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. The empirical results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the other models. Therefore, the model provides an effective and feasible arithmetic to forecast electricity load in power industry.","doi":"10.1109/ICRMEM.2008.85","pdfPath":"/iel5/4673182/4673183/04673233.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Risk Management & Engineering Management","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Risk Management & Engineering Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRMEM.2008.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4673183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electricity Load Forecasting Using Rough Set Attribute Reduction Algorithm Based on Immune Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4673233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electricity Load Forecasting Using Rough Set Attribute Reduction Algorithm Based on Immune Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10389258","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4673233/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electricity Load Forecasting Using Rough Set Attribute Reduction Algorithm Based on Immune Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3402a239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107794S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4673182","isNumber":"4673183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4673182","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4673183","articleId":"4673233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4673234,"authors":[{"name":"Jinying Li","affiliation":["Department of Economy and Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Jinying","lastName":"Li","id":"37715749400"},{"name":"Yuzhi Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Economy and Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37877960900"},{"name":"Jinchao Li","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinchao","lastName":"Li","id":"37558863800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3402-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4673234","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4673234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Electrical safety","Power systems","Set theory","Risk management","Power system management","Data mining","Research and development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical safety","neural nets","power grids","power system analysis computing","power system faults","rough set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power grid safety evaluation","rough set neural network","artificial neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power grid safety","rough set","artificial neural network (ANN)","evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRMEM.2008.35","pdfPath":"/iel5/4673182/4673183/04673234.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Risk Management & Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Risk Management & Engineering Management","startPage":"245","endPage":"249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4673183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRMEM.2008.35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Grid Safety Evaluation Based on Rough Set Neural Network","abstract":"With the continuous deepening of the power system reform and the blackouts of someplace on the world, the safety of the power grid has received high attention from all sections of the society.

And the high returns and high risks would coexist in this industry. First, this paper established the real estate portfolio model based on information entropy, with the smallest risk as the greatest benefits. In addition, this paper developed a new algorithm to find the optimal real estate portfolio to achieve the smallest risk as the greatest benefits. And the proposed algorithm modified a population-based search procedure, particle swarm optimization, by adopting an elite archiving scheme to store nondominated solutions and by aptly using members of the archive to direct further search. Moreover, the termination of the proposed algorithm was set to that no new members have entered into the elite archive. In addition, through a practical case, the proposed algorithm is shown effective and efficient in real estate portfolio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4673304/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10389310","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4673304/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Elitist Particle Swarm Optimization to Facilitate Real Estate Portfolio Based on Information Entropy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Elitist Particle Swarm Optimization to Facilitate Real Estate Portfolio Based on Information Entropy","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3402a633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048667S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4673182","isNumber":"4673183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4673182","xplore-issue":"4673183","articleId":"4673304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4673346,"authors":[{"name":"Aldis Baums","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Latvia"],"firstName":"Aldis","lastName":"Baums","id":"37871689600"},{"name":"Uldis Grunde","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Latvia"],"firstName":"Uldis","lastName":"Grunde","id":"37871687800"},{"name":"Modris Greitans","affiliation":["Digital Signal Processing Laboratory, Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Latvia"],"firstName":"Modris","lastName":"Greitans","id":"37568146100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-88309-47-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-88309-52-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4673346","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4673346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Microprocessors","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Energy consumption","Digital signal processing","Data processing","Control systems","Clocks","Dynamic voltage scaling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","microcomputers","microcontrollers","signal sampling","Texas Instruments computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["level-crossing sampling","microprocessor","Texas Instruments","MSP430 micro-controllers","asynchronous data processing system","nonstationary signal sampling","nonstationary signal processing","digital signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["level-crossing sampling","microprocessor system","power consumption control"]}],"abstract":"The development of an asynchronous data processing system is usually based on dedicated asynchronous elements.

Power saving can be achieved by correlating the system computational activity with the input signal variations. In this context an adaptive rate filtering technique, based on the level crossing sampling is devised. It can adapt the sampling rate and so the processing activity by following the input signal local variations. Interpolation is required in the proposed technique. A drastic reduction in the interpolation error is achieved by employing the symmetry during the interpolation process. The computational complexity of the proposed filtering technique is deduced and compared to the classical one. Results promise a significant computational gain.

comparison of two transmission schemes that have been proposed for the power line communications and exploit a standard Fourier transform and a circular sine/cosine-modulated filter bank modulator. The first transmission scenario is well-known as OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) and DMT (discrete multitone) while the second scheme is similar to DWMT (discrete wavelet multitone), also known as wavelet-OFDM, that makes use of CMFBs (cosine-modulated filter banks). In contrary to the wavelet-OFDM the proposed modulator is circular and makes use of a cyclic prefix what makes the channel equalization and transmission synchronization very simple. Because it utilizes wavelet-like real-value sine/cosine carriers modulated in amplitude by a specially designed window, it can be called a circular wavelet-OFDM due to its similarity to the wavelet-OFDM. In the paper BER characteristics are presented for both OFDM and circular wavelet-OFDM modulators for impulsive disturbances and better performance of the second scheme is pointed out.","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2008.4673455","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667705/4673327/04673455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2008.4673455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4673327","startPage":"423","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of uncoded/coded windowed-OFDM and circular wavelet-OFDM transmission in PLC channel with bit-loading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4673455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of uncoded/coded windowed-OFDM and circular wavelet-OFDM transmission in PLC channel with bit-loading","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4673455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389035","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4673455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of uncoded/coded windowed-OFDM and circular wavelet-OFDM transmission in PLC channel with bit-loading","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SPI-11082008-00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060509S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667705","isNumber":"4673327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667705","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4673327","articleId":"4673455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AGH UST, DEPARTMENT OFIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4673492,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Golonek","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Golonek","id":"37299177700"},{"name":"Damian Grzechca","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Grzechca","id":"37283749100"},{"name":"Jerzy Rutkowski","affiliation":["Politechnika Slaska, Gliwice, PL"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rutkowski","id":"37283749800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-88309-47-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-88309-52-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4673492","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4673492","abstract":"The method presented in this paper uses evolutionary computations to analog circuit testing stimulus shape optimization.

In this paper, we proposed a scheme that not only thwarts all kinds of attacks such as vector quantization (VQ) and oracle attack in order to satisfy the security but also ensures superior accuracy of tamper localization. It is effective because the detection is based on a hierarchical structure so that the accuracy of tamper localization can be ensured. That is, if a tampered pixel is not detected in level-4, it will be detected in level 3, level 2 or level 1 with a probability of nearly 1. The method can detect any tampered pixel and the size of 2times2 pixel block with a missing rate less than 0.78% and 0.19% respectively, and the missing rate of more than or equal the size of 4times4 pixel block is approximately close to 0.

DGNN is based on the Hebbian learning rule and adds new neurons under certain conditions. When DGNN performs supervised learning, resonance will happen if the winner can't match the training example; this rule combines the ART/ARTMAP neural network and WTA learning rule. When DGNN performs unsupervised learning, post-prune is carried out to prevent overfitting the training data just like decision tree learning. The intrusion detection method is an anomaly detection method and the feature is selected from the packets.

While prior protocol designs alleviated such starvation by utilizing MIMO, they require global synchronization to temporally align transmissions and require per-packet distribution of the complete channel state information. In this paper, we experimentally show that MIMO networks based on pre-802.11 n medium access, the state-of-the-art for asynchronous MIMO CSMA, worsen starvation as compared to SISO networks. Consequently, we design an asynchronous MIMO MAC protocol that counters starvation. We show that randomized and non-greedy antenna allocation coupled with local residual capacity estimation results in previously-starving nodes capturing a fair share of system resources while simultaneously exploiting throughput gains available to multi-antenna systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.39","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674159/4674160/04674199.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Randomized Antenna Allocation in Asynchronous MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674199/","displayDocTitle":"Fair Randomized Antenna Allocation in Asynchronous MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10311921","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674199/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Randomized Antenna Allocation in Asynchronous MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"01-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.171248S","chronDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674159","isNumber":"4674160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674159","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4674160","articleId":"4674199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4674202,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li","id":"37539516400"},{"name":"Wei Shu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shu","id":"37279918100"},{"name":"Minglu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minglu","lastName":"Li","id":"37278835500"},{"name":"Pei-En Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Pei-En","lastName":"Luo","id":"37685166800"},{"name":"Hongyu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534002900"},{"name":"Min-You Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Min-You","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277237800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2390-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4674202","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Data processing","Sampling methods","Roads","Monitoring","Costs","Cities and towns","Intelligent sensors","Testing","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic information systems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic data processing","vehicular sensor networks","taxi companies","traffic monitoring","network congestion avoidance","large-scale testing"]}],"abstract":"The existing vehicular sensors of taxi companies in most of cities can be used for traffic monitoring, however sensors are always set with a long sampling interval because of communication cost saving and network congestion avoidance.

However, when multiple secondary users compete for a limited amount of spectrum, quality of service (QoS) for these users could degrade due to interference. In this paper, we present an integrated modeling and forecasting framework characterizing spectrum use by secondary users in a cognitive radio network (CRN). In our proposed method, each secondary user in a CRN, first enters a learning and modeling phase where it attempts to estimate the traffic parameters of other secondary users. Following this phase, the secondary user actively participates in opportunistic spectrum use. Assuming a continuous time Markov chain model for secondary user activity, we develop a Kalman filter based approach for estimating the number of secondary users. This estimate is in turn used to predict the number of secondary users in a future time instant. Experimental results show that our proposed forecasting technique provides a good upper bound prediction for the number of secondary users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674210/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10323508","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674210/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Forecasting Secondary User Activity in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Forecasting Secondary User Activity in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"01-08-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149978S","chronDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674159","isNumber":"4674160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674159","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4674160","articleId":"4674210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4674223,"authors":[{"name":"Shashank Shanbhag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shashank","lastName":"Shanbhag","id":"37392281300"},{"name":"Tilman Wolf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tilman","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37281966000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2390-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4674223","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Telecommunication traffic","Signal processing algorithms","Monitoring","Prototypes","Real time systems","Electric variables measurement","Predictive models","Frequency","Floods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","security of data","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massively parallel anomaly detection","online network measurement","network management","network security","high-performance embedded processing systems","traffic monitoring","aggregation process","anomaly tree representation"]}],"abstract":"Detecting anomalies during the operation of a network is an important aspect of network management and security. Recent development of high-performance embedded processing systems allow traffic monitoring and anomaly detection in real-time. In this paper, we show how such processing capabilities can be used to run several different anomaly detection algorithms in parallel on thousands of different traffic subclasses. The main challenge in this context is to manage and aggregate the vast amount of data generated by these processes. We propose (1) a novel aggregation process that uses continuous anomaly information (rather than binary outputs) from existing algorithms and (2) an anomaly tree representation to illustrate the state of all traffic subclasses. Aggregated anomaly detection results show a lower false positive and false negative rate than any single anomaly detection algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.63","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674159/4674160/04674223.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massively Parallel Anomaly Detection in Online Network Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674223/","displayDocTitle":"Massively Parallel Anomaly Detection in Online Network Measurement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10323518","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674223/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massively Parallel Anomaly Detection in Online Network Measurement","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"01-12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075419S","chronDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674159","isNumber":"4674160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674159","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4674160","articleId":"4674223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4674232,"authors":[{"name":"Alice Yen-Chi Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alice Yen-Chi","lastName":"Peng","id":"37672551000"},{"name":"Shahram Yousefi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Yousefi","id":"37274288500"},{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278943200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2390-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4674232","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674232","abstract":"The maximum-likelihood (ML)-detected vertical bell-labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) architecture over a Nakagami-m fading channel is considered.

This is usually done by adding gateways which serve to increase the backhaul capacity of the network. In this paper we study the problem of this type of capacity augmentation using free-space optical (FSO) backhaul links. A joint clustering and gateway placement problem is formulated which includes the strong rate-distance dependence of practical FSO links. The formulation incorporates the positions of existing wireline gateways and minimizes the number of additional hybrid-FSO/RF gateways which are needed to satisfy the new target capacity requirements. A genetic algorithm solution is proposed, and the performance of our algorithm is compared to an optimal solution generated using an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. Various scenarios are considered which demonstrate the value of using FSO backhaul links to obtain post-deployment capacity upgrades in response to evolving user traffic.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.80","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674159/4674160/04674240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674160","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gateway Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks Using Free Space Optical Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gateway Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks Using Free Space Optical Links","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10323531","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gateway Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks Using Free Space Optical Links","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-05-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095197S","chronDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674159","isNumber":"4674160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674159","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4674160","articleId":"4674240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674260,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Cavalcanti","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Department, Philips Research North America, Briarcliff, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Cavalcanti","id":"37300543400"},{"name":"Sushanta Das","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Department, Philips Research North America, Briarcliff, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sushanta","lastName":"Das","id":"37278511800"},{"name":"Jianfeng Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Department, Philips Research North America, Briarcliff, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524100"},{"name":"Kiran Challapali","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Department, Philips Research North America, Briarcliff, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Challapali","id":"37283381200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2390-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4674260","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1988},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks","Chromium","ZigBee","Protocols","Costs","Frequency","Automation","Routing","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","wireless sensor networks","dynamic spectrum access","ZigBee"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.100","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674159/4674160/04674260.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Networks","abstract":"In recent years, we have seen tremendous growth in the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in unlicensed spectrum bands.

In this paper we present a conceptual design of CR-based WSNs, identify the main advantages and challenges of using CR technology, and suggest possible remedies to overcome the challenges. As an illustration, we study the performance of CR-based WSN used for the automation and control applications in residential and commercial premises.

The low computational complexity reduces the detection time and improves the radio agility. In this paper, we present a framework to analyze the performance of this covariance-based method.

Unfortunately, while multi-user detection often allows higher data rates, it greatly complicates the problem: in addition to choosing a transmit covariance for each transmitter, we must decide which signals each receiver will detect and which data rates make such detection feasible. We discuss methods to optimize the data rates in two ways: maximizing the sum throughput of the network, and choosing rates based on the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution from cooperative game theory. Simulation results suggest that, while sum-rate maximization yields higher average throughput, the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution provides a superior solution in terms of fairness.

We propose an adaptive connectivity aware routing (ACAR) protocol that addresses these problems by adaptively selecting an optimal route with the best network transmission quality based on the statistical and realtime density data that are gathered through an on-the-fly density collection process. The protocol consists of two parts: (1) select an optimal route, consisting of road segments, with the best estimated transmission quality (2) in each road segment in the selected route, select the most efficient multi-hop path that will improve delivery ratio and throughput. The optimal route can be selected using our new connectivity model that takes into account vehicles densities and traffic light periods to estimate transmission quality at road segments, which considers the probability of connectivity and data delivery ratio for transmitting packets. In each road segment along the optimal path, each hop is selected to minimize the packet error rate of the entire path. Our simulation results show that the proposed ACAR protocol outperforms existing VANET routing protocols in terms of data delivery ratio, throughput and data packet delay. In addition, ACAR works very well even if accurate statistical data is not available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10323550","htmlLink":"/document/4674267/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"ACAR: Adaptive Connectivity Aware Routing Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACAR: Adaptive Connectivity Aware Routing Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"03-02-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065505S","chronDate":"3-7 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674159","isNumber":"4674160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674159","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4674160","articleId":"4674267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4674283,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Djalaliev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Djalaliev","id":"37869795000"},{"name":"Muhammad Jamshed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Jamshed","id":"37085687735"},{"name":"Nicholas Farnan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Farnan","id":"37869792500"},{"name":"Jose Brustoloni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Brustoloni","id":"37280092200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2390-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4674283","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"Effective defenses against DDoS attacks that deplete resources at the network and transport layers have been deployed commercially. Therefore, DDoS attacks increasingly use normal- looking application-layer requests to waste server CPU or disk capacity. CAPTCHAs attempt to distinguish bots from human clients and are often used to avoid such attacks. However, CAPTCHAs themselves consume resources and frequently are defeated. Kill-Bots reduces CAPTCHA overhead by pushing client authentication into the kernel. However, Kill-Bots requires kernel modifications, which can be infeasible. We describe the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Sentinel, a network device that overcomes several limitations in Kill-Bots. Sentinel can be easily deployed as a bridge in front of server farms, modularly accepts a variety of present and future authentication schemes, and can use network processors to accelerate authentication.

This is intended mainly to provide a robust reliable framework for financial applications that are often subject to legal requirements concerning rounding and precision of the results, because the binary floating-point arithmetic may introduce small but unacceptable errors. Using binary floating-point calculations to emulate decimal calculations in order to correct this issue has led to the existence of numerous proprietary software packages, each with its own characteristics and capabilities. The IEEE 754R decimal arithmetic should unify the ways decimal floating-point calculations are carried out on various platforms. New algorithms and properties are presented in this paper, which are used in a software implementation of the IEEE 754R decimal floating-point arithmetic, with emphasis on using binary operations efficiently. The focus is on rounding techniques for decimal values stored in binary format, but algorithms are outlined for the more important or interesting operations of addition, multiplication, and division, including the case of nonhomogeneous operands, as well as conversions between binary and decimal floating-point formats. Performance results are included for a wider range of operations, showing promise that our approach is viable for applications that require decimal floating-point calculations.

Our measurements show that power-up of SRAM produces a physical fingerprint. We propose a system of fingerprint extraction and random numbers in SRAM (FERNS) that harvests static identity and randomness from existing volatile CMOS memory without requiring any dedicated circuitry. The identity results from manufacture-time physically random device threshold voltage mismatch, and the random numbers result from runtime physically random noise. We use experimental data from high-performance SRAM chips and the embedded SRAM of the WISP UHF RFID tag to validate the principles behind FERNS. For the SRAM chip, we demonstrate that 8-byte fingerprints can uniquely identify circuits among a population of 5,120 instances and extrapolate that 24-byte fingerprints would uniquely identify all instances ever produced. Using a smaller population, we demonstrate similar identifying ability from the embedded SRAM. In addition to identification, we show that SRAM fingerprints capture noise, enabling true random number generation. We demonstrate that a 512-byte SRAM fingerprint contains sufficient entropy to generate 128-bit true random numbers and that the generated numbers pass the NIST tests for runs, approximate entropy, and block frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802319","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4674345/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power-Up SRAM State as an Identifying Fingerprint and Source of True Random Numbers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Up SRAM State as an Identifying Fingerprint and Source of True Random Numbers","sourcePdf":"ttc2009091198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089807S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5176044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"468","xplore-issue":"5176044","articleId":"4674345","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4674354,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5090555/4674354/4674354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dusit Niyato received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Canada, in 2008.

The primary users or primary service providers can adjust their behavior in selling the spectrum opportunities to secondary users to achieve the highest utility. In this paper, we model the evolution and the dynamic behavior of secondary users using the theory of evolutionary game. An algorithm for the implementation of the evolution process of a secondary user is also presented. To model the competition among the primary users, a noncooperative game is formulated where the Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution (in terms of size of offered spectrum to the secondary users and spectrum price). For a primary user, an iterative algorithm for strategy adaptation to achieve the solution is presented. The proposed game-theoretic framework for modeling the interactions among multiple primary users (or service providers) and multiple secondary users is used to investigate network dynamics under different system parameter settings and under system perturbation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.157","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5090555/04674354.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of Multiple-Seller and Multiple-Buyer Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretic Modeling Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Multiple-Seller and Multiple-Buyer Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretic Modeling Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10721295","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4674354/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Multiple-Seller and Multiple-Buyer Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretic Modeling Approach","sourcePdf":"ttm2009081009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078566S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5090555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"276","xplore-issue":"5090555","articleId":"4674354","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674368,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Rosten","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5339303/4674368/4674368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edward Rosten received the MEng degree from Oxford in 2002 and the PhD degree from Cambridge in 2006.

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.275","startPage":"105","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5339303/04674368.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster and Better: A Machine Learning Approach to Corner Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Faster and Better: A Machine Learning Approach to Corner Detection","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985550","pubMedId":"19926902","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4674368/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster and Better: A Machine Learning Approach to Corner Detection","sourcePdf":"ttp2010010105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190049S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5339303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1051","xplore-issue":"5339303","articleId":"4674368","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4674396,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, we focus on the usage of the sampling technique for simulation acceleration, in the case of design space exploration (DSE), considering MPSoC. Among the addressed issue is the formation of sampling intervals that are executed simultaneously by the different processors.

Both harmonic tuning and load modulation are based on an accurate large-signal model extracted for the GaN devices. Two devices of identical size are used. In previous research works, the use of load modulation on two identical size devices always results in decreases in output power, gain, or even linearity, although improvements in efficiency are shown. Besides that, the influence of the offset line on linearity is not covered. In this experiment, by optimizing the load modulation and properly designing the offset line, a power added efficiency (PAE) of 65%, a linear gain of 16 dB, and an output power of 40.5 dBm have been achieved at 2 GHz. Compared with those of a balanced power amplifier, the load modulated PA shows superior power performance both in efficiency (more than 10% improvement in PAE) and in linearity. Moreover, its output power and gain maintain as high as that of the balanced PA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674474/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10323606","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency Enhancement of Harmonic-Tuned GaN Power Amplifier Using Doherty like Load Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency Enhancement of Harmonic-Tuned GaN Power Amplifier Using Doherty like Load Modulation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047455S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674454","isNumber":"4674455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674454","xplore-issue":"4674455","articleId":"4674474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674475,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Bagger","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Wide Band Radio, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Bagger","id":"37695816000"},{"name":"H\u00e5kan Olsson","affiliation":["Radio Electronics ECS/ICT, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"H\u00e5kan","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37265061400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1940-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1939-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-8781"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"}],"articleNumber":"4674475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Temperature","Linearity","Broadband amplifiers","Degradation","High power amplifiers","Application specific integrated circuits","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power integrated circuits","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF power amplifier IC","low memory effect","reduced low frequency gain peak","isolated temperature tracking circuitry","LDMOS process technology","gain 28.5 dB","power 5 W"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674475","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2008.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2008.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674455","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674454/4674455/04674475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF Power Amplifier IC with Low Memory Effect, Reduced Low Frequency Gain Peak and Isolated Temperature Tracking Circuitry","abstract":"A highly linear wideband power amplifier IC with low memory effect for W-CDMA applications is presented utilizing Si LDMOS process technology. The IC was optimized to reduce typical low frequency gain peak often observed in LDMOS power devices. Topology of the interstage matching contributes to reduction of the electrical memory effect to specification level of maximum 2 dB imbalance over power between upper and lower Adjacent Channel Power Ratio when using II-tone wideband modulated signal. The on-chip temperature compensation circuitry tracks the active device temperature characteristic without degradation of the linearity or worsens the memory effect. The measured gain of the IC was 28.5 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 600 MHz around 2100 MHz was achieved. The IC attained -50 dBc ACPR at 5 W output power. At power level of 45 W and IMD3 = -30 dBc (two-tone) the IC exhibited power densities in excess of 469 mW/mm, in which matching losses were included. The IC demonstrated state-of-the-art RF power performance in terms of good linearity, low memory effects, well-suppressed low frequency gain peak and temperature tracking without linearity and IMD balance degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674475/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10323607","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"RF Power Amplifier IC with Low Memory Effect, Reduced Low Frequency Gain Peak and Isolated Temperature Tracking Circuitry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Power Amplifier IC with Low Memory Effect, Reduced Low Frequency Gain Peak and Isolated Temperature Tracking Circuitry","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042442S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674454","isNumber":"4674455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674454","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4674455","articleId":"4674475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674483,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For a low-noise amplifier (LNA), a simple noise model is employed to facilitate efficient design in the millimeter- wave range. For a power amplifier (PA), a reliability issue due to degradation of hot carrier injection should be carefully considered for large-signal operation. To maximize output power while ensuring sufficient lifetime, we have established PA design process including co-simulation technique. The developed LNA achieves a noise figure of 5.7 dB with 13-dB gain at 63 GHz. On the other hand, PA exhibits a saturated output power of 8.5 dBm with 15.2-dB linear gain at 60 GHz with a supply voltage as low as 0.7 V where sufficient lifetime is expected. Finally, transmitter and receiver front-end circuits are demonstrated for 2.6-Gbps QPSK operation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","MMICs","Wireless personal area networks","Millimeter wave technology","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Gain","Standards development","Low-noise amplifiers","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MMIC amplifiers","personal area networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS MMIC technology","high-speed wireless personal area networks","low-noise amplifier","power amplifier","QPSK operation","bandwidth 60 GHz","noise figure 5.7 dB","gain 13 dB","frequency 63 GHz","gain 15.2 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2008.49","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674454/4674455/04674504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2008.49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60-GHz-Band CMOS MMIC Technology for High-Speed Wireless Personal Area Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"60-GHz-Band CMOS MMIC Technology for High-Speed Wireless Personal Area Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674504/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674504/","accessionNumber":"10323625","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60-GHz-Band CMOS MMIC Technology for High-Speed Wireless Personal Area Networks","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"L1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073635S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674454","isNumber":"4674455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674454","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4674455","articleId":"4674504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674505,"authors":[{"name":"Daeik D.

The backbone of the methodology is an electromagnetic model for the on-chip portion of the power grid. This allows for the impact of the displacement current density and, hence, electromagnetic retardation, to be taken into account in the accurate modeling of the power grid behavior at picosecond switching speeds. In this manner, and through the interfacing of this model with an electromagnetic model for the package portion of the power grid, which is described in terms of a multiport rational matrix transfer function, the impact of package-chip electrical interactions on switching noise can be modeled with electromagnetic accuracy. The electromagnetic model for the power grid is complemented by a resistance-capacitance model for the semiconductor substrate, which is capable of modeling local substrate induced noise coupling between neighboring circuits. Finally, distributed resistance, inductance, capacitance and conductance circuits for signal wires are extracted and used to provide for a transmission line-based modeling of crosstalk and power grid induced signal degradation. Transient simulations using the proposed comprehensive model are carried out using a hybrid time-domain integration scheme which combines a SPICE-like engine for the analysis of all circuit netlists and the nonlinear drivers incorporated in the model with a numerical integration algorithm suitable for the expedient update of the state variables in the discrete electromagnetic model for the power grid.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2008.2005013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","startPage":"841","endPage":"854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4674527/04674536.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2008.2005013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Electromagnetic Modeling of On-Chip Switching Noise Generation and Coupling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic modeling","Electromagnetic interference","Noise generators","Electromagnetic coupling","Power grids","Crosstalk","Semiconductor device noise","Semiconductor device packaging","Circuit noise","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power grids","SPICE","switching","time-domain analysis","transfer function matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete electromagnetic model","onchip switching noise generation","power switching","power grid","displacement current density","electromagnetic retardation","multiport rational matrix transfer function","resistance-capacitance model","hybrid time-domain integration scheme","SPICE-like engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain/simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (FDTD/SPICE) hybrid transient simulation","on-chip power grid switching","power grid common-impedance coupling","substrate noise coupling","switching noise analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Electromagnetic Modeling of On-Chip Switching Noise Generation and Coupling","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10348143","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674536/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674536/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Electromagnetic Modeling of On-Chip Switching Noise Generation and Coupling","sourcePdf":"31tadvp04-ichung-2005013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098642S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4674527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4674527","articleId":"4674536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674539,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Dangel","affiliation":["Zurich Research Laboratory, IBM Research GmbH, Rueschlikon, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4674527/4674539/4674539-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roger Dangel received the diploma (cum laude) in physics and the Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ), Switzerland, in 1991 and 1997, respectively.

Also, in BPM, major sources of media noise are the fluctuations in the location of the magnetic islands and fluctuations in the sizes of the magnetic islands. The location fluctuations can happen in both along-the-track and in cross-track directions. The size fluctuations affect both ISI and ITI. In order to obtain a more realistic channel model that includes the 2-D interference and the 2-D impact of media noise, we have developed a 2-D pulse response simulator for BPM.

Simulation results show that to achieve an acceptable bit error rate (BER), the location and size fluctuations should be smaller than 8% of the bit period at a density of 1.5 Tb/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n .","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04674587.pdf","startPage":"3789","endPage":"3792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Pulse Response and Media Noise Modeling for Bit-Patterned Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674587/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Pulse Response and Media Noise Modeling for Bit-Patterned Media","volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10361938","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674587/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Pulse Response and Media Noise Modeling for Bit-Patterned Media","sourcePdf":"tmag-nabavi-2002387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059793S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4674587","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674592,"authors":[{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Hefei Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4686035/4674592/4674592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["De-Shuang Huang (SM'98) received the B.Sc. degree from the Institute of Electronic Engineering, Hefei, China, in 1986, the M.Sc. degree from National Defense University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 1993, all in electronic engineering.","During 1993\u20131997, he was a Postdoctoral Student at the Beijing Institute of Technology and the National Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, respectively.

The proposed algorithms are evaluated through eight benchmark classification problems and two real-world application problems, a plant species identification task involving 50 plant species and a palmprint recognition task. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is feasible and efficient for the structure optimization of the RBPNN. The RBPNN achieves higher recognition rates and better classification efficiency than multilayer perceptron networks (MLPNs) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) in both tasks.

In this paper, an efficient object recognition method using boundary representation and the wavelet neural network is proposed. The method employs a wavelet neural network (WNN) to characterize the singularities of the object curvature representation and to perform the object classification at the same time and in an automatic way. The local time\u2013frequency attributes of the singularities on the object boundary are detected by making a preliminary wavelet analysis of the curvature representation. Then, the discriminative scale\u2013translation features of the singularities are stored as the initial scale\u2013translation parameters of the wavelet nodes in the WNN. These parameters are trained to their optimum status during the learning stage. With our approach, as opposed to matching features by convolving the signal with wavelet functions at a large number of scales, the computational burden is significantly reduced. Only a few convolutions are performed at the optimum scale\u2013translation grids during the classification, which makes it suitable for real-time recognition tasks.

Furthermore, the effect of choosing different sampling start times on both the bias and the variance is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674598/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10647783","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Windowing on Bias and Variance of DFT-Based Frequency and Phase Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Windowing on Bias and Variance of DFT-Based Frequency and Phase Estimation","sourcePdf":"tim-schuster-2006131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079762S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4919430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4919430","articleId":"4674598","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674603,"authors":[{"name":"Przemyslaw Pawelczak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4674603/4674603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Przemys\u0142aw Pawe\u0142czak (S'01) received the M.Sc.

The analysis is based on a discrete Markov chain model of a subset of representative multichannel OSA MAC classes that incorporates physical layer effects, such as spectrum sensing and fading. The analysis is complemented with extensive simulations. The major observations are given as follows: 1) When the CC is implemented through a dedicated channel, sharing such dedicated channel with the licensed user does not significantly decrease the throughput achieved by the OSA network when the data packet sizes are sufficiently large or the number of considered data channels is small. 2) Hopping OSA MACs, where the CC is spread over all channels, are less susceptible to licensed user activity than those with a dedicated CC (in terms of both average utilization and on/off times). 3) Scanning efficiency has a large impact on the achievable performance of licensed and OSA users for all analyzed protocols. 4) The multiple rendezvous MAC class, which has yet to be proposed in OSA literature, outperforms all the multichannel MAC designs analyzed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","volume":"58","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10712968","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674603/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multichannel Medium Access Control Algorithms for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multichannel Medium Access Control Algorithms for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"tvt-pawelczak-2009350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1144S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4674603","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4674605,"authors":[{"name":"Lingfan Weng","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4674605/4674605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingfan Weng received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2008.","He is currently with Macquarie Asia Limited."]},"firstName":"Lingfan","lastName":"Weng","id":"37692322100"},{"name":"Ross D.

In this paper, we investigate cooperation strategies and resource-allocation algorithms for multiuser cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) systems. There are two major contributions of this paper. First, we propose a novel cooperation strategy for the OFDMA system. When there are two users in the system, the strategy achieves the capacity region upper bound for decode-and-forward (DF) cooperation. When there are multiple users in the system, the strategy can achieve near upper-bound performance in certain network topologies. Moreover, the strategy always outperforms those that are previously proposed for cooperative OFDMA systems. The second contribution is that we develop novel centralized resource-allocation algorithms for cooperative OFDMA systems. The advantages of the algorithms are that they not only simultaneously solve relay, power, and subcarrier allocation but also have complexity that increases only linearly with the number of subcarriers in the systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperation Strategies and Resource Allocations in Multiuser OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2009060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04674605.pdf","startPage":"2331","endPage":"2342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2009060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation Strategies and Resource Allocations in Multiuser OFDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4674605/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10630443","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation Strategies and Resource Allocations in Multiuser OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-weng-2009060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07549S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4674605","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4674606,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.L.

These attributes accord for increased appeal in employing the EDLCs as energy-storage devices in renewable energy systems, industrial applications, and hybrid electric vehicles as compared to other mature static energy-storage devices. This paper describes the construction of a 320-V, 12-F EDLC energy-storage bank connected to a bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter. Two types of EDLC bank configurations are considered with emphasis on their voltage-balancing circuits. Subsequently, this paper proposes a voltage-balancing circuit based on a center-tapped transformer, and includes its experimental verifications. It also discusses the charge-discharge and self-starting operation of the EDLC energy-storage system. During the charge-discharge operation, a low ripple current flowing in the EDLC bank is observed, leading to a theoretical analysis. The EDLC bank is also successfully charged to its rated voltage without any external dc charging circuit.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04674606.pdf","startPage":"2755","endPage":"2765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage Balancing of a 320-V, 12-F Electric Double-Layer Capacitor Bank Combined With a 10-kW Bidirectional Isolated DC--DC Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Voltage Balancing of a 320-V, 12-F Electric Double-Layer Capacitor Bank Combined With a 10-kW Bidirectional Isolated DC--DC Converter","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370064","htmlLink":"/document/4674606/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage Balancing of a 320-V, 12-F Electric Double-Layer Capacitor Bank Combined With a 10-kW Bidirectional Isolated DC--DC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-tan-2005388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103067S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4674606","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674613,"authors":[{"name":"Francesca Bovolo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Bovolo","id":"37294415900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4674613","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a novel parcel-based context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection in very high geometrical resolution images. In order to improve pixel-based change-detection performance, we propose to exploit the spatial-context information in the framework of a multilevel approach. The proposed technique models the scene (and hence changes) at different resolution levels defining multitemporal and multilevel ldquoparcelsrdquo (i.e., small homogeneous regions shared by both original images). Change detection is achieved by applying a multilevel change vector analysis to each pixel of the considered images. This technique properly analyzes the multilevel and multitemporal parcel-based context information of the considered spatial position. The adaptive nature of multitemporal parcels and their multilevel representation allow one a proper modeling of complex objects in the investigated scene as well as borders and details of the changed areas. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4747356/04674613.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2007429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2007429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multilevel Parcel-Based Approach to Change Detection in Very High Resolution Multitemporal Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Spatial resolution","Image analysis","Layout","Pixel","Information analysis","Context modeling","Image representation","Remote sensing","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","image representation","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very high resolution multitemporal images","parcel-based context-sensitive technique","unsupervised change detection","multilevel change vector analysis","multitemporal parcels","multilevel image representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change detection","multilevel image representation","multitemporal image analysis","very high resolution (VHR) images"]},{"kwd":["Change detection","multilevel image representation","multitemporal image analysis","very high resolution (VHR) images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Multilevel Parcel-Based Approach to Change Detection in Very High Resolution Multitemporal Images","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4674613/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10371112","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multilevel Parcel-Based Approach to Change Detection in Very High Resolution Multitemporal Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-bovolo-2007429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106577S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4747356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4747356","articleId":"4674613","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4674617,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Wang","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4674617/4674617-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuo Wang (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906\u2013SM\u201907) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 1994, the M.S.E.E. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2005.","Since 2005, he has been a Research Assistant Professor at the Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Tech.

Optical images at different resolutions and radar images represent useful tools for this application, particularly when more frequent revisit times will be available with the implementation of new missions and future possible constellations of satellites. Very high resolution (VHR) images (on the order of 1 m or less) may provide information at the scale of a single building, whereas images at resolutions on the order of tens of meters may give indications of damage levels at a district scale. Both types of information may be extremely important if provided with sufficient timeliness to rescue teams. The earthquake that hit the city of Bam, Iran, has been taken as a test case, where QuickBird VHR optical images and advanced synthetic aperture radar data were available both before and after the event. Methods to process these data in order to detect damage and to extract features used to estimate damage levels are investigated in this paper, pointing out the significant potential of these satellite data and their possible synergy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370908","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4674629/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploiting SAR and VHR Optical Images to Quantify Damage Caused by the 2003 Bam Earthquake","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting SAR and VHR Optical Images to Quantify Damage Caused by the 2003 Bam Earthquake","sourcePdf":"tgrs-chini-2002695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053794S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4729684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4729684","articleId":"4674629","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4674631,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Xu","affiliation":["COBRA Research Institute, Technical University Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Xu","id":"37879410700"},{"name":"Mahmoud Nikoufard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Nikoufard","id":"37869663300"},{"name":"Xaveer J.

It is testified that the gain saturation is more easily achieved for lower signal-to-pump ratio (SPR), and the NF is reduced at higher pump level when below Brillouin threshold. The experiment demonstrated that up to 20-ns delay enhancement could be obtained in this high-power FBA for a -30-dBm input signal, as well as with low NF.

Chaotic dynamics and synchronization are obtained by current injection into the laser pair of a common, chaotic driving-signal. Results of simulations are reported for the configuration in which the chaotic driving-current is obtained by photodetection of the emission of a third laser (driver), chaotic by delayed optical feedback in a short cavity scheme, selected with different parameters with respect to the laser pair. The emissions of the synchronized, matched lasers are highly correlated, whereas their correlation with the driver is low. The digital message modulates the pumping current of the transmitter. Message recovery is performed by subtracting the chaos, locally generated by the synchronized receiver laser, from the signal obtained by photodetection (at the receiver side) of the chaos-masked message transmitted in free space. Simulations have been performed with the Lang-Kobayashi model, keeping into account both attenuation of the optical signal in a line-of-sight configuration, and noise. Security has been investigated and demonstrated by considering the effect, on synchronization and message recovery, of the parameter mismatch between transmitter and receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Chaotic Transmission on a Free-Space Optics Data Link","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2008.2001929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4655531/04674656.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2008.2001929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4655531","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Secure Chaotic Transmission on a Free-Space Optics Data Link","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4674656/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312382","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Chaotic Transmission on a Free-Space Optics Data Link","sourcePdf":"44jqe11-smerlo-2001929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10198S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4655531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4655531","articleId":"4674656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4674657,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas J.

This treatment gives considerable insight into the potential of a monolithic version of the circuit for optical communication functions including clock recovery and chaotic source applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4674633/04674657.pdf","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2008.2000924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2008.2000924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Li\u00c9nard Oscillator Resonant Tunnelling Diode-Laser Diode Hybrid Integrated Circuit: Model and Experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant tunneling devices","Hybrid integrated circuits","Integrated circuit modeling","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Differential equations","Optical fiber communication","Nonlinear equations","Photonic integrated circuits","Diode lasers","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","integrated optoelectronics","nonlinear differential equations","optical fibre communication","resonant tunnelling diodes","semiconductor lasers","synchronisation","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid optoelectronic integrated circuit","resonant tunnelling diode","laser diode","voltage controlled oscillator","Lienard equation","second order nonlinear differential equation","Van der Pol equation","optical fiber communication functions","clock recovery applications","chaotic source applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver circuits","integrated optoelectronics","nonlinear systems","optical fiber communication","oscillators","resonant tunneling diodes","semiconductor lasers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Li\u00c9nard Oscillator Resonant Tunnelling Diode-Laser Diode Hybrid Integrated Circuit: Model and Experiment","volume":"44","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4674657/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312396","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Li\u00c9nard Oscillator Resonant Tunnelling Diode-Laser Diode Hybrid Integrated Circuit: Model and Experiment","sourcePdf":"44jqe10-tslight-2000924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059605S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4674633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4674633","articleId":"4674657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4674673,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4674673/4674673-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beibei Wang (S'07) received her B.S. degree in electrical engineering (with highest honor) from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in July 2004.

In a dynamically changing spectrum environment, it is very important to consider the statistics of different users' spectrum access so as to achieve more efficient spectrum allocation. In this paper, we propose a primary-prioritized Markov approach for dynamic spectrum access through modeling the interactions between the primary and the secondary users as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC). Based on the CTMC models, to compensate the throughput degradation due to the interference among secondary users, we derive the optimal access probabilities for the secondary users, by which the spectrum access of the secondary users is optimally coordinated, and the spectrum dynamics are clearly captured. Therefore, a good tradeoff can be achieved between the spectrum efficiency and fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed primary-prioritized dynamic spectrum access approach under proportional fairness criterion achieves much higher throughput than the CSMA-based random access approaches and the approach achieving max-min fairness. Moreover, it provides fair spectrum sharing among secondary users with only small performance degradation compared to the approach maximizing the overall average throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary-prioritized Markov approach for dynamic spectrum allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.080031","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04674673.pdf","startPage":"1854","endPage":"1865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.080031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Primary-prioritized Markov approach for dynamic spectrum allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4674673/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627498","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary-prioritized Markov approach for dynamic spectrum allocation","sourcePdf":"1854-tw0904-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123812S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4674673","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4674675,"authors":[{"name":"Juyul Lee","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Minnesota, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4674675/4674675-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juyul Lee (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Hongik University, Korea, in 1996, and the M.S. degree in information and communications from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Korea, in 1998.

The transmitter/scheduler must determine how many bits to transmit, or equivalently how much energy to transmit with, during each time slot based on the current channel quality and the number of unserved bits, with the objective of minimizing expected total energy. In order to focus on the fundamental scheduling problem, it is assumed that no other packets are scheduled during this time period and no outage is allowed. Assuming transmission at capacity of the underlying Gaussian noise channel, a closed-form expression for the optimal scheduling policy is obtained for the case T = 2 via dynamic programming; for T > 2, the optimal policy can only be numerically determined. Thus, the focus of the work is on derivation of simple, near-optimal policies based on intuition from the T = 2 solution and the structure of the general problem. The proposed bit-allocation policies consist of a linear combination of a delay-associated term and an opportunistic (channel-aware) term. In addition, a variation of the problem in which the entire packet must be transmitted in a single slot is studied, and a channel-threshold policy is shown to be optimal.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.080037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04674675.pdf","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.080037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient scheduling of delay constrained traffic over fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674675/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient scheduling of delay constrained traffic over fading channels","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627499","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674675/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient scheduling of delay constrained traffic over fading channels","sourcePdf":"1866-tw0904-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093289S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4674675","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674679,"authors":[{"name":"Yongle Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4674679/4674679-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongle Wu (S'08) received the B.S.

However, users who are competing with each other for spectrum may have no incentive to cooperate, and they may even exchange false private information about their channel conditions in order to get more access to the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a repeated spectrum sharing game with cheat-proof strategies. By using the punishment-based repeated game, users get the incentive to share the spectrum in a cooperative way; and through mechanism-design-based and statistics-based approaches, user honesty is further enforced. Specific cooperation rules have been proposed based on the maximum total throughput and proportional fairness criteria. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the spectrum efficiency by alleviating mutual interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeated open spectrum sharing game with cheat-proof strategies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.080182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04674679.pdf","startPage":"1922","endPage":"1933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.080182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Repeated open spectrum sharing game with cheat-proof strategies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4674679/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627502","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeated open spectrum sharing game with cheat-proof strategies","sourcePdf":"1922-tw0904-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07299S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4674679","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674681,"authors":[{"name":"Shensheng Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4674681/4674681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shensheng Tang (SM'07) received his B.S. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, and M.S. degree from China Academy of Telecommunications Technology (CATT), Beijing, China, both in Electronic Engineering.

The secondary users employ spectrum sensing to detect channels that are unused by the primary users and hence make use of the idle channels. If an active secondary user detects the presence of a primary user on a given channel, it releases the channel and switches to another idle channel, if one is available. In the event that no channel is available, the call waits in a buffer until either a channel becomes available or a maximum waiting time is reached. Spectrum sensing errors on the part of a secondary user cause false alarm and mis-detection events, which can potentially degrade the quality-of-service experienced by primary users. We derive system performance metrics of interest such as blocking probabilities. Our results suggest that opportunistic spectrum sharing can significantly improve spectrum efficiency and system capacity, even under unreliable spectrum detection. The proposed model and analysis method can be used to evaluate the performance of future opportunistic spectrum sharing systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.080213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04674681.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of opportunistic spectrum sharing with unreliable spectrum sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4674681/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of opportunistic spectrum sharing with unreliable spectrum sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627503","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of opportunistic spectrum sharing with unreliable spectrum sensing","sourcePdf":"1934-tw0904-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095628S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4674681","onlineDate":"17 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4674709,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Caloz","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al ch. de PolytechnIque, Montreal, QC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/4674380/4674709/4674709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christophe Caloz received the Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur en Electricite and the PhD degrees from the Lausanne Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Switzerland, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.

We give a detailed description of the compensation and the identification part of the method and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674788","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674788.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive blind compensation of gain and timing mismatches in M-channel time-interleaved ADCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674788/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive blind compensation of gain and timing mismatches in M-channel time-interleaved ADCs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392325","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674788/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive blind compensation of gain and timing mismatches in M-channel time-interleaved ADCs","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07852S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674789,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These standards require support for multiple modulation and coding schemes. Hence, the receiver hardware should be able to accomodate these schemes preferably on a single reconfigurable architecture. Current MIMO detector implementations are constrained by the throughput and dynamic reconfigurability requirements. This paper presents an FPGA implementation of a novel MIMO detector architecture which addresses these issues. The proposed design is able to reconfigure on the fly without significant latency overhead and delivers quasi-optimal Bit Error Rate(BER). The regularity of the architecture makes it suitable for a highly parallel and pipelined implementation. Our design is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA, and has a parallelism factor of four with four pipeline stages. Additionally, the design does not use multipliers, and has minimal control overhead(0.3%). Our detector achieves a throughput of 280 Mbps for QPSK, 140 Mbps for 16-QAM, and 52.5 Mbps for 64-QAM. The detector, with a non-processor based control unit, has many qualities of a systolic architecture which makes it highly suitable for ASIC implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674791","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674791.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture for reconfigurable MIMO detector and its FPGA implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674791/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture for reconfigurable MIMO detector and its FPGA implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392327","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674791/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture for reconfigurable MIMO detector and its FPGA implementation","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083857S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674799,"authors":[{"name":"Bilel Belhadj","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Bilel","lastName":"Belhadj","id":"37542225000"},{"name":"Jean Tomas","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Tomas","id":"37352713100"},{"name":"Olivia Malot","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Malot","id":"37542226800"},{"name":"Gilles N'Kaoua","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"N'Kaoua","id":"37085726048"},{"name":"Yannick Bornat","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Bornat","id":"37402647500"},{"name":"Sylvie Renaud","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University Bordeaux 1 - CNRS/ENSEIRB, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Sylvie","lastName":"Renaud","id":"37402675500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674799","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":282},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based architecture for real-time synaptic plasticity computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Biology computing","Neurons","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer networks","Biological neural networks","Timing","Biological system modeling","Backplanes","Connectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based architecture","real-time synaptic plasticity computation","neural networks","neuromorphic system","configurable architecture","dedicated plasticity processor","spike timing-dependent plasticity"]}],"abstract":"Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for most models of learning, memory and development in neural networks.

The PA is designed for the UMTS W-CDMA standard which requires linearity from -20 dBm to 24 dBm output power. The power amplifier provides 31 dBm output power with 26% of power added efficiency (PAE) at 1.95 GHz. The linear gain is 20 dB and the compression point (OCP1) is 25.6 dBm. In order to meet the UMTS W-CDMA requirements, the PA is linear until 24 dBm, which is the maximum output power required by this standard.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674815","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674815.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 65 nm CMOS - Stacked Folded Fully Differential (SFFD) PA structure for W-CDMA application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674815/","displayDocTitle":"A 65 nm CMOS - Stacked Folded Fully Differential (SFFD) PA structure for W-CDMA application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388631","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674815/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 65 nm CMOS - Stacked Folded Fully Differential (SFFD) PA structure for W-CDMA application","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043661S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674816,"authors":[{"name":"Niklas Zimmermann","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Niklas","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"37605704100"},{"name":"Ralf Wunderlich","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Wunderlich","id":"37274427900"},{"name":"Stefan Heinen","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Heinen","id":"37269356200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674816","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":997},"abstract":"With increasing demand for higher integration and lower cost of mobile communication devices there is a growing trend towards the use of CMOS power amplifiers (PAs) instead of GaAs or SiGe PAs. Although being comparatively inexpensive, CMOS not only suffers from inferior RF performance but also from low breakdown voltages. This gets an issue especially for the PA output stage, when load mismatches lead to high voltage-standing wave ratios (VSWR) and therefore high peak voltages at the PA output. In this work a 27 dBm PA in 0.13 mum CMOS with an integrated VSWR protection circuit is presented. A control loop detects critically high voltage amplitudes at the PA output and reduces the PA gain in order to lower the output voltage swing to uncritical values.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Circuits","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Voltage","Costs","Mobile communication","High power amplifiers","Gallium arsenide","Silicon germanium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","Ge-Si alloys","III-V semiconductors","overvoltage protection","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overvoltage protection circuit","CMOS power amplifiers","mobile communication devices","low breakdown voltages","load mismatch","high voltage-standing wave ratios","integrated VSWR protection circuit","voltage amplitudes","output voltage swing","size 0.13 mum","GaAs","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["over-voltage protection","power amplifiers","reliability","CMOS analog integrated circuits","VSWR"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674816","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674816.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An over-voltage protection circuit for CMOS power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An over-voltage protection circuit for CMOS power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674816/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674816/","accessionNumber":"10392337","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An over-voltage protection circuit for CMOS power amplifiers","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042458S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4674818,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Nanowave Technologies, Inc., Etobicoke, Canada"],"lastName":"Jing Li","id":"37087153351"},{"name":"Oualid Hammi","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,  Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Oualid","lastName":"Hammi","id":"37294250700"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

The purpose was to determine a relationship between the temperature behaviour of the cell resistance and the programmed current level. Measurements were carried out in a temperature range from -10degC to 85degC, considering cells programmed to the fully crystalline and the fully amorphous state of the active GST portion, as well as cells programmed to eight intermediate current levels (i.e., levels corresponding to partial crystalline states).

Low-power is achieved since no operational amplifiers are required but, instead, simple source-followers are used. Simulation results of a complete front-end stage of a 6-bit 2-channel pipeline ADC demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS capacitors","Pipelines","Capacitance","Power amplifiers","Variable structure systems","Clocks","Circuit simulation","Sampling methods","Power supplies","Energy resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","MOS capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power time-interleaved MDAC","MOS capacitor amplification","pipeline ADC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674838","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674838.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New low-power 1.5-bit time-interleaved MDAC based on MOS capacitor amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New low-power 1.5-bit time-interleaved MDAC based on MOS capacitor amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674838/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674838/","accessionNumber":"10392347","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New low-power 1.5-bit time-interleaved MDAC based on MOS capacitor amplification","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046743S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674842,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Ho Lee","id":"37087289283"},{"name":"Yun Jeong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yun Jeong Kim","id":"37087620012"},{"name":"Suki Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suki Kim","id":"37087171182"},{"name":"Kwang Hyun Baek","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang Hyun Baek","id":"37087362378"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674842","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"abstract":"4-bit 2-Gsample/s flash A/D converter is presented.

The proposed algorithm is shown to be easily integrated in the peripheral image processing circuitry of a CMOS image sensor that holds JPEG compression capabilities. The proposed algorithm embeds the WM in middle frequency DCT coefficients, according to the output of a random number generator. This addresses the trade-off between the WM robustness and image quality degradation. Choosing the DCT coefficient in a pseudo-random manner provides higher effective coverage, as a potential attacker must consider a wide range of possible coefficients. Matlab simulations show the ability of the algorithm to ensure image authenticity even when changing only 2 DCT coefficients in each 8times8 block. The WM embedder was designed in Verilog according to the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674867","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674867.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of a DCT watermark for CMOS image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674867/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of a DCT watermark for CMOS image sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388666","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674867/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of a DCT watermark for CMOS image sensors","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068404S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4674868,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Xin Li","id":"37880872500"},{"name":"Yonatan Shoshan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Yonatan","lastName":"Shoshan","id":"37691612700"},{"name":"Alexander Fish","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Fish","id":"37268457100"},{"name":"Graham A.

The proposed RNG implementation is based on a Gollmann cascade of Filtered Feedback with Carry Shift Register (FFCSR) cores and is suitable for a wide range of applications. In order to comply with the demands of most applications the RNG must have low hardware cost and power dissipation, and be suitable for real time operation while maintaining a high level of security. In the proposed solution, elementary F-FCSR components are modularly combined to fit the RNG for the desirable application. The RNG will produce a pseudo-random sequence with suitable period, linear complexity and statistical quality. Simulations performed using the statistical test suite available through NIST, show that the proposed RNG holds good statistical properties, a secure mathematical structure and meets known standards.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674868","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674868.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674868","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","startPage":"372","endPage":"375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified approach for designing secure Random Number Generators in HW","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"A simplified approach for designing secure Random Number Generators in HW","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674868/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392354","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified approach for designing secure Random Number Generators in HW","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103375S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4674876,"authors":[{"name":"Slim Ben Othman","affiliation":["L.E.C.A.P.-E.P.T. / I.N.S.A.T, National Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Ben Othman","id":"37700694700"},{"name":"Ahmed Karim Ben Salem","affiliation":["L.E.C.A.P.-E.P.T. / I.N.S.A.T, National Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Karim","lastName":"Ben Salem","id":"37591749700"},{"name":"Slim Ben Saoud","affiliation":["L.E.C.A.P.-E.P.T. / I.N.S.A.T, National Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Slim Ben","lastName":"Saoud","id":"37695597700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674876","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPSoC design of RT control applications based on FPGA SoftCore processors","abstract":"Field programmable gate array (FPGA) based controller offer advantages such as high-speed complex functionality and low power consumption. According to the controller complexity, the FPGA design can be achieved by a multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) architectures with mixed software/hardware solutions. The aim of this paper is to design a full speed real time (RT) motor control drive algorithms for FPGA based MPSoC. To this purpose, a new approach is proposed to test controller design by implementing RT motor emulator linked to its controller drive in the same FPGA target. The gain with using this new approach is the ability to push past the operational limits of a specific environment and to test fault conditions that would otherwise be damaging or dangerous for a real motor. The developed MPSoC architectures consist of two and three SoftCore (MicroBlaze) processors that are linked by FIFO style communication. The implementation results, give an overview of MPSOC FPGA based controller benefits and illustrate the effect of interprocessor communication mode.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Testing","Application software","Energy consumption","Control systems","Multiprocessing systems","System-on-a-chip","Computer architecture","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","machine control","microprocessor chips","motor drives","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPSoC design","RT control applications","FPGA SoftCore processors","field programmable gate array","high-speed complex functionality","controller complexity","multiprocessor system on chip","full speed real time motor control drive","MicroBlaze","FIFO style communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674876","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674876","startPage":"404","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674876.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674876/","displayDocTitle":"MPSoC design of RT control applications based on FPGA SoftCore processors","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10388670","htmlLink":"/document/4674876/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPSoC design of RT control applications based on FPGA SoftCore processors","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052326S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4674879,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Binesh Marvasti","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza Binesh","lastName":"Marvasti","id":"37869989600"},{"name":"Masoud Daneshtalab","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Daneshtalab","id":"37298922900"},{"name":"Ali Afzali-Kusha","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afzali-Kusha","id":"38270948500"},{"name":"Siamak Mohammadi","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Siamak","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37275069800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674879","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Network-on-a-chip","Energy consumption","System recovery","Tiles","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Switches","System-on-a-chip","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network routing","network-on-chip","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAMPR","power-aware algorithm","minimum path routing","NoC","two-dimensional mesh on-chip networks","network-on-chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674879","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674879.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAMPR: Power-aware and minimum path routing algorithm for NoCs","abstract":"In this paper, a novel adaptive routing model for avoiding congested areas through utilization of an adaptive routing table in two-dimensional mesh on-chip networks is proposed.

To make it suitable for real-time image processing applications, it is essential to develop custom VLSI chips for computation of 2D-DWT. A new high efficient architecture is proposed for 2D 1-level DWT, with the feature of original data is scanned by group and no temporal buffer is needed.

By using a newly developed architecture based on ldquopreequalizerdquo scheme, the geometry ratio between the pull-up and pull-down driver transistors of conventional 6-T cell will be similar to that of familiar inverter, thereby making the SRAM be provided with an improved read static noise margin (SNM) and a reduced cell area. The removal of DC path resulting from preequalize also yields significant power reduction. To avoid a write speed degradation caused by the internal race on cell current between the pull-up driver transistor and access transistor, a write-power-off scheme is proposed. To further decrease the write power consumption, data drivers are connected to the bit lines instead of the conventional power supply terminals. A 4-kb-capacity test prototype has been designed in a 0.18-mum CMOS process. Achievable power reduction for the proposed SRAM is approximately 16% according to the post-layout simulation results (with the parasitics extracted), compared to that designed in the conventional architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674911","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674911.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact and low-power SRAM with improved read static noise margin","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674911/","displayDocTitle":"A compact and low-power SRAM with improved read static noise margin","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674911/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388686","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact and low-power SRAM with improved read static noise margin","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088169S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674913,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Nasalski","affiliation":["(T.U.L), DMCS, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Nasalski","id":"37569878500"},{"name":"Adam Makosiej","affiliation":["(T.U.L), DMCS, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Makosiej","id":"37569878700"},{"name":"Bastien Giraud","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur \u010fElectronique de Paris (I.

The double error correcting (DEC) BCH codes have not found favorable application in SRAMs due to non-alignment of their block sizes to typical memory word widths and particularly due to the large multi-cycle latency of traditional iterative decoding algorithms. This work presents DEC code design that is aligned to typical memory word widths and a parallel decoding implementation approach that operates on complete memory words in a single cycle. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated through ASIC implementations, in which it incurs only 1.4 ns and 2.2 ns decoding latencies for 16- and 64-bit words, respectively, using 90 nm ASIC technology. A comparative analysis between conventionally used ECC and DEC ECC for reliability gains and costs incurred has also been performed.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674921","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674921.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DEC ECC design to improve memory reliability in Sub-100nm technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DEC ECC design to improve memory reliability in Sub-100nm technologies","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10392383","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674921/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674921/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DEC ECC design to improve memory reliability in Sub-100nm technologies","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066786S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4674927,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Marin-Roig","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Gandia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Marin-Roig","id":"38273075700"},{"name":"Vicenc Almenar","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Gandia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicenc","lastName":"Almenar","id":"37271834700"},{"name":"Javier Valls","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Gandia, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Valls","id":"37271831000"},{"name":"Ma Jose Canet","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Gandia, Spain"],"firstName":"Ma Jose","lastName":"Canet","id":"37271836300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4674927","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Projection algorithms","Maximum likelihood decoding","Throughput","Bit error rate","Sorting","Iterative decoding","Receiving antennas","Telecommunications","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","error statistics","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","MIMO decoders","successive projection algorithm","SPA","Flag-SPA","Relaxed-SPA","iterative algorithm","K-best algorithm","BER","bit error rate","MIMO wireless data transmission technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674927","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674927.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"64-QAM 4\u00d74 MIMO decoders based on Successive Projection Algorithm","abstract":"This paper presents two algorithms to extend the MIMO-decoding capability of successive projection algorithm (SPA).

Compared to a conventional tripole cuff providing a single channel signal, additional information about the velocity and direction of nerve signals can be extracted from the multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, interference suppression is improved as the presented analysis shows. In this paper a new recording system is proposed, each channel of which consists of a low-noise input buffer employing lateral bipolar transistors to provide an impedance match to the tissue and a path to ground for the switching currents of a single high-gain amplifier, which is multiplexed between channels. The proposed system provides low-noise, low-power operation and practically identical channel gains and is suitable for integration in a CMOS process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Electrodes","Low-noise amplifiers","Electromyography","In vitro","Array signal processing","Data mining","Interference suppression","Bipolar transistors","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","biomedical electrodes","bipolar transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","interference suppression","low-power electronics","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexed ENG recording","CMOS technology","multielectrode cuff","parallel recording","neural signal","nerve signal","multielectrode recording","interference suppression","low-noise input buffer","bipolar transistor","impedance match","amplifier","low-power operation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674963","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04674963.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low noise front-end for multiplexed ENG recording using CMOS technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4674963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low noise front-end for multiplexed ENG recording using CMOS technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4674963/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4674963/","accessionNumber":"10388711","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low noise front-end for multiplexed ENG recording using CMOS technology","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124291S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4674963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4674964,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Then, the system is re-designed using Verilog HDL based on the SDL source. The FlexRay CC system was synthesized using Samsung 0.35 mum technology. It is shown that the designed system can operate in the frequency range above 80 MHz. In addition, to show the validity of the designed FlexRay system, the FlexRay system is combined with sound source localization system in Robot applications.

The accuracy and viability of both the proposed analysis and design approach is confirmed experimentally.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2008.4675056","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664823/4674773/04675056.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1130","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2008.4675056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design guidelines for minimum harmonic distortion in a wien oscillator with automatic amplitude control system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design guidelines for minimum harmonic distortion in a wien oscillator with automatic amplitude control system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4675056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392454","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675056/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design guidelines for minimum harmonic distortion in a wien oscillator with automatic amplitude control system","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04702S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2008-Sept. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664823","isNumber":"4674773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664823","xplore-issue":"4674773","articleId":"4675056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4675070,"authors":[{"name":"Suleyman Malki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology,Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Suleyman","lastName":"Malki","id":"37265811600"},{"name":"Lambert Spaanenburg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology,Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lambert","lastName":"Spaanenburg","id":"37265812600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2181-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2182-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4675070","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Computer networks","Reproducibility of results","Pipeline processing","Pixel","Information technology","Electronic mail","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft DT-CNN core","discrete-time cellular neural network","CNN instruction set architecture"]}],"abstract":"Digital implementations of discrete-time cellular neural networks have steadily been improved, gradually gaining capacity and therefore applicability.

In addition to providing high performance, the fault-tolerance and reliability of these networks is becoming a critical issue due to several artifacts of deep sub-micron technologies. Consequently, it is important for a designer to have access to fast methods for evaluating the performance, reliability, and energy-efficiency of an on-chip network. Towards this end, first, we propose a novel path-sensitive router architecture for low-latency applications. Next, we present a queuing-theory-based model for evaluating the performance and energy behavior of on-chip networks. Then the model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed router. The performance (average latency) and energy consumption results from the analytical model are validated with those obtained from a cycle-accurate simulator. Finally, we explore error detection and correction mechanisms that provide different energy-reliability-performance tradeoffs and extend our model to evaluate the on-chip network in the presence of these error protection schemes. Our reliability exploration culminates with the introduction of an array of transient fault protection techniques, both architectural and algorithmic, to tackle reliability issues within the router's individual hardware components. We propose a complete solution safeguarding against both the traditional link faults and internal router upsets, without incurring any significant latency, area and power overhead.","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","publicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675259","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4675258/4675259/04675277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of an NoC architecture from performance, reliability and energy perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675277/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of an NoC architecture from performance, reliability and energy perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675277/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10389352","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of an NoC architecture from performance, reliability and energy perspective","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"308200173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102328S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4675258","isNumber":"4675259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4675258","xplore-issue":"4675259","articleId":"4675277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4675278,"authors":[{"name":"Sarang Dharmapurikar","affiliation":["Washington University, Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Sarang","lastName":"Dharmapurikar","id":"37265776400"},{"name":"John Lockwood","affiliation":["Washington University, Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lockwood","id":"37271602700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-082-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-082-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4675278","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":72,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Matched filters","Filtering algorithms","Throughput","Inspection","Scalability","Random access memory","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable pattern matching","content filtering","high-speed packet content inspection","fast multi-pattern matching algorithm","specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms","line-speed packet processing","hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm","Aho-Corasick algorithm","Bloom filters","onchip memory","Snort string set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bloom filters","content filtering","network intrusion detection","pattern matching"]}],"abstract":"High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. Multi-pattern matching is known to require intensive memory accesses and is often a performance bottleneck. Hence specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms are being developed for line-speed packet processing. While several pattern matching algorithms have already been developed for such applications, we find that most of them suffer from scalability issues. To support a large number of patterns, the throughput is compromised or vice versa. We present a hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. We modify the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm to consider multiple characters at a time for higher throughput. Furthermore, we suppress a large fraction of memory accesses by using Bloom filters implemented with a small amount of on-chip memory. The resulting algorithm can support matching of several thousands of patterns at more than 10 Gbps with the help of a less than 50 KBytes of embedded memory and a few megabytes of external SRAM. We demonstrate the merit of our algorithm through theoretical analysis and simulations performed on Snort's string set.","doi":"10.1145/1095890.1095916","publicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4675258/4675259/04675278.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1095890.1095916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and scalable pattern matching for content filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675278/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and scalable pattern matching for content filtering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"10389353","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675278/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and scalable pattern matching for content filtering","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"308200183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051073S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4675258","isNumber":"4675259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4675258","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4675259","articleId":"4675278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4675279,"authors":[{"name":"Zachary K.

In addition, a software tool for automatically generating the hardware is presented. Intrusion detection for network security is a compute-intensive application demanding high system performance. By moving both the string matching and the linking of multi-part rules to hardware, our architecture leaves the host system free for higher-level analysis. The tool automates the creation of efficient field programmable gate array architectures (FPGA). The generated hardware allows an FPGA-based system to perform deep-packet inspection of streams at up to 10 Gb/s line rates at a high level of area efficiency. Going beyond previous basic string-matching implementations that offer only single-string matching, the architecture provides support for rules requiring complex, linked (correlated-content) constructions. This allows most Snort content-linking extensions including 'distance' and 'within' bounding restrictions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-throughput linked-pattern matching for intrusion detection systems","publicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","doi":"10.1145/1095890.1095918","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4675258/4675259/04675279.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1095890.1095918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"High-throughput linked-pattern matching for intrusion detection systems","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675279/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"10392981","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-throughput linked-pattern matching for intrusion detection systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"308200193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074375S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4675258","isNumber":"4675259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4675258","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4675259","articleId":"4675279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4675285,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The spontaneous emission spectra show significant improvement of the radiative emission for strain-compensated QW for all three structures compared to the corresponding conventional InGaN QW, which indicates the enhanced radiative efficiency for light emitting diodes.

Elite particles and bad particles are distinguished from the swarm after some initial iteration steps. Bad particles are replaced with the same number of elite particles, and a new swarm is generated. To avoid losing diversity of the swarm and to decrease the risk of trapping in local optimum, mutation operation is introduced in evolution process. The results of several simulations for different benchmark functions illustrate that EPSOM algorithm has the ability of local exploitation and global exploration. EPSOM algorithm outperforms the Linearly Decreasing Weight Particle Swarm Optimization (LDW-PSO) and Random Mutation Particle Swarm Optimization (RM-PSO) in respects of calculation accuracy and convergence.","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia Simulation Conference - 7th International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia Simulation Conference - 7th International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4668336/4675314/04675471.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elite Particle Swarm Optimization with mutation","doi":"10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Elite Particle Swarm Optimization with mutation","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389147","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4675471/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elite Particle Swarm Optimization with mutation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040385S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4668336","isNumber":"4675314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4668336","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4675314","articleId":"4675471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4675503,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38560002500"},{"name":"Yaqing Guo","affiliation":["Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Yaqing Guo","id":"37088148579"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1786-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1787-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4675503","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675503","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Uncertainty","Uncertain systems","Stochastic processes","Set theory","Space technology","Game theory","Fuzzy sets","System testing","Stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["command and control systems","decision making","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","game theory","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground attack","air formation","uncertain decision-making problems","military command and control","game theory","bimatrix game way"]}],"abstract":"With the development of modern military technology, uncertain decision-making problems become more and more exigent to be solved in military command and control.

By the way of uncertain simulation, and combined with bimatrix game way, we can get the strategy equilibrium.

The numerical examples show that the proposed technique is a feasible and practical method which can inspect the complex distribution of deteriorated stiffness although there is a difference between actual bridge and numerical model as well as uncertain noise occurred in the measured data.","doi":"10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675624","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1562","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia Simulation Conference - 7th International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4668336/4675314/04675624.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia Simulation Conference - 7th International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nondestructive evaluation of strengthened decks using a microgenetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridges","Solid modeling","Convergence","Concrete","Steel","Inverse problems","Finite element methods","Gold","Degradation","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridges (structures)","Gaussian distribution","genetic algorithms","maintenance engineering","nondestructive testing","reinforced concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nondestructive evaluation","strengthened decks","microgenetic algorithm","stiffness reduction","reinforced concrete bridges","steel plates","Gaussian distribution function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Nondestructive evaluation of strengthened decks using a microgenetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675624/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389234","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nondestructive evaluation of strengthened decks using a microgenetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11102008-00310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082218S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4668336","isNumber":"4675314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4668336","xplore-issue":"4675314","articleId":"4675624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4675635,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Mitianoudis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4670981/4675635/4675635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Mitianoudis received the Diploma degree in electronic and computer engineering from Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1998, the M.Sc. degree in communications and signal processing from Imperial College, London, U.K., in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in audio source separation using independent component analysis from Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K., in 2004.","Currently, he is working as a Research Associate at Imperial College London.

In the original framework, equal importance was given to all input images in the reconstruction of the ldquofusedrdquo image's intensity. Even though this assumption is valid for all applications involving sensors of the same modality, it might not be optimal in the case of multiple modality inputs of different intensity range. The authors propose a method for estimating the optimal intensity range (contrast) of the fused image via optimization of an image fusion index. The proposed approach can be employed in a general fusion scenario including multiple sensors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Independent component analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Layout","Image analysis","Acoustic sensors","Multimodal sensors","Computer vision","Temperature sensors","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","image reconstruction","independent component analysis","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal contrast correction","multimodal images","self-trained independent component analysis","image fusion index","image reconstruction","multiple sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Independent component analysis (ICA)","multimodal image fusion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2008.2007678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4670981/04675635.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2008.2007678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Contrast Correction for ICA-Based Fusion of Multimodal Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Contrast Correction for ICA-Based Fusion of Multimodal Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675635/","volume":"8","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675635/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10470676","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Contrast Correction for ICA-Based Fusion of Multimodal Images","sourcePdf":"jsen-mitanoudis-2007678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088855S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4670981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4670981","articleId":"4675635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":4675673,"authors":[{"name":"Suresh V.

The purpose of this paper is to present three-dimensional simulations using finite-element method (FEM) of thermomechanical stresses and strains in 1550-nm laser modules induced by Nd:YAG crystal laser welds and thermal cycles on main subassembly laser submount. Nonlinear FEM computations, taking into account of experimental sigma(epsiv) measured curves, show that the laser welding process can induce high level of strains in columns of the laser platform, bearing the laser diode, responsible of an optical axis shift and a gradual drop of the optical power in relation with relaxation of accumulated stresses in the subassembly (W. M. Sherry et al., ldquoHigh performance optoelectronic packaging for 2.5 and 10 Gb/s laser modules,rdquo in Proc. Electron. Compon. Technol. Conf., 1996, pp. 620-627). Typical stresses are close to 160 MPa with drift about 5 MPa with the dispersion of energy level of the laser Nd: YAG beam. The introduction of both material and process dispersion in order to evaluate their impact on product lifetime distribution has been taking into account. In the case of thermal cycles, stresses can occur on elements sensitive to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches such as solder joints between the laser platform and thermoelectric cooler and as fiber glued into the pigtail leading to crack propagation with sudden drop of optical power. A previous paper demonstrated that laser submount is the most sensitive part of optical system (Deshayes, et al., ldquoThree-dimensional FEM simulations of thermal mechanical stresses in 1.55 mum laser modules,rdquo Microelectron. Rel., vol. 43, no. 7, pp. 1125 -1136, Jul. 2003). Experimental analyses were also conducted to correlate simulation results and monitor the output optical power of laser modules after 500 thermal cycles ( -40degC/ + 85degC VRT).","doi":"10.1109/TCAPT.2008.2001173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6144/4675655/04675674.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2008.2001173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulations of Thermomechanical Stresses and Optical Misalignment in 1550-nm Transmitter Optoelectronic Modules Using FEM and Process Dispersions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675674/","displayDocTitle":"Simulations of Thermomechanical Stresses and Optical Misalignment in 1550-nm Transmitter Optoelectronic Modules Using FEM and Process Dispersions","volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324545","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675674/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulations of Thermomechanical Stresses and Optical Misalignment in 1550-nm Transmitter Optoelectronic Modules Using FEM and Process Dispersions","sourcePdf":"tcapt-deshayes-2001173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094985S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"4675655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4675655","articleId":"4675674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4675714,"authors":[{"name":"Atilla Eryilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Atilla","lastName":"Eryilmaz","id":"37300991700"},{"name":"Asuman Ozdaglar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Ozdaglar","id":"37300992700"},{"name":"Muriel Medard","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"Medard","id":"37268947300"},{"name":"Ebad Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ebad","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37584941300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4675714","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":644},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Network coding","Performance gain","Wireless networks","Transmitters","Network topology","Performance analysis","Satellite broadcasting","Gain measurement","Complex networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","packet radio networks","random codes","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay gains","throughput gains","unreliable packet network setting","optimal transmission strategy","maximum-distance separable","digital fountain codes","random network codes","complex network topology","network coding","joint scheduling","random-access scheme","wireless network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast","delay analysis","erasure channel","maximum-distance separable (MDS) codes","network coding"]}],"abstract":"In an unreliable packet network setting, we study the performance gains of optimal transmission strategies in the presence and absence of coding capability at the transmitter, where performance is measured in delay and throughput. Although our results apply to a large class of coding strategies including maximum-distance separable (MDS) and Digital Fountain codes, we use random network codes in our discussions because these codes have a greater applicability for complex network topologies. To that end, after introducing a key setting in which performance analysis and comparison can be carried out, we provide closed-form as well as asymptotic expressions for the delay performance with and without network coding. We show that the network coding capability can lead to arbitrarily better delay performance as the system parameters scale when compared to traditional transmission strategies without coding. We further develop a joint scheduling and random-access scheme to extend our results to general wireless network topologies.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2006454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4675712/04675714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2006454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675712","startPage":"5511","endPage":"5524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Delay and Throughput Gains of Coding in Unreliable Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Delay and Throughput Gains of Coding in Unreliable Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324558","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Delay and Throughput Gains of Coding in Unreliable Networks","sourcePdf":"54tit12-aeryilmaz-2006454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044038S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","isNumber":"4675712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"106","articleId":"4675714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4675715,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew S.

Traditionally, the channel between the encoder and decoder in the source network is assumed to be one-way. This, together with the fact that the encoder does not have access to Y, implies that the encoder has to know the achievable rates before encoding. In this paper, we consider universal source coding for a feedback source network in which the channel between the encoder and decoder is two-way and asymmetric. Assume that the encoder and decoder share a random database that is independent of both X and Y. A string matching-based (variable-rate) block coding algorithm with simple progressive encoding and joint typicality decoding is first proposed for the feedback source network. The simple progressive encoder does not need to know the achievable rates at the beginning of encoding. It is proven that for any (X, Y) in a large class of sources satisfying some mixing conditions, the average number of bits per letter transmitted from the encoder to the decoder (compression rate) goes to the conditional entropy H(X | Y) of X given Y asymptotically, and at the same time the average number of bits per letter transmitted from the decoder to the encoder (feedback rate) goes to 0 asymptotically. The algorithm and the corresponding analysis results are then extended to the case where both X and Y are to be encoded separately, but decoded jointly. Finally, a universal decoding algorithm is proposed to replace the joint typicality decoding, and the resulting universal compression algorithm consisting of the simple progressive encoder and the universal decoding algorithm is further shown to be asymptotically optimal for the class of all jointly memoryless source-side information pairs (X,Y).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324568","htmlLink":"/document/4675724/","displayDocTitle":"Universal Multiterminal Source Coding Algorithms With Asymptotically Zero Feedback: Fixed Database Case","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Multiterminal Source Coding Algorithms With Asymptotically Zero Feedback: Fixed Database Case","sourcePdf":"54tit12-eyang-2006449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108877S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4675712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4675712","articleId":"4675724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4675727,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications MCI and the Technical, University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"},{"name":"Martin Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265056000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4675727","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calculus","Interference","Power control","MIMO","Mobile communication","Quality of service","Game theory","Robustness","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["log normal distribution","quality of service","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calculus","log-convex interference functions","interference-coupled multiuser systems","logarithmically convex interference function","quality-of-service","linear interference model","nonnegative matrices","Perron-Frobenius theory","robust communication","cooperative game theory","max-min fairness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable region","interference function","log-convex","max-min fairness","multiuser wireless communication","quality-of-service (QoS)"]}],"abstract":"The behavior of certain interference-coupled multiuser systems can be modeled by means of logarithmically convex (log-convex) interference functions.

The results also contribute to a better understanding of certain quality-of-service (QoS) tradeoff regions, which can be expressed as sublevel sets of log-convex interference functions. We analyze the structure of the QoS region and provide conditions for the achievability of boundary points. The proposed framework of log-convex interference functions generalizes the classical linear interference model, which is closely connected with the theory of irreducible nonnegative matrices (Perron-Frobenius theory).

Our results are initially developed in a \u201csemi-stochastic\u201d setting, where the noiseless signal is an unknown individual sequence, and the only source of randomness is due to the channel noise. It is subsequently shown that in the fully stochastic setting, where the noiseless sequence is a stationary stochastic process, our schemes universally attain optimum performance.

In this paper, we make a first step in studying this method, and show that by starting from a simple LP problem and adaptively adding the necessary constraints, the complexity of LP decoding can be significantly reduced. In particular, we observe that with adaptive LP decoding, the sizes of the LP problems that need to be solved become practically independent of the density of the parity-check matrix. We further show that adaptively adding extra constraints, such as constraints based on redundant parity checks, can provide large gains in the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2006384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4675712/04675739.pdf","startPage":"5396","endPage":"5410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2006384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Methods for Linear Programming Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Methods for Linear Programming Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675739/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10324579","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675739/","volume":"54","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Methods for Linear Programming Decoding","sourcePdf":"54tit12-mtaghavin-2006384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08681S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4675712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4675712","articleId":"4675739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4675741,"authors":[{"name":"Raul H.

It is also not known how tight the existing outer bounds are. In this work, we show that the existing outer bounds can in fact be arbitrarily loose in some parameter ranges, and by deriving new outer bounds, we show that a very simple and explicit Han-Kobayashi type scheme can achieve to within a single bit per second per hertz (bit/s/Hz) of the capacity for all values of the channel parameters. We also show that the scheme is asymptotically optimal at certain high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Using our results, we provide a natural generalization of the point-to-point classical notion of degrees of freedom to interference-limited scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2006447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2006447","startPage":"5534","endPage":"5562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4675712/04675741.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Interference Channel Capacity to Within One Bit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Interference Channel Capacity to Within One Bit","volume":"54","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324581","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4675741/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Interference Channel Capacity to Within One Bit","sourcePdf":"54tit12-retkin-2006447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084978S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4675712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"919","xplore-issue":"4675712","articleId":"4675741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4675744,"authors":[{"name":"Boon Loong Ng","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Centre for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks (CUBIN), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Boon Loong","lastName":"Ng","id":"37269074300"},{"name":"Jamie S.

We exploit the structure of the channel and develop distributed beamforming algorithms using local message passing between neighboring base stations. For 1-D networks, we use the Kalman smoothing framework to obtain a forward-backward beamforming algorithm. We also propose a limited extent version of this algorithm that shows that the delay need not grow with the size of the network in practice. For 2-D cellular networks, we remodel the network as a factor graph and present a distributed beamforming algorithm based on the sum-product algorithm.

Based on the observed properties of parity-check matrices with good stopping redundancy characteristics, we develop a novel decoding technique, termed automorphism group decoding, that combines iterative message passing and permutation decoding. We also present bounds on the smallest number of permutations of an automorphism group decoder needed to correct any set of erasures up to a prescribed size.

At the multiple-antenna receiver, efficient successive group interference cancellation strategies based on zero-forcing or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filtering are employed in some fixed or channel-dependent order. These strategies are efficient in the sense that they exploit the special structure of the inner codes to yield much higher diversity orders than would be otherwise possible, while at the same time preserving what we call the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">decoupling</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">property</i>\n of the constituent inner codes which enables the use of low-complexity outer encoders/decoders for each user.

This record of internal state transitions forms an induced feature set for any string run through the side effect machine. In this study the number of times a machine passes though each state is used as a numerical feature set for classification. Finite state machines are trained with an evolutionary algorithm to produce feature sets that are very easy for an unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering, to learn. The system is demonstrated on synthetic and biological data. The biological data are PCR-primers classified by their success at amplification. The parameters, number of states, population size, and mutation rates are explored to characterize their effect on performance.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining on EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the signal underlying information content illustration by representing time-frequency patterns on Wavelet Coherence qualitative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions on time-frequency spectrum during the specified task on BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns were classified using a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). This innovative characteristic of the process justify the feasibility of the proposed approach on another data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches on this field and researches on different non-stationary time series analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern recognition for brain-computer interface on disabled subjects using a wavelet transformation","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2008.4675776","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669529/4675751/04675776.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2008.4675776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pattern recognition for brain-computer interface on disabled subjects using a wavelet transformation","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4675776/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10397408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern recognition for brain-computer interface on disabled subjects using a wavelet transformation","confLoc":"Sun Valley, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093181S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669529","isNumber":"4675751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669529","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4675751","articleId":"4675776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4675778,"authors":[{"name":"Yifeng Li","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligence Information Processing, School of Information Science and Technology, Shandong Institute of Light Industry, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Yifeng Li","id":"37087172872"},{"name":"Yihui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligence Information Processing, School of Information Science and Technology, Shandong Institute of Light Industry, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yihui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405156200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1778-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1779-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4675778","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675778","abstract":"Protein mass spectrometry is an integration of mass spectrometry and biological chip techniques, and it shows great potential for exploration of biomarkers and diagnosis of diseases.

multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) modulation scheme can improve the spectrum efficiency over the traditional cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM technology at the cost of computational efforts due to the iterative padding subtraction (IPS) at the receiver to mitigate the inter symbol interference caused by the multipath propagation. In this paper, a simplified equalization scheme is presented for the dual PN-sequence padding (DPNP) TDS-OFDM systems. Although the length of the padded PN sequence needed is double compared to what needed by the IPS, leading to slight decrease of the spectrum efficiency, this method can save about 90% computational effort in practice compared with that of the IPS algorithm. It also outperforms IPS method under the time-varying fading channel in terms of symbol error rate and maximum Doppler frequency, verified by the computer simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified Equalization Method for Dual PN-Sequence Padding TDS-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2008.2001725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4675807/04675811.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2008.2001725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4675811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4675811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Equalization Method for Dual PN-Sequence Padding TDS-OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4675811/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349022","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Equalization Method for Dual PN-Sequence Padding TDS-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-fu-2001725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066547S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4675807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4675807","articleId":"4675811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4675814,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, it requires the accurate loss model and the knowledge of the motor parameters. Therefore, a technical difficulty in deriving the loss-model-based controller (LMC) lies in the complexity of the full loss model and the online motor parameter adaptation. In an effort to overcome the drawbacks of LMC, this paper presents a new strategy for inverter-fed induction motors drives aiming for both high efficiency and high dynamic performance. A new LMC incorporating the effect of the leakage inductance and an adaptive-backstepping-based nonlinear controller are designed and combined with each other. Thus, online parameter adaptation of LMC can be obtained with no extra effort. The proposed control scheme is implemented in real time using digital signal processor board DS 1104.

It uses advantages of OFDM systems to provide pre-compensation of the frequency-dependent distortions, which are results of the power amplifiers (PA) memory effects. The process of memory effects quantification is carried out in this paper by obtaining a frequency-dependent PA gain, phase shift and intermodulation products. The memory effects are eliminated at baseband using equalization of the IDFT signal. Implementation of the equalization procedure at baseband makes the process of minimizing memory effects simple and effective, because no additional RF components or feedback loops are used. Memory effects are compensated in DSP part using simple multiplication of the frequency-domain digital signal by coefficients, which are calculated adaptively for each OFDM sub-carrier frequency and input power. The approach is tested with Motorola MOSFET MRF9742 power amplifier model in Advanced Design System (ADS). Simulations show significant improvement in minimizing memory effects. Received constellation of the 16-QAM OFDM signal after implementing baseband pre-compensation technique looks alike ideal one, whereas without pre-compensation it shows high dispersion due to the presence of PA memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing memory effects in OFDM transmitters using adaptive baseband equalization","publicationTitle":"2008 18th International Crimean Conference - Microwave & Telecommunication Technology","doi":"10.1109/CRMICO.2008.4676377","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 18th International Crimean Conference - Microwave & Telecommunication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663470/4676275/04676377.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRMICO.2008.4676377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4676377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4676377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing memory effects in OFDM transmitters using adaptive baseband equalization","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4676377/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10395579","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing memory effects in OFDM transmitters using adaptive baseband equalization","confLoc":"Sevastopol, UKraine","sourcePdf":"SPI-11132008-00102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054076S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663470","isNumber":"4676275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663470","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4676275","articleId":"4676377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CriMiCo (Crimean Microwave Conference)IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4676445,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this manner, there are two fundamental steps of the study. They are the definition of the transfer function and feature extraction which is related to the bearing damage characterization in electric motors. The definition of the feature transfer function is done between the first scale of the CWT analysis and original vibration signal in the frequency domain.

Currently fingerprint technology is suitable to recognize users with high accuracy and low execution times using microprocessors able to solve algorithms with high-computational cost. However, the microprocessorpsilas cost could make the use of fingerprint biometric conditional on specific applications. This paper presents the implementation of a whole minutiae extraction fingerprint algorithm using a Spartan-3 FPGA, as an appropriate solution for portable devices and for the low-cost consumer market. The internal architecture of the proposed embedded system is based on a soft-core microprocessor and several dedicated coprocessors designed in order to accelerate the resolution of the algorithm. Experimental results show as minutiae of fingerprint are obtained in 988 ms when an image of 256 times 256 pixels is analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4676920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10395911","htmlLink":"/document/4676920/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a minutiae extraction fingerprint algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a minutiae extraction fingerprint algorithm","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05746S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4676920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4676948,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Izydorczyk","affiliation":["Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Izydorczyk","id":"37541669200"},{"name":"Ludwig Cionaka","affiliation":["Institute of Refractory Materials, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Ludwig","lastName":"Cionaka","id":"37870875100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4676948","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4676948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Vector quantization","Euclidean distance","Digital filters","Polynomials","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing","Adders","Logic circuits","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","FIR filters","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signed power-of-two term allocation scheme","FIR filter design","optimal vector quantization","finite impulse response filters","Euclidean distance","Parks-McClellan methodology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4676948","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04676948.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1982","endPage":"1985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4676948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signed power-of-two term allocation scheme for the design of FIR filters","abstract":"The article presents a new algorithm for optimal vector quantization of a finite impulse response (FIR) filterpsilas coefficients using signed power of two format.

The objective is to improve the compensation performance of a conventional active power filter (APF) with a homogeneous neural structure allowing an efficient hardware implementation. The first control approach is based on a neural PI regulator. This technique uses an Adaline to determine the PI parameters. The second control approach is a direct inverse control method. It uses two multilayer neural networks with the backpropagation learning in order to identify the Jacobian of the process and to control the inverter. The originality lies in the error signal used for the weight adaption in the first approach, and in the choice of the inputs of the neural networks in the second approach. The performance of the two methods is evaluated through simulation and experimental results and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed neural approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677022","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677022.pdf","startPage":"1879","endPage":"1884","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks to control an inverter in a harmonic distortion compensation scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks to control an inverter in a harmonic distortion compensation scheme","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10396013","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677022/","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks to control an inverter in a harmonic distortion compensation scheme","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.17173S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4677030,"authors":[{"name":"F.

System restoration is critical due to difficulties in searching process by the utilities maintenance crew. Usually fault searching methods employed by utilities may lead to different locations to the same fault, mainly if the feeder is dense connected. There have been many approaches in order to overcome this problem. One popular method applies short-circuits indicators to be allocated along the feeders. Nevertheless, their cost can be a limitation for the method. In this context, this work issues the problem of optimal short-circuit indicator allocation along electrical network. The allocation is optimally accomplished in order to minimize the fault searching area of the utility maintenance crew. As the the problem formulation leads to a multimodal discrete nonlinear optimization, a genetic algorithm has been the optimizer tool selected to accomplished it. The technique has been tested on a model of a feeder of an Brazilpsilas Utility. The results showed a significant improvement over ad-hoc methodologies usually adopted by utilities.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677030","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"2236","endPage":"2241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677030.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Genetic algorithms","Fault location","Impedance","Power system modeling","Substations","Power system restoration","Power system reliability","Relays","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric sensing devices","genetic algorithms","power distribution faults","short-circuit currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal positioning","geo-referenced short circuit sensors","genetic algorithm","electric energy distribution system","system restoration","searching process","electrical network","multimodal discrete nonlinear optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal positioning of geo-referenced short circuit sensors for faster fault finding using genetic algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677030/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677030/","accessionNumber":"10396021","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal positioning of geo-referenced short circuit sensors for faster fault finding using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050053S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4677042,"authors":[{"name":"Hisayuki Sugimura","affiliation":["Kyungnam University, Masan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hisayuki Sugimura","id":"37087504929"},{"name":"Sang-Pil Mun","affiliation":["Kyungnam University, Masan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Pil Mun","id":"37087506685"},{"name":"Soon-Kurl Kwon","affiliation":["Kyungnam University, Masan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soon-Kurl Kwon","id":"37087557846"},{"name":"Kazunori Nishimura","affiliation":["Hiroshima Institute of Technology, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazunori Nishimura","id":"37087677434"},{"name":"Mutsuo Nakaoka","affiliation":["Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan","Kyungnam University, Masan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Mutsuo Nakaoka","id":"37087252879"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677042","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Voltage","Switches","Frequency conversion","Switching converters","Switching circuits","Pulse circuits","Space vector pulse width modulation","Frequency modulation","Commutation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cycloconvertors","frequency convertors","PWM power convertors","resonant power convertors","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active voltage clamped edge-resonant cyclo-converter","PWM high frequency cyclo-converter","direct power frequency conversion","pulse modulated conditioning circuit","bidirectional power switches","active zero voltage clamped soft commutation","consumer induction heating","resonant high frequency PWM controlled power frequency converter","resonant high frequency converter","switching mode equivalent circuits","zero voltage soft switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional switches","high frequency AC direct power frequency conversion","Active edge resonant scheme","Soft switching","Asymmetrical PWM","IH fixing roller in copy machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677042","abstract":"This paper presents a utility frequency AC (UFAC) to high frequency AC (HFAC) direct power frequency conversion pulse modulated conditioning circuit using bidirectional power switches.

The analytical inverse system can realize D&L of nonlinear system when the model is exactly known, but for the induction motor with parameters varying and disturbance, the D&L is destroyed. So the neural network inverse system (NNIS) theory was adapted to approximate the analytical inverse system in order to weaken the couple of rotor flux and speed, the NNIS was designed for the induction motor in the synchronous rotating (dq) reference frame in this paper. Through the analytical inverse system expression we pointed out that the D&L effect is unrelated to the position of d axis. Subsequently, the neural network inverse control (NNIC) structure was proposed. As a special case, the NNIS of induction motor in rotor field oriented (MT) reference frame was also given, the comparison of this NNIC with direct rotor field oriented control (DRFOC) was done and we conclude that it is an improved method of DRFOC.

Radiation effects have to be investigated in order to measure the fault tolerance degree of the applications and to validate new mitigation techniques. Fault injection is one of the possible evaluation methods. Several platforms have been developed in the past years in order to inject soft errors within FPGAs, however they have their greater drawbacks in intrusiveness and high-costs. In this paper we propose a new, low-cost and not-intrusive, fault injection platform to emulate soft errors within the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs. In particular, radiation effects can be evaluated without modifying neither the circuit implemented in the FPGA nor the application it executes, thus allowing to study the real system that will take part to the mission. Experimental results on several test circuits are reported and commented, demonstrating the feasibility of the presented approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396068","htmlLink":"/document/4677077/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new low-cost non intrusive platform for injecting soft errors in SRAM-based FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new low-cost non intrusive platform for injecting soft errors in SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052829S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4677079,"authors":[{"name":"Shady M.

The measured currents are used as reference model for the MRAS observer to avoid the use of a pure integrator. A two layer Neural Network (NN) stator current observer is used as the adaptive model which requires the rotor flux information. This can be obtained from the voltage or current model but instability and dc drift can downgrade the overall observer performance. To overcome these problems another off-line trained multilayer feedforward NN is proposed here as a rotor flux observer. Speed estimation performance of the MRAS scheme using the three different rotor flux observers is studied and compared when applied to an indirect vector control induction motor drive. Promising results have been obtained when using the NN flux observer with less sensitivity to parameter variation and stability in the regenerating mode of operation.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677079","startPage":"650","endPage":"655","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677079.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based stator current MRAS observer for speed sensorless induction motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stators","Induction motor drives","Rotors","Adaptive systems","Current measurement","Voltage","Multi-layer neural network","Machine vector control","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","induction motor drives","machine vector control","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based stator current observer","speed sensorless induction motor drives","model reference adaptive system","speed observer","two-layer neural network","off-line trained multilayer feedforward neural network","speed estimation","indirect vector control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based stator current MRAS observer for speed sensorless induction motor drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10396070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based stator current MRAS observer for speed sensorless induction motor drives","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057602S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677085,"authors":[{"name":"Dahai Zhang","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"lastName":"Dahai Zhang","id":"37087348597"},{"name":"Zhiwu Ren","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Zhiwu Ren","id":"37087347683"},{"name":"Yanbing Bi","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"lastName":"Yanbing Bi","id":"37087348022"},{"name":"Dazhou Zhou","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"lastName":"Dazhou Zhou","id":"37087347561"},{"name":"Yanqiu Bi","affiliation":["Shandong University, China"],"lastName":"Yanqiu Bi","id":"37087348662"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677085","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Prediction methods","Electronic mail","Equations","Bismuth","Least squares methods","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey systems","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power load forecasting","grey neural network","artificial neural network","grey prediction method","accumulation generation operation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677085","abstract":"To improve the accuracy of power load forecasting, this paper analyzes the defects as well as merits of artificial neural network (ANN) and grey prediction method, and it combines the two methods to propose a novel forecasting method called grey neural network (GNN).

At the same time the theoretical error of traditional grey prediction method is avoided.

To achieve robust motion control, acceleration control has been studied. In the acceleration control, disturbance observer is used to estimate and compensate disturbance force applied to an actuator. In the disturbance observer, the disturbance is estimated with calculating acceleration based on velocity/position information, and the estimated disturbance is obtained through a low-pass filter. To achieve accurate disturbance estimation, higher cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter and exact acceleration information are required. To set higher cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter, shortening sampling period is an effective method using FPGA as a motion control processor. However, short sampling period generally deteriorates the resolution of the velocity/acceleration information. This means that the estimated disturbance can include large error. In this paper, an acceleration estimation method is proposed to improve the resolution of acceleration in systems whose sampling period is very short. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to acceleration estimation using FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677086","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677086.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"An approach to acceleration estimation using FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677086/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396077","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to acceleration estimation using FPGA","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043567S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4677093,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The focus of this paper is the implementation of a real time embedded face detection system while relying on high level description language such as SystemC. Recently, the boosting based object detection algorithms proposed by have gained a lot of attention and are considered as the fastest accurate object detection algorithms today. However, the embedded implementation of such algorithms into hardware is still a challenge, since these algorithms are heavily based on memory access. We built a parallel implementation that exploits the parallelism and the pipelining in these algorithms. We show that, using a SystemC description model paired with a mainstream automatic synthesis tool, can lead to an efficient hardware implementation. We also display some of the tradeoffs and considerations, for this implementation to be effective. This implementation proves capable of increasing the speed of the detector as well as bringing regularity in time consuming. The design implementation is reasonably low on FPGA resource utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677098.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1697","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of boosting based object detection using a high level description","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Boosting","Object detection","Face detection","Face recognition","Real time systems","Pipeline processing","Displays","Detectors","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level languages","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face detection","face recognition","object detection","high level description","mainstream automatic synthesis","SystemC description model","FPGA resource utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of boosting based object detection using a high level description","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396089","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of boosting based object detection using a high level description","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104338S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677105,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Dufour","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Dufour","id":"37274485900"},{"name":"Vincent Lapointe","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lapointe","id":"37293875700"},{"name":"Jean Belanger","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Belanger","id":"37274557800"},{"name":"Simon Abourida","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Abourida","id":"37293874200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677105","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1089},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Prototypes","Control systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Motor drives","Computational modeling","Synchronous motors","Inductance","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control engineering computing","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","finite element analysis","machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-in-the-loop closed-loop control","FPGA-based permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system","rapidly prototyped controller","virtual permanent magnet synchronous motor drive","field- programmable gate array card","finite element analysis","Xilinx system generator","phase-domain algorithm solver","PWM controller","current control","speed control"]}],"abstract":"Presented in this paper are the results of closed-loop control experiments using a virtual permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive implemented on a field- programmable gate array (FPGA) card connected to an external controller. The FPGA-based PMSM motor drive is implemented on an eDRIVEsim simulator, based on the RT-LAB platform. The eDRIVEsim simulator implements 2 types of motor drive models, Park (d-q) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), on an FPGA card of the simulator. The FPGA-based motor model is designed with Xilinx System Generator (XSG) blockset with no HDL hand coding. Both motor models compute motor currents using a phase-domain algorithm solver that can take into account the instantaneous variation of inductance and non-sinusoidal induced voltage. The FEA-type model uses inductance and Back-EMF profiles computed with JMAG-RT. The d-q model uses sinusoidal induced Back-EMF voltage and phase inductance values computed from Ld and Lq using the well-known Park transformation. A 3-phase IGBT inverter implemented in the FPGA chip drives the PMSM machine. The PWM controller is designed using Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) methodology based on Simulink. It is implemented on an separate RT-LAB system using standard Opal-RT FPGA-based I/O cards for Analog Input capture and PWM generation. The paper presents results from the closed-loop control of the PMSM drive in both current control and speed control modes and discusses the advantages of using such a virtual test bench for motor drives.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677105","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop closed-loop experiments with an FPGA-based permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system and a rapidly prototyped controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop closed-loop experiments with an FPGA-based permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system and a rapidly prototyped controller","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677105/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396096","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677105/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-in-the-loop closed-loop experiments with an FPGA-based permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system and a rapidly prototyped controller","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072844S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4677118,"authors":[{"name":"Lieu My Chuong","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded System, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lieu My Chuong","id":"37872423000"},{"name":"Lam Siew Kei","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded System, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lam Siew Kei","id":"37266072500"},{"name":"Thambipillai Srikanthan","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded System, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Thambipillai Srikanthan","id":"37266928200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677118","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Optimizing compilers","Flow graphs","Clocks","Embedded system","Instruments","Parameter estimation","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","circuit layout","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","program compilers","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level delay estimation technique","C-based application porting","FPGA","rapid area-time estimation","design exploration","compiler","intermediate representation","architecture template","application-specific heterogeneous functional units","simplified floor-planning process","interconnect delay estimation"]}],"abstract":"Rapid area-time estimation is an instrumental step for efficient design exploration of FPGA-based implementations. In this paper, we address the issue of high-level delay estimation for porting C-based applications onto FPGA. In particular, we present a framework which incorporates a compiler to generate optimized high-level IR (intermediate representation) of the C-applications and an estimation model that is based on an architecture template with application-specific heterogeneous functional units. In order to accurately predict the post place and route delay of the design, the proposed estimation strategy performs a simplified floor-planning process. This leads to more accurate interconnect delay estimation, which is then combined with the pre-characterized delay parameters of the components. Experimental results based on a set of embedded functions show that the proposed estimation technique can achieve comparable results with synthesis results from a commercial FPGA tool in significantly shorter amount of time. In particular, the proposed method has an average error of only 4% with a maximum error of 10%. In addition, the proposed method leads to more consistent estimation results when compared to the Xilinx synthesis tool and to a naive approach that only employs pre-characterized parameters in the estimation model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-level delay estimation technique for porting C-based applications on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677118","startPage":"1991","endPage":"1996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677118.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"High-level delay estimation technique for porting C-based applications on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677118/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396109","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-level delay estimation technique for porting C-based applications on FPGA","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098372S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4677122,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A component can be a self-contained computer, including system and application software, an FPGA, or a custom hardware unit. By providing a single uniform interface to all types of components for the exchange of messages, the architecture supports the component-based design of large applications and enables the massive reuse of components.

Furthermore, mechanisms for integrated resource management support dynamically changing resource requirements (e.g., different operational modes of an application), fault-tolerance, a power-aware system behavior, and the implementation of fault-handling by reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677135","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The time-triggered System-on-a-Chip architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The time-triggered System-on-a-Chip architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677135/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396126","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The time-triggered System-on-a-Chip architecture","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141299S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4677156,"authors":[{"name":"Irma Villar","affiliation":["Power Electronics Area, IKERLAN-IK4 Technology Research Centre, Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Irma","lastName":"Villar","id":"38272417300"},{"name":"Alfred Rufer","affiliation":["STI-IEL-LEI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Rufer","id":"37271772900"},{"name":"Unai Viscarret","affiliation":["Power Electronics Area, IKERLAN-IK4 Technology Research Centre, Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Unai","lastName":"Viscarret","id":"37331180100"},{"name":"Frederic Zurkinden","affiliation":["STI-IEL-LEI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Zurkinden","id":"38274723600"},{"name":"Ion Etxeberria-Otadui","affiliation":["Power Electronics Area, IKERLAN-IK4 Technology Research Centre, Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Etxeberria-Otadui","id":"38271899200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677156","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":656},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Core loss","Power transformers","Medium voltage","Transformer cores","Magnetic cores","Frequency conversion","Magnetic materials","Semiconductor materials","Power semiconductor devices","Magnetic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","losses","power transformers","transformer cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical core loss evaluation methods","nonsinusoidally fed medium frequency power transformers","medium voltage conversion systems","high power semiconductor devices","magnetic component reduction","Steinmetz equation","dc- ac conversion system","loss estimation","apparent power 61.6 kVA","frequency 2 kHz"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays medium voltage conversion systems, like traction and energy distribution systems, aim to increase power density. Volume, weight and material reduction are gaining the market today. Due to the development of new high power semiconductor devices a new working frequency range is conceived, where magnetic component reduction is feasible. The core element of these new conversion systems is the medium frequency transformer. For an optimized design of the conversion system, the correct determination of transformer core losses is essential. Sinusoidal approaches, accurate enough for line frequency transformers, do not cope with the non-sinusoidal waveforms of future medium voltage conversion systems. In the past few years several empirical methods derived from the original Steinmetz equation have been introduced to determine magnetic core losses for non-sinusoidal waveforms. This paper proposes extended expressions for core loss determination in case of rectangular three level voltage waveforms, typical of high power converters. These expressions are compared in simulation and with experimental results obtained in the same conditions using a reduced scale dc-ac conversion system prototype that includes a 61.6 kVA/2 kHz transformer. It is shown that some of these techniques allow a considerable loss estimation accuracy (error below 12% for any ratio).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of empirical core loss evaluation methods for non-sinusoidally fed medium frequency power transformers","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677156","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677156.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of empirical core loss evaluation methods for non-sinusoidally fed medium frequency power transformers","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677156/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396147","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of empirical core loss evaluation methods for non-sinusoidally fed medium frequency power transformers","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066657S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4677157,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Luis Sanchez","affiliation":["Computer Technology Department, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Luis","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37651885300"},{"name":"Higinio Mora","affiliation":["Computer Technology Department, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain"],"firstName":"Higinio","lastName":"Mora","id":"37269458600"},{"name":"Jeronimo Mora","affiliation":["Computer Technology Department, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain"],"firstName":"Jeronimo","lastName":"Mora","id":"37651224000"},{"name":"Antonio Jimeno","affiliation":["Computer Technology Department, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Jimeno","id":"37662997600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677157","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance architecture for rotating decimal coordinates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital arithmetic","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","High performance computing","Delay","Humans","Proposals","Instruments","Calculators","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance architecture","decimal coordinates","radix-10 arithmetic","CORDIC method","decimal arithmetic","BCD operands","FPGA implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677157","abstract":"Although radix-10 arithmetic has been gaining renewed importance over the last few years, high performance decimal systems and techniques are still under development.

In this paper, a low cost localization system based on the measurements from a pedometer and communication ranging between neighboring nodes is presented. Unlike most of the existing methods that require good network connectivity, the proposed system works well in a sparse network. The localization information is obtained through a probability based algorithm that requires the solving of a nonlinear optimization problem. To obtain the optimum location of the sensor nodes, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) scheme that can be realized with a microcontroller for real time application is investigated in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields good performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396195","htmlLink":"/document/4677205/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimization approach for the localization of a wireless sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimization approach for the localization of a wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051893S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4677210,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel M.

This paper describes the validation of five dispatching algorithms for an elevator system that was implemented on Spartan 3 FGPA based boards in an integrated approach. The focus was on area reduction and performance improvement. The overall system is composed of several LCS, which implement the dispatching algorithms, an RS485 based network and a virtual environment called virtual elevator interface system (VEI). The latter includes a simulator/monitoring system and an EGCS based on fuzzy logic (FEGCS). The FEGCS runs on a PC and, under different traffic situations, determines the best algorithm to be run in each LCS reducing the user waiting time and the power consumption. The novelty of this approach is that the LCSs are capable to run several dispatching algorithms that are suitable for different passenger traffic situations, while the FEGCS only must determine the best algorithm to be run in each LCS. The VEI allows the designer to test and validate in a flexible way the algorithm performance for different traffic situations.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677210","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of dispatching algorithms for Local Control of Elevator Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of dispatching algorithms for Local Control of Elevator Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396200","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of dispatching algorithms for Local Control of Elevator Systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110585S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677214,"authors":[{"name":"V.

An usual distortion source on class-D amplifier is the bus-pumping effect. Bus-pumping causes characteristic distortion and introduces attenuation on output gain. Due to this effect the amplifier efficiency decreases. By including distortion factors on the Half-Bridge amplifier model a new feed-back active control (FBAC) is implemented. The FBAC minimizes distortion due to mid point DC-Bus voltage variations. Simulation and experimental results confirm the theoretical approach of parameter influence on Bus-Pumping, and the effectiveness of FBAC implemented control. Results show a clear reduction of generated distortion, which allows incremented audio amplifier efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677214","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677214.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"373","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feed-Back Active Control for Half-Bridge Class-D audio amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Feed-Back Active Control for Half-Bridge Class-D audio amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677214/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396204","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677214/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feed-Back Active Control for Half-Bridge Class-D audio amplifiers","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041761S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4677254,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan M.

The 3PCIS demodulates amplitude and phase of moving fringes in a scene frame by frame. Then, it is unwrapped in real-time to a sequence of projection angle maps based on an efficient use of spatial and temporal continuity of the phase maps.

Therefore developing of custom-built digital interfaces as well as digital data processing blocks and sometimes even integration of ADC converters into one integrated circuit is necessary. Due to the fact that developing an ASIC chip is expensive and laborious, the FPGA based solution should rather be used on the design stage of the algorithm. In this paper the application of FPGA in high performance DTC induction motor drive is presented. Few issues concerning the implementation of IM drive control structures in FPGA are discussed. The use of CORDIC algorithm for some mathematical operations in the DTC method is described. Experimental test results of this drive control structure realised in FPGA are demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless DTC control of the induction motor using FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677287","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677287.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless DTC control of the induction motor using FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677287/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396277","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless DTC control of the induction motor using FPGA","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073612S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4677289,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Distortion is mainly due to the nonlinear behavior of the output stage of the emitterpsilas power amplifier, in the form of saturation or memory effects. In order for these effects to be mitigated, a correction can be applied to input signals, causing them a distortion contrary to that occurring in the amplifier. In a previous paper, it has been demonstrated that segmented predistortion is an efficient solution to this problem in the case of gap-fillers for DVB-T. This paper presents the FPGA implementation of the segmented predistortion method. The suitability of currently available configurable devices for this kind of applications is discussed, and demonstrated by experimental results obtained in a real platform.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677314","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664822/4676877/04677314.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2008.4677314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4676877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of segmented predistorters for RF power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677314/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of segmented predistorters for RF power amplifiers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10396304","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677314/","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based implementation of segmented predistorters for RF power amplifiers","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04794S","chronDate":"June 30 2008-July 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664822","isNumber":"4676877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664822","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4676877","articleId":"4677314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4677329,"authors":[{"name":"Manus Henry","affiliation":["Oxford University, UK"],"firstName":"Manus","lastName":"Henry","id":"37339604800"},{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["Cergy-Pontoise University, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Monmasson","id":"37294192700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1665-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1666-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4677329","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Industrial control","Instruments","Control systems","Design automation","Design methodology","Refining","Sampling methods","Quantization","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drives","angular velocity control","CAD","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","industrial control","instrumentation","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","industrial control","instrumentation systems","CAD tools","current controllers","AC drives speed controller"]}],"abstract":"Short description of FPGAs and their CAD tools Design methodology issues: Algorithm refinement (sampling, quantization effects) Modularity (library of IP blocks) Systematic search for the best compromise between control performances and architectural constraints (see A3 section) Overview of contributions and limits of FPGAs has been proposed.

We use logic programming (LP) as the underlying computing machinery to encode the relations as rules and facts and compute with them. A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677352/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394634","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven Visual Analytics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven Visual Analytics","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085839S","chronDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669530","isNumber":"4677336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669530","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4677336","articleId":"4677352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4677358,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony C.

Ten participants were worked in pairs to complete a simulated real-world synthesis task using artifacts printed on cards on a large, paper-covered workspace. Experiment results indicate that groups use a number of different approaches to collaborative synthesis, and that they employ a variety of organizational metaphors to structure their information. It is further evident that establishing common ground and role assignment are critical aspects of collaborative synthesis.

There have been numerous empirical user studies testing the effectiveness of specific visual analytical tools.

In this paper, we present an approach for capturing and analyzing user interactions in a financial visual analytical tool and describe an exploratory user study that examines these interaction strategies. To achieve this goal, we created two visual tools to analyze raw interaction data captured during the user session. The results of this study demonstrate one possible strategy for understanding the relationship between interaction and reasoning both operationally and strategically.","doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677360","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669530/4677336/04677360.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2008.4677360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394642","htmlLink":"/document/4677360/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11122008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103902S","chronDate":"19-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669530","isNumber":"4677336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669530","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4677336","articleId":"4677360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4677362,"authors":[{"name":"Eric A.

We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive.

While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize userspsila visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems.

The traditional control method in the inner loop is transient current control and SPWM method in electrical locomotive. In this paper, Predictive current control and SVPWM method is presented in the inner loop to draw a sinusoidal line current from the wire. A voltage controller based on a proportional-integral scheme is used in the outer loop to obtain a constant DC-link voltage. A neutral point voltage compensator is proposed in the system to balance the capacitor voltages on the DC side.

For reducing influence which arose from modeling error, unknown model dynamics, parameter variation and disturbance acted on the velocity-loop, the NN controller is introduced to reduce the various influence mentioned above, adjust system to track the approximate velocity-loop reference model. In order to guarantee the stability of the system, updating algorithm of the weights of the NN controller and parameters of the MRAC are designed based on Lyapunov stability theory. Experiment results verify the proposed strategy can achieve high tracking precision for real-time position close-loop servo system.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677480","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677480.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new MRAC method based on neural network for high-precision servo system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new MRAC method based on neural network for high-precision servo system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10394297","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677480/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new MRAC method based on neural network for high-precision servo system","confLoc":"Harbin","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038908S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4677494,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Ting","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Ting","id":"37529469500"},{"name":"Zhengming Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292275500"},{"name":"Liqiang Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37380529100"},{"name":"Shuping Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."],"firstName":"Shuping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088420024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1848-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1849-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"4677494","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Capacitors","Open loop systems","Pulse width modulation converters","Power electronics","Energy storage","Switching converters","Power system simulation","Power system reliability","Electromagnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","power convertors","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instantaneous energy balancing","three-level neutral point clamped converters","power electronics conversion","electromagnetic field method","electromagnetic energy transmission","electromagnetic field theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic Energy","Three-Level NPC Converter","Energy Storage Component","Switching Device","Research Method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677494","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677494.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous energy balancing in three-level neutral point clamped converters","abstract":"Instantaneous energy balancing plays an important role in power electronics conversion.

However, one of their disadvantages is the inherent cogging torque, which is a kind of torque ripple and always desirable to minimize. Six analytical models for cogging torque prediction are presented and compared in this paper. These analytical models are progressively refined and differ in methods for calculating the permeance due to stator slotting (i.e. with/without considering the slot leakage), the airgap field distribution due to permanent magnets (i.e. with/without considering the inter-pole leakage and/or curvature effect), and the cogging torque (based on the energy method or the net lateral force acting on the stator teeth). Developed analytical models are used to predict the cogging torque waveforms, the optimal magnet pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio and the optimal slot opening in three machines having different combinations of slot number and pole number, viz. 18/24, 9/8, and 24/16, respectively, and are extensively validated by the finite element analyses. It shows that accounting for the slot leakage and/or magnet interpole leakage can significantly improve the accuracy of cogging torque prediction, while the method for predicting the cogging torque based on the calculation of net lateral force acting on the stator teeth exhibits a higher accuracy than that based on the energy method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of alternate analytical models for predicting cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet machines","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677557","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677557.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of alternate analytical models for predicting cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet machines","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677557/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394374","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of alternate analytical models for predicting cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet machines","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092223S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4677567,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyun Liu","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"lastName":"Xinyun Liu","id":"37088027952"},{"name":"Nicolas Fournier","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Fournier","id":"37872511800"},{"name":"Andrew J.

An ultra-capacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power since it can be used with high C-rates. Active battery/ultra-capacitor hybrid model provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be less than ultra-capacitor, which will result in cost and size reduction of the battery pack. The power management is provided using a boost and a bidirectional DC/DC converter. The performance of the developed model and its control strategy is tested under various driving cycles.

The permanent magnet machines optimization must respect multiple constraints. Efficiency and weight have a large influence on the design. These two constraints can be found in several vehicular applications: propulsion motors, electrical fans for combustion engine, driving motors for ancillaries, driving motors for air-circuit fuel-cell compressor...Indeed, in all those embedded applications, the efficiency must be maximal to limit the energy consumption and the mass or the volume must be as low as possible. In this paper, the authors focus on an original multi-objective optimization algorithm well adapted to the previous problem. The method is based on multiplying runs of a new genetic algorithm specialized in broadly covering the solution space around target objectives. This algorithm is an improved variant of previously developed algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms was proven by comparing with a deterministic algorithm (SQP) and a reference multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The presented algorithm is first validated on a study case from the literature: the dimensioning of a slotless permanent magnet machine. Then experimental results of the complete method applied on a permanent magnet motor are highlighted in a multi-objective point of view.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677611/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10394428","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677611/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Permanent magnet motor multiobjective optimization using multiple runs of an evolutionary algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permanent magnet motor multiobjective optimization using multiple runs of an evolutionary algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051159S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4677635,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolan Wu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Xiaolan Wu","id":"37087348694"},{"name":"Binggang Cao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Binggang Cao","id":"37087184570"},{"name":"Jianping Wen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Wen","id":"37087185749"},{"name":"Yansheng Bian","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yansheng Bian","id":"37088038480"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1848-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1849-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"4677635","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":957},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Hybrid electric vehicles","Fuel economy","Iron","Power generation","Hybrid power systems","Energy storage","Petroleum","Engines","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","engines","fuel economy","hybrid electric vehicles","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","plug-in hybrid electric vehicle control strategy","energy storage systems","charge-depletion operation period","petroleum consumption","vehicle engine fuel economy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","Control Strategy","Fuel consumption","Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677635","abstract":"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) differ from hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with their ability to use off-board electricity generation to recharge their energy storage systems. In addition to possessing charge-sustaining HEV operation capability, PHEVs use the stored electrical energy during a charge-depleting (CD) operating period to displace a significant amount of petroleum consumption. The choice of CD operating strategy directly influences the benefit derived from the PHEV technology. This paper describes the application of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the optimization of the control parameters in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). In this study, based on CD operating strategy, the fitness function is defined so as to maximize the vehicle engine fuel economy (FE). The driving performance requirements are then considered as constraints. The results from the computer simulation show the effectiveness of the approach and improvement in fuel economy (FE) while ensuring that the vehicle performance is not sacrificed.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677635","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677635.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle control strategy parameter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677635/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle control strategy parameter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677635/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10394452","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle control strategy parameter","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042055S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4677669,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Cao","affiliation":["Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Cao","id":"37654452500"},{"name":"Nigel Schofield","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Nigel","lastName":"Schofield","id":"37270771600"},{"name":"Ali Emadi","affiliation":["Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Emadi","id":"37273794700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1848-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1849-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"4677669","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":376,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":10154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677669","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Voltage","Nickel","Lithium","Power electronics","USA Councils","Temperature","Costs","Circuit topology","Thermal management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regenerative braking","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery balancing methods","electric vehicles","battery system life","regenerative braking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery","Balancing","Review"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677669","endPage":"6","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Battery balancing methods: A comprehensive review","abstract":"The trend toward more electric vehicles has demanded the need for high voltage, high efficiency and long life battery systems. A complete battery system consists of the following parts: protection, management and balancing. Of the three parts, balancing is the most important concerning the life of the battery system because without the balancing system, the individual cell voltages will drift apart over time. The capacity of the total pack will also decrease more quickly during operation which will result in the fail of the total battery system. This condition is especially severe when the battery has a long string of cells (high voltage battery systems) and frequent regenerative braking (charging) is done via the battery pack. This paper presents the theory behind the proposed balancing methods for battery systems within the past twenty years.

However, current challenges for fuel cells such as high cost, sizing problem, and limited driving range, greatly affect the pace of FCV development. At the same time, domestic and renewable energy resource usage is frequently being encouraged for future electric propulsion applications. This philosophy has lead auto manufacturers to investigate the potential of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this paper, a fuel cell based PHEV (FC-PHEV) configuration, powered by combining an on-board regenerative fuel cell (RFC) and down-sized Ni-MH batteries, is modeled and investigated in detail. This configuration prospectively points towards remarkable advantages from the point of view of both environmental as well as cost friendliness. In addition, an FC-PHEV will also depict longer life span, while maintaining good vehicle performance, compared to regular plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) or fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FC-HEVs). This paper will present a power train configuration of a FC-PHEV, developed for a family sedan. A suitable power management approach has been developed, which considers fuel economy, component efficiency, and driving pattern. The vehicle performance and feasibility are also investigated based on the modeling and simulation studies. A detailed comparison and discussion from the point of view of fuel economy, drive train efficiency, as well as practical cost and commercialization issues will also be presented.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677706","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel design and feasibility analysis of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel design and feasibility analysis of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394523","htmlLink":"/document/4677706/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel design and feasibility analysis of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4677738,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

These parameters include the split ratio of the inner diameter to outer diameter of the stator, the stator tooth width, the stator magnet thickness, the stator back-iron thickness, the stator lamination bridge, the rotor tooth width and height, and the rotor back-iron thickness. In addition, the influence of the shape of the magnets and the rotor teeth has been investigated. It shows that the FSPM machine having equal stator tooth width, stator magnet thickness and slot opening produces the maximum output torque. The torque can be increased if the stator back-iron thickness is reduced to ~70% of the stator tooth width to increase the slot area. The output torque can be increased by ~8% if the rotor tooth width is increased by 40%~60%. The optimal split ratio for maximum output torque is ~0.55-0.6 when the copper loss is fixed to 50 W and increases with an increase in the copper loss. The influence of other design parameters is found to be less significant for an appropriately designed motor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of design parameters on output torque of flux-switching permanent magnet machines","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677782","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663469/4677399/04677782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Influence of design parameters on output torque of flux-switching permanent magnet machines","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677782/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10394599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of design parameters on output torque of flux-switching permanent magnet machines","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071345S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663469","isNumber":"4677399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663469","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4677399","articleId":"4677782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4677914,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37635674700"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677914","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"abstract":"This paper proposes a two-hop proportional fairness scheduling scheme for relay based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) systems.

In this paper, we investigate the power controlled DS-CDMA reverse-link performance under soft handover with convolutional coding scheme. It is shown that system under soft handover has less sensitivity against incrementing the number of users. The effect of the link balance is evaluated through simulation by considering the reverse-link behavior with power control and soft handover. It observed that the differential loss between two links under soft handover decreases the uplink performance. Finally it is pointed out that by using convolutional error correction coding scheme an additional gain is obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis in SIR-Based Power Controlled Uplink DS-CDMA Systems using Soft Handover Technique with Convolutional Coding Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Control systems","Multiaccess communication","Convolutional codes","Power control","Base stations","Fading","Diversity reception","Multipath channels","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","convolutional codes","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power controlled uplink","DS-CDMA systems","soft handover technique","convolutional coding scheme","error correction coding scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis in SIR-Based Power Controlled Uplink DS-CDMA Systems using Soft Handover Technique with Convolutional Coding Scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677918/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345362","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis in SIR-Based Power Controlled Uplink DS-CDMA Systems using Soft Handover Technique with Convolutional Coding Scheme","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07808S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677920,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Li","affiliation":["Intel Communication Technology Lab (Beijing), Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Li","id":"37880680200"},{"name":"Guanjie Li","affiliation":["Intel Communication Technology Lab (Beijing), Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Guanjie","lastName":"Li","id":"38560054800"},{"name":"Feng Zhou","affiliation":["Intel Communication Technology Lab (Beijing), Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37877626900"},{"name":"Yang Gao","affiliation":["Intel Communication Technology Lab (Beijing), Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37291884900"},{"name":"May Wu","affiliation":["Intel Communication Technology Lab (Beijing), Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"May","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290739000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677920","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Base stations","Decoding","Digital relays","Interference","Mobile communication","Power system relaying","Antennas and propagation","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop MIMO relay","random beamforming","cellular system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on point-to-multipoint relaying in cellular system.

The routing strategy for each user is important design parameter because the terminal is energy-limited. To enhance the radio resource utility, a utility maximization framework via pricing is adopted for multi-cell distributed power allocation. Under the optimization physical layer transmission strategy, an efficient power-based routing algorithm is proposed in reverse link which selects the best route in the tradeoff between power consumption and data rate. It is demonstrated through intensive system-level simulation that the performance of our proposed routing algorithm is superior to several known routing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.13","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677922.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Based Routing for Two-Hop OFDMA Cellular Networks with Fixed Relay Stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677922/","displayDocTitle":"Power-Based Routing for Two-Hop OFDMA Cellular Networks with Fixed Relay Stations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10355985","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677922/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Based Routing for Two-Hop OFDMA Cellular Networks with Fixed Relay Stations","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-009RPL.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035854S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677924,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Saghaei","affiliation":["Department of Elect.

By combining such LS-CDMA technology with the space-time coding technology, space-time spread spectrum LS-CDMA system can get more advantages such as spatial diversity when more than one antennas are installed in the system. Both the transmitter scheme and the receiver structure of such space-time spread spectrum LS-CDMA system using multiple transmitting antennas and only one receiving antenna are put forward in this paper.

The relays are in decoded-and-forward (DF) mode. Hybrid automatic repeated request (HARQ) is employed in the network to exploit time diversity gain by combining multiple transmissions. In the first phase, the transmission is just traditional HARQ scheme. If one of the relays detects received packets successfully, it forwards regenerated signals in the second phase. When at least two of the relays obtain error-free packets after decoding, two of the relays are selected to forward regenerated signals in Alamouti scheme. The pairwise error probability (PEP) performances of the two phases are analyzed, especially that in the second phase. A closed form expression is given by a specific function. The total packet error rate (PER) is given by defining the decoding function D. The simulation results prove the proposed scheme improves system reliability considerably.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.23","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677932.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Transmission Scheme with Relay Selection and HARQ in Decoded-and-Forward Mode of Cooperative Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677932/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Transmission Scheme with Relay Selection and HARQ in Decoded-and-Forward Mode of Cooperative Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10355994","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677932/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Transmission Scheme with Relay Selection and HARQ in Decoded-and-Forward Mode of Cooperative Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06567S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677941,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiming Zheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Ruiming","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37529064500"},{"name":"Ming Yan","firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yan","id":"37087287534"},{"name":"Xi Li","firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37087204399"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677941","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Interference cancellation","Equalizers","Throughput","Performance analysis","Physical layer","Receiving antennas","Analytical models","Modulation coding","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system performance evaluation","advanced techniques","cdma2000"]}],"abstract":"The system of cdma2000 1x EV-DO is introduced to provide fast and efficient broadband wireless access.

In order to evaluate the DO network performance, the system level simulation is considered based on appropriate assumptions and parameters. Four hot advanced techniques, the distributed token bucket rate control mechanism, reverse link interference cancellation, forward link equalizer and multi-carrier, are deployed and judged in the existing EV-DO system. From simulation analysis and discussions, dual receive antennas, equalizer and interference cancellation may improve the average sector throughput in forward and reverse link respectively.

Both the analytical prediction and the simulation results show that the worst case performance loss can be less than 0.25 dB if we drop half of the quantization bit-width.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677952/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Low Memory Design for Hybrid-ARQ Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Memory Design for Hybrid-ARQ Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049726S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4677957,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhai Shi","affiliation":["SARFT, Chang'an University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhai","lastName":"Shi","id":"37877326100"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["SARFT, Chang'an University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37535641700"},{"name":"Ju Ma","affiliation":["SARFT, Chang'an University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Ma","id":"37881086100"},{"name":"Rui Lv","affiliation":["Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Lv","id":"37394100800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677957","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Digital video broadcasting","TV broadcasting","Parity check codes","Artificial satellites","Code standards","Forward error correction","Protocols","Telecommunication standards","Encapsulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","direct broadcasting by satellite","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced broadcasting system-satellite","service versatility","satellite digital broadcasting","low density parity check codes","digital video broadcasting","DVB-S2","TV contribution links","digital satellite news gathering","CCM working mode","VCM working mode","ACM working mode"]}],"abstract":"The paper describes a new generation satellite broadcasting system in China named Advanced Broadcasting System-Satellite (ABS-S) that offers system performance and service versatility suitable for future satellite digital broadcasting. The new system utilizes variable rate, constant size single LDPC codes to allow all satellite applications supplied by DVB-S2 system, including: TV and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. Meanwhile the new system utilizes fixed frame structure to realize the CCM, VCM and ACM working modes adopted by DVB-S2 system to further simplify the complexity of the implementation. The paper provides a tutorial overview of the ABS-S system, describing its main features and performance. A prototype system has been implemented based on the proposed protocol. Results from both lab tests and field trials demonstrate significant performance advantages of the new design over existing satellite broadcasting system DVB-S and almost the same performance as the second generation satellite broadcasting system DVB-S2.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.48","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677957.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Generation Satellite Broadcasting System in China: Advanced Broadcasting System-Satellite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677957/","displayDocTitle":"A New Generation Satellite Broadcasting System in China: Advanced Broadcasting System-Satellite","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356017","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677957/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Generation Satellite Broadcasting System in China: Advanced Broadcasting System-Satellite","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041461S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4677958,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabin Liu","firstName":"Jiabin","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677958","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"The proposed Grade of Service based Call Admission Control (GoS-CAC) algorithm in the next generation mobile communications system operates a threshold comparison, which integrates many factors that affect the decision accuracy of a CAC scheme such as system traffic loads, quality of service (QoS) requirements, channel quality, interference level, system GoS and user handoff, etc. The GoS-CAC algorithm cooperates subtly with a power control and data rate adjustment scheme making able fast, accurate, adaptive threshold, simple and feasible decision-making about incoming calls for next generation mobile communications systems.

paper, we give an investigation on the performance of cellular dual-hop cooperative communication systems with regenerative relays over flat Rayleigh fading channels. M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) is considered. Two linear diversity reception techniques are adopted in the destination, i.e.,maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC).We first derive the symbol error rate (SER) expression of dual hop communication with MRC scheme and all relays randomly distributed between the source and the destination. We then derive asymptotic SER expression. With the aid of the a symptotic analysis, asymptotic-optimal power allocation(A-OPA) strategy provides more significant performance improvement compared to equal power allocation (EPA) strategy. Next, we analyze the performance and the asymptotic performance of dual-hop communication with SC scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677970/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345369","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Performance Study of Multi-Node System in Wireless Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Performance Study of Multi-Node System in Wireless Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034328S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4677971,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyuan Rao","affiliation":["Sch. of Electron.

Simulations indicate that the Amplify- and-Forward (AF) protocol beats the Decode-and-Forward (DF) protocol under all these three combining methods. To combine the incoming signals the channel quality should be estimated as well as possible, more estimation accuracy requires more resource. A very simple combining method can obtain the performance compared with that by optimal combining methods approximately.

All these three combining methods for both diversity protocols can achieve the maximum diversity order.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677971/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356028","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Performance of Combining Methods for Three-Node Cooperative Diversity Wireless Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Performance of Combining Methods for Three-Node Cooperative Diversity Wireless Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046289S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677974,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Guo Zhang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Li-Guo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37696169300"},{"name":"Jun-Gang Han","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Jun-Gang","lastName":"Han","id":"37692979600"},{"name":"Hui-Min Du","firstName":"Hui-Min","lastName":"Du","id":"37687198100"},{"name":"Peng Hao","firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Hao","id":"37087975606"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677974","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677974","abstract":"This paper presents a case study of the complete baseband part of basestation that is designed and implemented using ring network on chip (ftNoC). By combining general-purpose and application-specific hardware, it is possible to integrate the complete baseband part of TD-SCDMA basestation on a single chip. In ftNoC, links are divided into two groups of ring, one of them used for fault-tolerance. Each group contains a control-ring and a data-ring. Control-ring propagates routing, link error and error control information of all nodes by packet-switching and data-ring propagates data by circuit-switching. Ring network adopts time-division multiplexing (TDM) and priority mechanism to implement space division multiplexing (SDM) of bandwidth and fair routing. Simulation results show the baseband part of TD-SCDMA designed using ftNoC perfectly accords with the requirement of TD-SCDMA at a network clock frequency of 200 MHz. And the architecture can efficiently avoid traffic congestion, deadlock and starvation and ensure full use of bandwidth.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Network-on-a-chip","Baseband","Routing","Error correction","Bandwidth","Hardware","Fault tolerance","Circuits","Time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","circuit switching","code division multiple access","data communication","network topology","network-on-chip","packet switching","space division multiplexing","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-SCDMA basestation","ring network-on-chip","baseband part","general-purpose hardware","application-specific hardware","fault tolerance","control ring","data ring","packet switching","circuit switching","time division multiplexing","space division multiplexing","fair routing","traffic congestion"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.65","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677974.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of TD-SCDMA Basestation Using Ring Network on Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of TD-SCDMA Basestation Using Ring Network on Chip","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10356031","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677974/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of TD-SCDMA Basestation Using Ring Network on Chip","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039968S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677975,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Saghaei","affiliation":["Department of Elect.

This algorithm is compared with fixed-step, variable step and adaptive step closed-loop power control with decision feedback (FSPC-DF, VSPC-DF and ASPC-DF, respectively). Numerical results indicate that NAPC-DF algorithm, under fading can significantly improve the radio network capacity without any increase in power control signaling.

By taking advantage of the approximate probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the harmonic mean of two independent exponential random variables, we obtain a closed-form SEP formulation for the AF cooperation system with M-PSK and M- QAM signals, respectively. Moreover, an approximation is presented which is asymptotically tight at high SNR. Based on the asymptotically tight SEP approximation, an OPA is provided to minimize the SEP under the total power constraints. It turns out that the optimal allocation for AF cooperation system is not dependent on the modulation modes and the direct link between the source and the destination, but it depends only on the links related to the relays.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.71","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677980.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEP Analysis and Optimal Power Allocation of Multi-Node Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"SEP Analysis and Optimal Power Allocation of Multi-Node Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677980/","accessionNumber":"10356034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677980/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEP Analysis and Optimal Power Allocation of Multi-Node Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045496S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677984,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37629991700"},{"name":"Furong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Furong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403436900"},{"name":"Lai Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Lai","lastName":"Tu","id":"37391074200"},{"name":"Kewei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Kewei","lastName":"Li","id":"37403408100"},{"name":"Sacko Diouba","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Sacko","lastName":"Diouba","id":"37658910400"},{"name":"Ibrahim khider","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"khider","id":"37703759700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677984","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile antennas","Antenna arrays","Relays","3G mobile communication","Wireless LAN","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Mutual information","MIMO","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","cellular radio","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic virtual antenna arrays","optimal relay mobile terminals selection","cooperative diversity","ad-hoc networks","cellular networks","multiple relay mobile terminals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677984","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677984.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Virtual Antenna Array with Optimal Relay Mobile Terminals Selection","abstract":"Most literature about cooperative diversity focus on ad-hoc networks.

However there is another possible way that collisions can be avoided, that is by getting some help from physical layer technologies. It has been proved that multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology with spatial multiplexing (SM) operating in a rich scattering environment can resolve up to M different data streams where M is the minimum number of transmitting or receiving antennas. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of slotted ALOHA access protocol employing MIMO with SM. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight and directions for developing access protocol to fully utilise benefits of MIMO technology from the network point of view. We evaluate an upper bound performance in terms of efficiency (success rate) and corresponding capacity utilisation efficiency, collision rate, and an average number of successful transmissions per slot. We find a substantial gain in efficiency in comparison with the conventional slotted ALOHA. However, we also discover that an additional gain is diminished when more antennas at the receiver are included. Mathematical derivations followed by numerical simulations and discussion are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slotted ALOHA with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.80","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Slotted ALOHA with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677989/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356042","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slotted ALOHA with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.214186S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4677990,"authors":[{"name":"Toufiqul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Toufiqul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37285829400"},{"name":"Md.

A time domain equalizer (TEQ) is necessary at the receiver front head to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI). Melsa, Younce, and Rohrs (1996) proposed the most popular MSSNR channel shortening method for single input single output (SISO) channels based on minimizing the energy of the shortened impulse response (SIR) outside the target window while keeping the energy inside constant. Because of computational simplicity of the MSSNR method, we extended this method directly for MIMO channels unlike other MIMO TEQ design methods which perform shortening in multiple stages. We compared our scheme with other MIMO TEQ design techniques for equalization SNR energy compaction ratio, signal to interference plus noise ratio and bit rate. The results show significant improvement over some reported techniques.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.81","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On MIMO Channel Shortening For Cyclic-Prefixed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677990/","displayDocTitle":"On MIMO Channel Shortening For Cyclic-Prefixed Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356043","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4677990/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MIMO Channel Shortening For Cyclic-Prefixed Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042081S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4677991,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhao","affiliation":["College of Physics Science and Technology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402333800"},{"name":"Zhenyu Hu","affiliation":["College of Physics Science and Technology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37635472000"},{"name":"Kuixi Yin","affiliation":["College of Physics Science and Technology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kuixi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37410701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677991","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO","Maximum likelihood detection","Block codes","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Equations","Space technology","Iterative algorithms","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","maximum likelihood detection","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind detection","MIMO systems","maximum likelihood estimate","space-time block code system","finite calculation","error reduction"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides an advanced method of blind detection based on maximum likelihood estimate, and the scheme can be applied to MIMO systems.

First, an adaptive transmission principle for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems is presented under the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver; Furthermore, we propose not only an adaptive modulation scheme for different transmit antennas but also an adaptive scheme which combines channel encoding and modulation. Finally we demonstrate from the simulation that the proposed scheme is of practical significance since it provides a well-behaved tradeoff between the ASE and complexity in comparison with the singular value decomposition (SVD) based adaptive transmission scheme with the optimal ASE performance and high computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.86","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04677995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Adaptive Transmission Scheme for Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Adaptive Transmission Scheme for Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4677995/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356048","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4677995/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Adaptive Transmission Scheme for Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068805S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4677995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4677996,"authors":[{"name":"Wendong Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290576900"},{"name":"Chengkang Pan","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chengkang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37292691000"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4677996","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Decoding","Resource management","Transmitters","Feedback","Protocols","Performance gain","Narrowband","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel coding","decoding","MIMO communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel transmission scheme","MIMO relay channel","half-duplex decode-and-forward relay transmission","direct transmission","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"A novel transmission scheme that mixes half-duplex decode-and-forward relay transmission (RT) with direct transmission (DT) is proposed for a MIMO relay channel.

In general, the popular minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver can be employed due to its good performance and amenability to adaptive implementation. However, it is not optimal in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance. In this proposed approach, the main idea is to directly minimize the BER by employing an particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm on the estimated BER function in order to adaptively adjust the weights of the MBER detectors. Simulation results demonstrate that this adaptive minimum- BER detection using PSO algorithm (MBER-PSO) can achieve significantly superior performance, which is very close to that of the optimal maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678002.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Minimum-BER Detection for MIMO Systems with Time-Reversal Space-Time Block Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Block codes","Bit error rate","Detectors","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency","Particle swarm optimization","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MIMO communication","particle swarm optimisation","radio receivers","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-in-multiple-out systems","MIMO systems","particle swarm optimization","minimum BER detection","time-reversal space-time block codes","adaptive minimum bit error rate","minimum mean square error receiver","MMSE receiver","maximum-likelihood sequence estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Minimum-BER Detection for MIMO Systems with Time-Reversal Space-Time Block Codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678002/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356055","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Minimum-BER Detection for MIMO Systems with Time-Reversal Space-Time Block Codes","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039985S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678003,"authors":[{"name":"Desong Bian","affiliation":["Electronic engineering Apartment, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjian, China"],"firstName":"Desong","lastName":"Bian","id":"37870869200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678003","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Space technology","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo channel estimation method","space-time communication system","MAP iterative algorithm","soft-decision information","SISO channel decoders"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678003","abstract":"In order to improve the accuracy of channel estimation in MIMO space-time communication system, a turbo channel estimation which employs MAP iterative algorithm is proposed.

Simulation results show that high capacity gain can be achieved by the proposed scheme compared with direct transmission in most cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Relaying Transmission in Correlated MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.95","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678004.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Relaying Transmission in Correlated MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678004/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356057","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Relaying Transmission in Correlated MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052299S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678005,"authors":[{"name":"Mo Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Li","id":"37597508900"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678005","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","MIMO","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Delay","Round robin","Diversity reception","Samarium","Base stations","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer packet scheduling scheme","low-complexity antenna selection algorithm","multiservice MIMO system","utility function","delay proportional fairness scheduling algorithm","QoS guarantee","real-time service","nonreal-time service","system throughput"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a cross-layer packet scheduling scheme for multi-service MIMO system which adopts a unified method to select the set of users to transmit to and the antennas over which users send their packets. Our proposed scheduling scheme makes a difference between RT(real time) and non-RT (non-real time) services. It defines the utility functions of RT services according to a modified delay PF algorithm (MDPF), which could guarantee the QoS of RT services while combining the predominance of PF algorithm. And PF mapping is used for calculate the utility functions of non-RT services considering the tradeoff between throughput and fairness. Through a low-complexity antenna selection algorithm, set of users and antennas are determined at the same time according to the utility functions of every user.

Simulation results show that this scheme enhances the user's outage performance and reduces the sensitivity to the imperfect CSI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Channel state information","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas","Broadcasting","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Linear antenna arrays","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel capacity","channel estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation scheme","linear MIMO beamforming","imperfect channel state information","MIMO broadcast channel","channel estimation error"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.103","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678012.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Power Allocation Scheme for Linear MIMO Beamforming with Imperfect Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Power Allocation Scheme for Linear MIMO Beamforming with Imperfect Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678012/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678012/","accessionNumber":"10356064","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Power Allocation Scheme for Linear MIMO Beamforming with Imperfect Channel State Information","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044029S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4678013,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292620100"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678013","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Estimation error","Feedback","Delay estimation","Channel estimation","Error analysis","Vector quantization","Feeds","Transmitters","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Doppler effect","mean square error methods","multi-access systems","vector quantisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming capacity bounds","MISO time-selective channels","estimation errors","feedback delay","multiple-input single-output time-selective channel","channel estimation error","delayed limited feedback","minimum mean squared error estimation","codebook","random vector quantization design","Doppler spread"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678013","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.104","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"We examine the ergodic capacity of beamforming over a multiple-input single-output (MISO) time-selective channel with channel estimation error and delayed limited feedback.

However, there is a gap between UE's signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and that required by the MCS. In this paper, we propose a novel power loading algorithm using the SINR gap. The algorithm converts the SINR gap into the transmit power gap among different streams. Thus BS adjusts transmit power allocation for different streams and selects higher MCS than that without adjusting power. The results demonstrate that this proposed algorithm contributes large gain of SE for single user (SU-) MIMO based on singular value decomposition (SVD) preceding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Power Loading Algorithm for Downlink Multiple Streams MIMO System","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.105","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel Power Loading Algorithm for Downlink Multiple Streams MIMO System","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678014/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356066","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Power Loading Algorithm for Downlink Multiple Streams MIMO System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052681S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4678015,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Zhu","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Inf.

In this paper, a spatial multiplexing scheme and a cooperative beamforming scheme have been proposed for a non-regenerative MIMO relay system. In the spatial multiplexing scheme, the MIMO relay channel can be decomposed into several parallel channels each with the source to relay channel gain and the relay to destination channel gain. In the cooperative beamforming scheme, the transmitter uses all of its antennas to transmit one signal instead of multiplexing different signals simultaneously. It can be proved that the capacity of the spatial multiplexing scheme is smaller than that of the cooperative beamforming scheme in the low SNR regime. It is shown that for asymptotically large number of relays, the capacity of the spatial multiplexing scheme is converging to that of the beamforming scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compare Beamforming with Multiplexing for Mimo Relay Network in the Low SNR Regime","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.106","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compare Beamforming with Multiplexing for Mimo Relay Network in the Low SNR Regime","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678015/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356067","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compare Beamforming with Multiplexing for Mimo Relay Network in the Low SNR Regime","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043572S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678016,"authors":[{"name":"Weibin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weibin","lastName":"Li","id":"37404622700"},{"name":"Tingchang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tingchang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403873200"},{"name":"Xiufeng Lan","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiufeng","lastName":"Lan","id":"37396622800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678016","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Feedback","Covariance matrix","Statistics","Design methodology","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Physics","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","covariance matrices","Huffman codes","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined codebook constructing method","correlated MIMO channels","multiple-input multiple-output channels","transmit covariance matrix","Monte Carlo simulations","optimal beamforming","Huffman coding","feedback rate","correlated MIMO system"]}],"abstract":"A combined codebook constructing method is proposed for beamforming in correlated Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, where the codebook is dynamically constructed based on the transmit covariance matrix of the channel.

In specific channel environment, if coherent bandwidth and single sub-carrier bandwidth is known, we can choose the shift parameters for bridge function sequence to get the best frequency diversity. At the same time, the cochannel interference is decreased and the system channel capacity is improved. On the basis of discussing the difference between bridge function's discrete spreading and traditional discrete spreading, the traditional discrete spreading mode is modified and extended. The new spread spectrum mode will be more flexible and can be adapted to the complex variable channel. And the better frequency diversity can be achieved with various channel environments.

Our analytical results indict that in the adaptive modulation system, TAS with the Alamouti scheme can obtain higher spectral efficiency compared with OSTBC without antenna selection.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.118","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Modulation in MIMO System using Transmit Antenna Selection with Alamouti Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Modulation in MIMO System using Transmit Antenna Selection with Alamouti Scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678027/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356079","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678027/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Modulation in MIMO System using Transmit Antenna Selection with Alamouti Scheme","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044901S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678028,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Sun","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37877950300"},{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"},{"name":"Sheng Meng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Meng","id":"37874503000"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678028","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Power system relaying","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Power system modeling","Protective relaying","System performance","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","resource allocation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO relay channel","optimal power allocation","decode and forward relay","path loss","transmitting antennas","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the capacity of MIMO relay channel with decode and forward (DF) scheme is investigated, where each node within the system quipped with multiple antennas and located in an environment with distance-dependent path loss.

This provides a new paradigm for transmission over Rayleigh fading channels where scattering phenomenon is a major obstruction. At the transmitter side data encoded using a space-time block code, and the encoded data is split into n streams which are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. At the receiver side we employ different equalization and detection techniques to obtain optimum BER. The detection algorithms that we have tried out are zero-forcing, MMSE, maximum a posteriori, maximum likelihood, nulling and cancellation using QR factorization and iterative MMSE. We review the encoding and decoding algorithms for various codes and provide simulation results demonstrating their performance. It is shown that using multiple transmit antennas and space-time block coding provides remarkable performance at the expense of almost no extra processing. It is also seen different detecting algorithms are optimized for different fading environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678032.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Multi Stage Receivers for Coded Signals in MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Block codes","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms","Rayleigh scattering","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Noise cancellation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel coding","electromagnetic wave scattering","equalisers","error statistics","interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","multistage receiver","MIMO channel","space time block coded signal","multiinput multioutput channel","Rayleigh fading channel","scattering phenomenon","encoding","receive antenna","channel equalization","BER","zero-forcing algorithm","maximum a posteriori detection algorithm","maximum likelihood detection algorithm","QR factorization","iterative MMSE","decoding","multiple transmit antenna","nulling-cancellation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Multi Stage Receivers for Coded Signals in MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356082","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Multi Stage Receivers for Coded Signals in MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055793S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678033,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Space Microwave Technology, Xi''an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087756074"},{"name":"Minqi Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Space Microwave Technology, Xi''an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Minqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37878813900"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Space Microwave Technology, Xi''an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089082505"},{"name":"Quan Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Space Microwave Technology, Xi''an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089109579"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678033","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678033","abstract":"In this paper, we study the effect of channel estimation error at the receiver on the mutual information of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel obeying correlated Rayleigh fading.

years, due to the increasing demand of the data transmission rate, a lot of research based on Multiple- Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system is established. MIMO systems can increase the system capacity and improve transmission reliability. However, the multiple RF chains associated with multiple antennas are costly in terms of size, power and hardware. Antenna selection techniques have been applied in MIMO system design to reduce the system complexity and cost. In this paper, we consider two schemes of antenna selection in correlated Rayleigh channels i.e. the maximal ratio transmission and Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code technique. The simulation results illustrate that; the new antenna selection scheme can obtain performance close to the optimum selection with low computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10356090","htmlLink":"/document/4678042/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection for MIMO Systems in Correlated Channels with Diversity Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection for MIMO Systems in Correlated Channels with Diversity Technique","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055622S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4678044,"authors":[{"name":"Junqi Guo","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junqi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37713538200"},{"name":"Shubo Ren","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shubo","lastName":"Ren","id":"37721791500"},{"name":"Haige Xiang","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haige","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37271811200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678044","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Iterative algorithms","State estimation","Bit error rate","MIMO","Discrete Fourier transforms","Least squares approximation","Transmitters","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interference suppression","iterative methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncyclic prefixed MIMO-OFDM system","recursive algorithm","joint channel estimation","data detection","block-type pilot sequence","interference cancellation","bit error rate","iterative LS channel estimation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We propose in this paper a non-cyclic prefixed multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (non-cp MIMO-OFDM) system based on a recursive algorithm of joint channel estimation and data detection.

And the synchronization performances in MIMO channel are super to those in SISO channel for its larger diversity gain.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.137","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Coarse Time Synchronization Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Coarse Time Synchronization Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678046/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356094","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678046/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Coarse Time Synchronization Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032989S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4678047,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, Institute of Communication Engineering of PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404160100"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, Institute of Communication Engineering of PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, Institute of Communication Engineering of PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678047","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Feedback","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","OFDM","MIMO","Radio transmitters","Quality of service","Wireless communication","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","packet switching","precoding","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding","partial feedback","multiuser system","MIMO system","OFDM system","MIMO channel","single-input single-output channel","radio resource","space-time-frequency","packet scheduling","resource allocation","feedback channel state information","quality of service","packet drop rate","packet delay","system throughput"]}],"abstract":"A cross-layer design based on precoding and partial feedback for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems is presented in this paper.

According to characteristics of various traffics in actual networks, four types of traffics are classified. Different class has different QoS requirements and one connection only belongs to one class. Considering MAC QoS requirements, PHY channel side information (CSI) and connection fairness, the scheduling priority factor (SPF) is defined for each connection. Based on the scheduling priority factor, the suboptimal solutions for the formulated problem are obtained. Packets from different connections are queued at the base station.

Thus, the rapid growth in traffic volume and increase in new services has begun to change the configuration and structure of wireless networks. In the past, WiMAX has gained lot of interest for providing broadband communication. The present demand in the field of wireless communication is not only to provide data communication when the user is mobile, but also to provide high data rate by consuming less bandwidth. To meet these requirements, WiMAX provides specification for FEC (forward error correction), and optional schemes like advanced antenna systems (AAS), space time code (STC) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. Also it includes two MIMO profiles, which can be used for different purposes including diversity, spatial multiplexing and interference reduction. MIMO in conjunction with OFDMA promises to provide massive amelioration in system throughput. The objective of the paper is to propound a unified guideline for choosing optimal schemes for different scenario in WiMAX OFDMA systems. In this paper, a simple technique to switch between diversity and multiplexing has been proposed. It is discerned through simulations that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement than that can be obtained with either multiplexing or diversity alone.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.145","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678054.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO Switching for Mobile WiMAX OFDMA Systems: Performance Trade Off","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678054/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO Switching for Mobile WiMAX OFDMA Systems: Performance Trade Off","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356102","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678054/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO Switching for Mobile WiMAX OFDMA Systems: Performance Trade Off","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061505S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678055,"authors":[{"name":"Haitao Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Li","id":"37600682600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","MIMO","OFDM","Array signal processing","Interference","Base stations","Downlink","Job shop scheduling","Transmitting antennas","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibase collaborative transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO OFDM","zero forcing beamforming","cooperative downlink transmission","multicell multiantenna cellular networks","base station coordination","distributed scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678055","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem cooperative downlink transmission in multicell multiantenna cellular networks.

In this paper, an improved channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM system is proposed by exploiting a new method of pilot insert by which pilots are inserted into different carriers at different time. The method can estimate the CSI of all frequencies, so it will enhance the ability to resist frequency selective fading. Then it regards the results of interpolation as pre-estimation and takes different Averaged Channel Estimation in the Time-domain (ACE-T) on different channel conditions to get final channel estimation. The effectiveness of the new technique is demonstrated through the simulation of an OFDM system with two-transmit and two-receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678057.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Aided Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Channel state information","Frequency estimation","Fading","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Digital audio broadcasting","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","time-domain analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot aided channel estimation","pilot insert","transmit-and-receive antennas","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO OFDM systems","channel state information","frequency selective fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Aided Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678057/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356105","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Aided Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115659S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678058,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongli Wu","affiliation":["Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhongli","lastName":"Wu","id":"37878618700"},{"name":"Runhe Qiu","affiliation":["Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Runhe","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37597860400"},{"name":"Shan Zhu","affiliation":["Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37881445000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678058","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has attracted much attention as a solution of high-quality service for next generation wireless communications. However, like OFDM, one of main problems of MIMO-OFDM is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, a novel method to reduce the MIMO-OFDM PAPR is proposed. This method applies space and frequency two-dimensional subblock permutation and inversion to the multiple antenna OFDM signals based on STBC. Two suboptimal schemes, termed successive suboptimal SFPI (SS-SFPI) and random suboptimal SFPI (RS-SFPI) are presented to reduce the complexity of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that SFPI improves PAPR reduction performance compared with existing PAPR scheme, and the suboptimal schemes can significantly reduce PAPR on all transmit branches at the same time with low complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678058.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM PAPR Reduction by Space-Frequency Permutation and Inversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","MIMO","OFDM modulation","Baseband","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Block codes","Distribution functions","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM PAPR reduction","space-frequency permutation","space-frequency inversion","multiple-input multiple-output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless communication","peak-to-average power ratio","two-dimensional subblock permutation","multiple antenna signals","STBC","computational complexity","space-time block code","successive suboptimal SFPI","random suboptimal SFPI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM PAPR Reduction by Space-Frequency Permutation and Inversion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356106","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM PAPR Reduction by Space-Frequency Permutation and Inversion","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073845S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4678059,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Ming He","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Li-Ming","lastName":"He","id":"37395566800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678059","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"abstract":"The combination of Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is regarded as a promising technique for the future wireless communications. However, the performance of MIMO OFDM systems is very sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) which introduces inter-carrier-interference (ICI). Consequently, CFO estimation plays a key role in MIMO OFDM systems. In this paper, a novel scheme for CFO estimation is proposed, which is based on training sequences composed of repeated pseudo-noise (PN) sequences. In the proposed scheme, single-g estimators are adopted for CFO acquisition to get large estimation range. And, multiple-g estimators are used for CFO tracking to improve estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that all the estimators in our scheme have superior performance, and are more robust and accurate than Schenk's scheme [10] [11] both in the AWGN channel and in the multipath channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Robustness","Frequency synchronization","Transmitting antennas","Frequency domain analysis","Wireless communication","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency estimation","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset estimation","MIMO OFDM systems","multiinput multioutput","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless communications","carrier frequency offset","intercarrier-interference","training sequences","pseudo-noise sequences","single-g estimators","multiple-g estimators","AWGN channel","multipath channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345378","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053983S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4678061,"authors":[{"name":"Yilei Yao","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Yao","id":"37691901000"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37064956400"},{"name":"Shangzhi Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shangzhi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37686989300"},{"name":"Yeqing Qian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yeqing","lastName":"Qian","id":"37290127300"},{"name":"Fuqiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fuqiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289975000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678061","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"This paper presents a balanced power control scheme for the uplink of cellular MIMO system.

Simulation results show that the proposed approach, compared to the optimal water-filling algorithm, actually achieves significantly lower total power consumption with similar performance in throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balanced Power Control in Uplink MIMO-OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","MIMO","Energy consumption","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative algorithms","Receiving antennas","Interference","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balanced power control","uplink MIMO-OFDM system","cellular MIMO system","power consumption","convex optimization","adaptive power allocation","interior-point method","optimal water-filling algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Balanced Power Control in Uplink MIMO-OFDM System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356108","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balanced Power Control in Uplink MIMO-OFDM System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066097S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678062,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Shu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","Dept. of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of SCI and TECH, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Shu","id":"37296299900"},{"name":"Xinxin Feng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of SCI and TECH, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085948646"},{"name":"Qingchuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of SCI and TECH, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingchuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37854119600"},{"name":"Zhengyu Cai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of SCI and TECH, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085948778"},{"name":"Renhong Xie","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of SCI and TECH, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Renhong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085778259"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678062","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"abstract":"High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a disadvantage of comb-type frequency-domain training pattern (FDTP) in MIMO OFDM system.

(2) Resource allocation procedures for traffics' UB part and non-UB part, which aims to satisfy traffic QoS, maximize the system throughput and keep fairness among users.

The last smoothing procedure greatly decrease the estimation error introduced by channel noise and interpolation error so achieved better mean square error (MSE) performance and symbol error rate (SER) performance than the conventional interpolation method such as linear interpolation and DFT based interpolation, and the error floor is greatly decreased compared to DFT based interpolation scheme. The computational complexity increased by the smoothing procedure is only linearly proportional to the effective subcarrier-number. Simulations show the performance improvements offered by our approach to the existing ones.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.167","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Linear Regression Based Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local Linear Regression Based Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678076/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345380","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678076/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Linear Regression Based Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064781S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678079,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology, College of information Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405192100"},{"name":"Ke Zhang","affiliation":["Coll. of Inf.

This paper studies an efficient ICI cancellation method termed ICI self-cancellation scheme. The scheme works in two very simple steps. At the transmitter side, one data symbol is modulated onto a group of adjacent subcarriers with a group of weighting coefficients. The weighting coefficients are designed so that the ICI caused by the channel frequency errors can be minimized. At the receiver side, by linearly combining the received signals on these subcarriers with proposed coefficients, the residual ICI contained in the received signals can then be further reduced. The carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) can be increased by 15 and 30 dB when the group size is two or three, respectively, for a channel with a constant frequency offset. Although the redundant modulation causes a reduction in bandwidth efficiency, it can be compensated, for example, by using larger signal alphabet sizes. Simulations show that OFDM systems using the proposed ICI self-cancellation scheme perform much better than standard systems while having the same bandwidth efficiency in multipath mobile radio channels with large Doppler frequencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Cancellation Method of OFDM ICI","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.171","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self-Cancellation Method of OFDM ICI","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678080/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356124","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Cancellation Method of OFDM ICI","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100246S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678081,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Gong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji of China, UTJC, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37591661700"},{"name":"Wan-Cheng Ge","affiliation":["Chinese-German School for Postgraduate Studies, University of Tongji of China, UTJC, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Cheng","lastName":"Ge","id":"37632182500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678081","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Fading","Frequency domain analysis","Mean square error methods","Timing","Delay effects","Amplitude estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","random sequences","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","super-imposed PN sequences","OFDM structure","super-imposed pseudo-random sequences","time domain synchronization","first channel delay","periodically super-imposed sequences","channel path","minimum mean square error","periodical sequences","depth fading channels","channel estimation algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"An OFDM structure based on super-imposed pseudo-random sequences for time domain synchronization is proposed.

In most situations, its' performance suffices in an acquisition mode. But in low signal-to-noise ratio AWGN channels and multi-path fading channels, the maximum likelihood peak values are not stable in the right place due to high noise effects, multipath delays and Doppler effects respectively. Some samples of cyclic prefix have been polluted by ISI. A new improved solution based on cyclic prefix in DVB-T system is proposed in this paper, which chooses different methods according to signal-to-noise ratio and multi-path delay depth. Averaging the maximum likelihood function in several consecutive symbols, dynamic regulation correlation slide windows and enlarging observation vectors are the key optimized points. It is shown that the proposed method can get sharp peak values and improve the symbol precision compared with the existing methods both in AWGN channels and in multipath channels.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.174","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678083.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel OFDM Symbol Synchronization Algorithm Based on Cyclic Prefix in DVB-T","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678083/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel OFDM Symbol Synchronization Algorithm Based on Cyclic Prefix in DVB-T","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356127","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678083/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel OFDM Symbol Synchronization Algorithm Based on Cyclic Prefix in DVB-T","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03539S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4678084,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290866000"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"37880684000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678084","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Radio spectrum management","Bit error rate","Throughput","Transmitters","Laboratories","Fading","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity resource allocation algorithm","multiuser OFDM systems","proportional fairness optimization","power allocation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel resource allocation algorithm based on proportional fairness in multiuser OFDM systems.

Based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection theory, the ML-ACL algorithm uses an adaptive correlation length (ACL) to greatly reduce computational complexity with nearly no degradation of detection performance. Furthermore, to compensate the channel impairments, a cell search structure based on the differential demodulation in frequency domain is proposed to accomplish cell search and the integer frequency offset estimation jointly.

Simulation results show that the presented NOFDM system has both higher bandwidth efficiency and better BER performance than standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) when the derived estimation algorithm is adopted.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOFDM System Based on Circular Conjugate Symmetry Properties of DFT","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.182","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678091.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"NOFDM System Based on Circular Conjugate Symmetry Properties of DFT","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678091/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOFDM System Based on Circular Conjugate Symmetry Properties of DFT","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038214S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678093,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Xie","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37872922500"},{"name":"Shouyi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shouyi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292116100"},{"name":"Lin Qi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qi","id":"37288542200"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678093","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Ultra wideband technology","Fourier transforms","OFDM","Partial transmit sequences","System performance","Chirp","Signal analysis","Signal mapping","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","fractional Fourier transform","selected mapping","partial transmit sequences","FrFT-based MB-OFDM ultra wide band signals","UWB systems","peak to average ratio"]}],"abstract":"Multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is being considered as a promising candidate for UWB systems due to its higher spectral efficiencies and better system performance.

A received symbol shift cancellation (SSC) algorithm and an adjacent subchannel inserting zero (ASIZ) algorithm are designed for the ICI cancellation scheme, respectively. At the transmitter, original data symbols are mapped into one special symbol block by using ASIZ, and then it is transmitted as a regular OFDM system. At the receiver, Received signals are demodulated to obtain the data symbols as a regular OFDM system, and then these symbols are processed by using SSC. By doing so, the estimation of original data symbols is obtained, and meanwhile ICI is mitigated, finally. Simulation results show that the ICI contained in the received signals can be effectively reduced by using the ASIZ scheme, and the Signal-to-Interference power Ratio (SIR) of the scheme is obviously much better than that of a regular scheme. Similarly, bit error rate (BER) performance of the scheme is much better than that of others.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique with SSC and ASIZ in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.194","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678103.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique with SSC and ASIZ in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678103/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356146","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique with SSC and ASIZ in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040254S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678104,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37558798100"},{"name":"Chunlin Xiong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Chunlin","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37411516300"},{"name":"Degang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Degang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405352500"},{"name":"Jibo Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jibo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279094700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678104","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678104","abstract":"In the paper, we proposed a Chase decoding algorithm (Chase-QRD-SIC) based on QR decomposition.

In the proposed algorithm, based on the specially designed training sequences, the destination node can decouple the signal from different relay nodes by correlation and simplify the MD(Multi-Dimensional) nonlinear problem to an ID linear problem.

A correction of the threshold of modulation and coding scheme and the channel quality information as well as the method for link prediction in Chase combining is investigated.

The continuous water-filling is modified to take the maximal rate constraint on each subcarrier into account. Its continuous outputs are optimally quantized by a non-iterative algorithm. By iteratively utilizing bit loading for OFDM, a class of resource allocation methods with low complexity for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlink is proposed. Subcarrier assignments for users are initialized independently, which may cause conflicts on arbitrary subcarriers. We suggest a method for conflict cancellation, which may be improved by using appropriate sorting criteria. The proposed method is compared to a newly suggested reference method by simulation. Within the simulation the performance loss is limited by about 5% whereas the complexity reduction is up to 95%.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.212","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678121.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Resource Allocation for OFDMA Downlink Utilizing An Efficient Bit Loading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678121/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Resource Allocation for OFDMA Downlink Utilizing An Efficient Bit Loading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356163","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678121/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Resource Allocation for OFDMA Downlink Utilizing An Efficient Bit Loading","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098953S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678122,"authors":[{"name":"Eun-Jung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eun-Jung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37877504300"},{"name":"Tao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37878004300"},{"name":"Myoung-Seob Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myoung-Seob","lastName":"Lim","id":"37277106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678122","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bandwidth","Signal restoration","Bit error rate","Power engineering and energy","Detectors","Throughput","Data communication","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio","OFDM system","power amplifier","BER","clipping method"]}],"abstract":"The high peak OFDM signal out of the linear region of the power amplifier is compressed with fixed scale down ratio instead of clipping.

Finally, we show that PV based comparison in SLM and PTS techniques gives degraded PAPR performance compared to the actual PAPR based comparison.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Analysis in OFDM Signals Based on Power Variance","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.219","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678128.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Analysis in OFDM Signals Based on Power Variance","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678128/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Analysis in OFDM Signals Based on Power Variance","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036976S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678129,"authors":[{"name":"Lidong Wang","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, Anshan, China","University of Science and Technology Liaoning, Anshan, P.

Space-time codes (STC) are designed to exploit multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems and by doing so, an enormous increase in the capacity of wireless systems can be achieved. STC can be viewed as combined coding and modulation scheme for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) channels. Using an efficient way to allocate different symbols to different antennas, while adding coding redundancy, the code can achieve full antenna diversity and good coding gain. The paper presents performance comparisons of different space-time codes using a single receiver. Space-time codes employ redundancy to minimize the effects of fading, noise and interference. Although, the Alamouti code does not perform as well as the same space-time trellis code, it is most preferred choice due to its computational simplicity and satisfactory performance.

Each pilot symbol was composed of repeated short PN-sequences. By using this kind of pilot, the estimation of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) was performed into two steps, an acquisition step and a tracking step. During the acquisition step, the estimation range and precision can be adjusted. Once the parameters are properly designed, the CFO efficiently estimated was large by coarse estimation and accurate by fine estimation. Making full use of the relation between the CFO and the channel coefficient, the CFO tracking is realized based on the decision feedback algorithm. Simulation results show that this algorithm has satisfactory performance. Increasing the quantity of the pilot symbols can improve the ability of the CFO and the channel tracking but decrease the spectrum efficiency. Thereby quantity of the pilot symbols should be trade-off.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678136.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Synchronization joint Channel Estimation for OFDM Using Block-Type Pilot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Feedback","System performance","Maximum likelihood estimation","Information science","Performance analysis","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency synchronization joint channel estimation","OFDM","block-type pilot","PN-sequences","decision feedback algorithm","channel tracking","spectrum efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Synchronization joint Channel Estimation for OFDM Using Block-Type Pilot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356177","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Synchronization joint Channel Estimation for OFDM Using Block-Type Pilot","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047055S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678138,"authors":[{"name":"Shanlin Sun","firstName":"Shanlin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37694664700"},{"name":"Chunping Hou","firstName":"Chunping","lastName":"Hou","id":"37275551400"},{"name":"Lei Yan","firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yan","id":"37697378500"},{"name":"Jinlin Fu","firstName":"Jinlin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37693463400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678138","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Transmitters","Signal processing algorithms","Fading","Nonlinear distortion","Frequency domain analysis","Degradation","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","fast Fourier transforms","mobile radio","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average porer ratio","discrete cosine transform","inverse fast Fourier transforms","nonlinear distortion"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed for the first time in this paper in order to solve the distortion due to great Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of OFDM systems signals.

DTC-OFDM combines Turbo codes, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and differential detection, which has the advantages of high spectrum efficiency and suppression of multipath fading, jamming and noise.

However, it is difficult to reconstruct the information of target by antenna array in IR-UWB imaging system. Several imaging schemes, such as Capon beamforming-based method have been applied in ultra sound imaging. In this paper, the Capon beamforming-based method is proposed to apply to the IR-UWB imaging system to reconstruct a point target in free space. A circular antenna array was used for signal transceiving. According to the results, the Capon beamforming-based method is feasible for IR-UWB imaging system.

Several imaging schemes, such as delay-and-sum (DAS), Capon beamforming-based method etc., were proposed in the previous literatures. But there is few method whose aims were to reconstruct the shape of the target. In this paper, a shape reconstruction method employing IR-UWB signal was proposed. The proposed method is based on the DAS imaging algorithm. Multiple aspects of the target were illuminated in the proposed method to obtain more information about the target than what can be obtained through only one aspect in the traditional imaging systems. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was employed to simulate the received data for the 2-D imaging using the proposed method. From the image results, the shape of target can be recognized. The capability of the proposed shape reconstruction method is verified, and it can be concluded that the more aspects were illuminated, the more precise shape of the target can be obtained using the proposed shape reconstruction method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Shape Reconstruction Method Using IR-UWB by Illuminating the Target from Multiple Aspects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Reconstruction algorithms","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Ultra wideband radar","RF signals","Ground penetrating radar","Frequency","Delay","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","image recognition","image reconstruction","radar imaging","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape reconstruction method","impulse radio ultra wide band signal","imaging systems","delay-and-sum imaging algorithm","finite-difference time-domain method","shape recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Shape Reconstruction Method Using IR-UWB by Illuminating the Target from Multiple Aspects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356214","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Shape Reconstruction Method Using IR-UWB by Illuminating the Target from Multiple Aspects","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01-03-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088297S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678182,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghai Yang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China","Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288952900"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"},{"name":"Fenglin Fu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fenglin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37411388800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678182","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","AWGN","Fading","Error probability","OFDM","Computer errors","Ultra wideband technology","Log-normal distribution","Error analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","log normal distribution","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STBC MB-OFDM UWB","bit error performance","orthogonal space-time block coded MB-OFDM UWB systems","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultrawideband systems","chi-squared log-normal distribution","bit error probability","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"Bit error performance is investigated in this paper for orthogonal space-time block coded (STBC) multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) systems.

The main goal of this paper is to present and analyze base station allocation of subcarriers and adaptive modulation. We impose a set of proportional fairness constraints to assure that each user can achieve a required data rate. Since the optimal solution to the fairness problem is extremely computationally complex to obtain, we propose an adaptive radio resource allocation method based on differential evolutionary algorithm for multiuser OFDMA system. The performance of the described schemes is further evaluated in numerical experiments. We improve the convergence of the differential evolutionary algorithm through the method of elitist selection and adding some individuals with 'good' genes to the initial population.

This protocol makes cognitive users sense licensed channels periodically, and each period consists of a fixed number of slots. When cognitive users identify un-used licensed channels, they use IEEE 802.11 distribution coordination function (DCF) to contend the spare channels. According to 802.11 DCF, all other cognitive users freeze their backoff counters when a cognitive user transmits data. So the decrement of backoff counter, which equals to the decrement of the number of slots in one period, depends on the traffic of cognitive users. When the slots of one period decrease to zero, this period ends. So the duration of each period may be variable with different busy conditions of cognitive users. We use the Markov chain model to estimate the saturation throughput of our proposed MAC protocol.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.292","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678201.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.292","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Slot-Based MAC Protocol in Cognitive Radio Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Slot-Based MAC Protocol in Cognitive Radio Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678201/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678201/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356230","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Slot-Based MAC Protocol in Cognitive Radio Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121255S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4678202,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lin","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering Deptt., Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37596687400"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering Deptt., Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678202","dbTime":"83 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Detectors","Signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","AWGN","System performance","Computer vision","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio system","temporal design tradeoffs","spectrum congestion","under utilization","interference avoidance","noncooperative form","sensing frequency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Design Tradeoffs in the Sensing of Cognitive Radio System","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.293","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678202","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is proposed as an approach to solve the conflict between the spectrum congestion and under-utilization.

After each detection, the detection results are fused to give the final decision.

Simulation results are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.296","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678205.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.296","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Scheduling and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Scheduling and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678205/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678205/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356234","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Scheduling and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048237S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678208,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Research Centre of Communication, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37858891600"},{"name":"Xuezhi Tan","affiliation":["Research Centre of Communication, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuezhi","lastName":"Tan","id":"37290839800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678208","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"Based on the characteristics of cognitive radio (CR) and the transmission features of OFDM, this article offers the algorithms for the spectrum allocation in OFDM. Aiming at the probability of detection by the CR and the upper limit of the noise which can be suffered by the authorized user, CR achieves the maximal channel capability through the allocation of the sub-carriers and the power. This article provides three algorithms: the Irrigation Algorithm with the capacity optimization, the Revision Greedy Algorithm with the minimum interference to the authorized user and the Grouping Allocation Algorithm with the minimum computation load. These three algorithms emphasize particularly on different characters about CR. The simulation indicates that when the amount of the sub-channels is great, the Revision Greedy Algorithm is suited for the CR; the Grouping Allocation Algorithm has a better real-time performance, although we need choose an appropriate grouping number to balance the complexity of computation and the loss of channel capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678208.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Spectrum Allocation Algorithm of Cognitive Radio Based on OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","OFDM","Chromium","Resource management","Irrigation","Greedy algorithms","Communications technology","Radio spectrum management","Communication system control","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum allocation algorithm","cognitive radio","OFDM","transmission features","channel allocation","irrigation algorithm","capacity optimization","revision greedy algorithm","grouping allocation algorithm","channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Spectrum Allocation Algorithm of Cognitive Radio Based on OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678208/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356236","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Spectrum Allocation Algorithm of Cognitive Radio Based on OFDM","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05937S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678209,"authors":[{"name":"Cuiran Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cuiran","lastName":"Li","id":"37291261500"},{"name":"Jie Zuo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37884106900"},{"name":"Jianli Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianli","lastName":"Xie","id":"37292000700"},{"name":"Chengshu Li","affiliation":["Modern Telecommunication Institute, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengshu","lastName":"Li","id":"37291261600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678209","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Frequency","Access protocols","Throughput","Radio control","Performance analysis","Power engineering and energy","Detectors","Computer vision","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","packet radio networks","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource awareness channel","opportunistic spectrum sharing","primary users","cognitive radio users","cognitive radio system","fixed frequency random access channel","radio transmission","channel access protocols","control field","transmitter-based code assignment","data portion","success probability","data signal lengths","transmission packet","joint detection capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678209","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.300","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Cognitive radio has been considered as an efficient approach to opportunistic spectrum sharing between primary users and cognitive radio users. The most important challenge of a cognitive radio system is to identify the primary users over a wide rage of the spectrum. Considering that the existing sensing techniques would be time-consuming and wasteful of power, Holland etc. give the concept of Resource Awareness Channel (RAC) - a fixed frequency random access channel on which all radios periodically transmit information about which resources are being used by the data that are receiving. In this paper, we propose an improvement on the scheme, for the radio's transmission on the RAC, we use five different channel access protocols for the control field. Meanwhile, the transmitter-based code assignment is applied for spreading the data portion of each packet based on the idea of joint detection. The success probability for a radio trying to transmit on the RAC is analyzed and the effects on the performance for the transmission power, the period of radio's transmission on the RAC, and the ratio of data signal lengths in bits for a transmission packet are evaluated. Also, the throughput per packet length is deduced and simulated for different channel access protocols and joint detection capacity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678209.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Resource Awareness Channel for Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678209/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Resource Awareness Channel for Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356237","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Resource Awareness Channel for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046166S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678210,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Hua He","affiliation":["Institute of personal communication, MII Key lab on mobile communication CQUPT, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Li-Hua","lastName":"He","id":"37085948368"},{"name":"Xianzhong Xie","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Telecommunication System Information and Control Technology, NO.36 Institute of CETC, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Xianzhong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288936900"},{"name":"Xue-Tao Dong","affiliation":["Institute of personal communication, MII Key lab on mobile communication CQUPT, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Tao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085947762"},{"name":"Tong Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of personal communication, MII Key lab on mobile communication CQUPT, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085944224"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678210","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Fading","Degradation","Shadow mapping","Statistics","Wireless sensor networks","Probability","Helium","Mobile communication","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twice-cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio systems"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twice-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Systems","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.301","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678210","abstract":"The sensing performance of local detection in cognitive radio systems will be degraded when the channel experience fading and shadowing, and hidden terminal problem is inevitable for the primary transmitter-sensing.

But in most cases we seldom take full advantage of the spectrum. This problem can be alleviated by the cognitive radio paradigm that aims at devising spectrum sensing and management techniques, thereby allowing radios to intelligently locate and use frequencies other than those in the ISM band. In cognitive radio, channel sensing should be able to detect the signals from other systems which are using the same frequency band in order to avoid the mutual interference, which is so important that determine the cognitive radio success. In this paper, we propose a channel sensing algorithm based on ART-2 (adaptive resonance theory) neural networks which well satisfy the WMNs structure. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can give the more correct sensing results and remarkably improves the cognitive WMNs performance.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.312","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678221.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Sensing Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Wireless mesh networks","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Spine","Radio spectrum management","RF signals","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","neural nets","radio networks","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel sensing algorithm","neural networks","cognitive wireless mesh networks","cognitive radio paradigm","spectrum sensing","management techniques","channel sensing","signal detection","interference avoidance","adaptive resonance theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel Sensing Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356246","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Sensing Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048298S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4678222,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Han","affiliation":["INHA-WiTLaboratory, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Han","id":"37619358400"},{"name":"Guanbo Zheng","affiliation":["INHA-WiTLaboratory, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Guanbo","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37878961200"},{"name":"Sung Hwan Sohn","affiliation":["INHA-WiTLaboratory, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Hwan","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37285929900"},{"name":"Jae Moung Kim","affiliation":["INHA-WiTLaboratory, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Moung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293480200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678222","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Signal detection","Radiofrequency identification","Wireless communication","Radiofrequency interference","Detectors","Signal processing","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","blind source separation","channel spacing","cognitive radio","correlation methods","OFDM modulation","probability","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic autocorrelation","blind OFDM detection","blind OFDM identification","cognitive radio","spectral resource utilization","spectrum sensing method","two-step signal detection","signal separation","subcarrier spacing","guard interval","peak searching method","AWGN","false alarm probability"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is considered as a promising technique to increase the utilization of limited spectral resource.

The key parameters to separate different OFDM signals are the subcarrier spacing and guard interval. A simple but reliable peak detection method is adopted in the first step, while a peak searching method is used to determine the length of guard interval.

A target SINR game (TSG) is a powerful tool to regulate each secondary user's behavior, provide them with decent SINRs (i.e. close to their target SINRs) and simultaneously limit the interference they cause to primary users and other secondary users.

Experimental results show that when the traffic demands of CR users are limited and change with time, our algorithm can dramatically improve the fairness and produce high efficiency of the spectrum allocation.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.317","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678226.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.317","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-Demand Dynamic Spectrum Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-Demand Dynamic Spectrum Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678226/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678226/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356250","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-Demand Dynamic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072364S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678229,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxue Liu","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology for Opto-electronic Information, Yantai University, Yantai, Shandong, China","School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yunxue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675738800"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37270835500"},{"name":"Yanbo Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yanbo","lastName":"Ma","id":"37671222400"},{"name":"Jiali Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675425900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678229","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Relays","Numerical models","Performance analysis","Information science","Performance gain","Radio transmitters","Protocols","Analytical models","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive networks","cognitive user","power constraint","numerical model","transmission power","channel gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678229","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.320","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"In cognitive networks, cooperative spectrum sensing is employed to detect the presence of primary user quickly.

On the other hand, on some hot spot business frequency bands, spectrum resources become in short supply. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology based on cognitive radio is an effective measure to improve the spectrum utility efficiency. It can increase spectrum income for spectrum holder, and provide a variety of services to users. Many papers discussed the technology of dynamic spectrum access and sharing based on cognitive radio. However, few reaches to the field of system performances evaluation based on spectrum pool strategy. In this paper, we propose two DSA strategies: one based on instant access manner, and the other based on spectrum pool access manner. Both theoretical and simulation results indicate that the DSA strategy based on spectrum pool has obvious advantages. Optimal capacity and update time of spectrum pool are all studied. It is found that there is quantitative mathematical relationship between the optimal capacity of spectrum pool and system efficiency. Update time of spectrum pool varies according to spectrum characteristics and user's quality of service (QoS) demands. There are different update strategies in licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. Under the assumed conditions, the update interval varies within one hour in most cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678233/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10356256","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678233/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Strategy of Dynamic Spectrum Access Based-on Spectrum Pool","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategy of Dynamic Spectrum Access Based-on Spectrum Pool","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051868S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678234,"authors":[{"name":"Shibing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Shibing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37557083500"},{"name":"Zhihua Bao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Bao","id":"37400398100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678234","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Ultra wideband technology","Signal processing","Chromium","Narrowband","Wireless sensor networks","Jamming","Interference suppression","Wireless LAN","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","interleaved codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","ultra-wideband system","narrowband wireless systems","radio environment","UWB system","sensing technology","interleaving-coding technology","spectrum sensing","undetected interference","signal-to-interference ratio","wireless communication","anti-interference strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.325","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678234.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategy of Anti-Interference Based on Cognitive Radio in Ultra-Wideband System","abstract":"It is a challenging problem in the ultra-wideband (UWB) system to be interfered by narrowband wireless systems or to interfere narrowband wireless systems.

This paper addresses the strategy of anti-interference in UWB system based on interaction with the environment in which it operates. There are two operations to avoid the interference, sensing technology and interleaving-coding technology. The model of the UWB system is described and the steps of spectrum sensing are analyzed.

The BER performance can approach that of the maximum likelihood decoding algorithm quickly by increasing the value of one parameter of MTCM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Bit error rate","Signal processing algorithms","Channel coding","Wireless communication","MIMO","Euclidean distance","Performance analysis","Wireless networks","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","maximum likelihood decoding","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-trellis-coded-modulation","channel coding","communication systems","decoding complexity","maximum likelihood decoding algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.350","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678259.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Special Property of Multiple-Trellis-Coded-Modulation Utilized for its Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Special Property of Multiple-Trellis-Coded-Modulation Utilized for its Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678259/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678259/","accessionNumber":"10356280","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Special Property of Multiple-Trellis-Coded-Modulation Utilized for its Decoding","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040588S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678260,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Miao Song","affiliation":["School Of Electric And Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Miao","lastName":"Song","id":"37533367200"},{"name":"Lei Huang","affiliation":["School Of Electric And Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37879984700"},{"name":"Cheng-Qun Yin","affiliation":["School Of Electric And Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Qun","lastName":"Yin","id":"37068649000"},{"name":"Gui-Yun Wang","affiliation":["School Of Electric And Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Gui-Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37878801400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678260","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"abstract":"Power line communication for home networking is a new convenient method.

But it is difficult for LDPC codes to be commercial because of their high encoding complexity and consequent encoding delay. Using an efficient encoding method proposed by Richardson and Urbanke, we can efficiently reduce the LDPC encoding complexity apparently to the linear complexity, but the encoding delay becomes much longer because of the forward substitution operation which can only be performed serially. In this paper, we consider the LDPC encoding method combined with the construction of H matrix to construct the LDPC codes with linear encoding complexity, which we named as LEC-LDPC (linear encoding complexity LDPC) codes.

The new scheme is divided into two major steps which are BCH processing and turbo processing. Firstly, information bits are transmitted using TCM and then the incremental parity bits based on BCH codes are transmitted upon the reception of NAK. Secondly, the incremental redundancy (IR) based on rate compatible punctured turbo (RCPT) codes is transmitted using BPSK if the decoding of BCH codes is failed. Averaged diversity combining (ADC) technology is used through all the (re)transmissions of the same packet. Performance is evaluated via computer simulation and the results are compared with the popular RCPT scheme. Simulation show that our scheme has higher throughput in medium to high SNR regions and the gains are considerable. Moreover, the average computational complexity of our scheme is lower than the pure RCPT scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid ARQ Scheme Based on TCM and Concatenated Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Concatenated codes","Throughput","Diversity reception","Decoding","Redundancy","Block codes","Protocols","Forward error correction","Turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","computational complexity","concatenated codes","diversity reception","phase shift keying","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid ARQ scheme","TCM codes","concatenated codes","turbo processing","BCH codes","incremental redundancy","rate compatible punctured turbo codes","BPSK","averaged diversity combining technology","computer simulation","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid ARQ Scheme Based on TCM and Concatenated Codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356296","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid ARQ Scheme Based on TCM and Concatenated Codes","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072395S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678277,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Research, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675427100"},{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Research, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675427000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678277","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Channel coding","WiMAX","Throughput","Decoding","Turbo codes","Hardware","Code standards","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","automatic repeat request","channel coding","data communication","parity check codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IMT-advanced system","low density parity check codes","structured LDPC codes","channel coding","data transmission rate","inherent encoder/decoder parallel feature","Wimax LDPC","3GPP2 LDPC","ZTE","flexible code rate","code size","IR-HARQ","matrix generation","rate matching","bit priority mapping"]}],"abstract":"Channel coding for IMT-ADVANCED system needs to support higher data throughput and transmission rate.

The co-channel interference (CCI) and noise are two major impairments to a multi-user MIMO downlink. The precoding based on signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) makes a balance between eliminating the CCI and the noise, so it improves the system performance. But the channel state of every user is different, the channel quality effects the performance of the system. This paper designs a dynamic power allocation can get a better performance. Simulation results prove the theory at last. We also illustrate that the system performance will degrade when the transmitter knows the imperfect channel state information.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678282.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Power Allocation Based on SLNR Precoding for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Radiofrequency interference","Mobile antennas","System performance","Power system modeling","Channel state information","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile computing","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","MIMO communication","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power allocation","SLNR precoding","multi-user MIMO downlink","cochannel interference","signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power Allocation Based on SLNR Precoding for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678282/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345407","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Power Allocation Based on SLNR Precoding for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046739S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4678286,"authors":[{"name":"Xingyu Xiang","affiliation":["National Communication Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37868327100"},{"name":"Wen Zhong","affiliation":["National Communication Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37405602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678286","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Detectors","Matrix decomposition","Maximum likelihood detection","Viterbi algorithm","Noise cancellation","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","data communication","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","trellis codes","Viterbi detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viterbi-like detection","low complexity detection","sorted QR decomposition","V-BLAST system","vertical Bell labs layered space-time","multiple antenna system","maximum-likelihood trellis","MMSE-OSIC"]}],"abstract":"Vertical Bell labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) is designed to exploit the capacity advantage of multiple antenna system in rich-scattering environments.

When the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique is integrated, better performance and system capacity can be achieved. But the computational complexity of classical detection algorithm based on exhaustive searching, such as maximum-likelihood (ML) rule, is too high and inconvenient to realisation. Although sphere-decoding (SD) algorithm is able to greatly decrease the detection complexity due to the sphere-constrained searching, the decoding complexity is very high especially when the constellation has a lot of points and the number of antennas is large. A modified detection algorithm based on SD method is proposed in this paper, for the sake of further decreasing the complexity. It decodes according to the signal-noise-ratio (SNR). The detector outputs the zero-forcing (ZF) detection results when the SNR is relatively high, otherwise it subtracts these decoded signals from the original receiving signals and then decodes them by SD algorithm. The simulation results shows that the performance of such modified algorithm has little difference as compared with that of SD algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.379","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678288.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Sphere-Decoding Based Detector for MIMO LS-CDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678288/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Sphere-Decoding Based Detector for MIMO LS-CDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356306","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678288/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Sphere-Decoding Based Detector for MIMO LS-CDMA System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044637S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678289,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang-Yang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Huafan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hoang-Yang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274986700"},{"name":"Yung-Ping Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Ping","lastName":"Tu","id":"37399843800"},{"name":"Wen-Hsien Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsien","lastName":"Fang","id":"37274389700"},{"name":"Kyar-Chan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kyar-Chan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37876967900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678289","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Multiple access interference","Interference cancellation","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Computational complexity","Concurrent computing","Channel bank filters","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","filtering theory","mean square error methods","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity iterative groupwise soft multiuser detection","multirate MC-CDMA","multicarrier code division multiple access system uplink","iterative groupwise receiver","channel correlations","minimum mean squared error filter"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses a low complexity multi-rate multiuser detector (MUD) for the uplink multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems. The new MUD is an iterative groupwise receiver with the assistance of soft information to refine the interference estimates to enhance the interference cancellation capability. The users are first classified into different groups according to their transmission rates. In each iteration, these groups of users are detected sequentially based on a set of group detectors with the removal of multiple access interferences (MAI) group by group, where the soft information is utilized to render more precise interference estimates for more effective cancellation of interferences. To alleviate the computational overhead, the users in each group are further partitioned into appropriate subgroups based on their effective channel correlations and then detected in parallel by a bank of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) filters. Simulations show that the proposed MUD, with drastically reduced computations, can render satisfactory performance compared with previous works .","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Iterative Groupwise Soft Multiuser Detection for Multirate MC-CDMA","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.380","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678289.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Iterative Groupwise Soft Multiuser Detection for Multirate MC-CDMA","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678289/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356307","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Iterative Groupwise Soft Multiuser Detection for Multirate MC-CDMA","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060664S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678293,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Meng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37287259200"},{"name":"Limin Meng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Meng","id":"37417022700"},{"name":"Hong Peng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Peng","id":"37273793000"},{"name":"Jingyu Hua","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Hua","id":"37266791700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678293","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Base stations","Interference suppression","Performance gain","Multiuser detection","Fading","Decorrelation","Educational institutions","Knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","adaptive signal detection","cellular radio","code division multiple access","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group-blind MMSE multiuser detector","MC-CDMA uplink environment","multicarrier code division multiple access","base station receiver","spreading sequences","semiblind adaptive MMSE detector","eigenvalues estimation errors","subspace tracking","adaptive subspace estimation","intracell interference suppression","intercell interference suppression"]}],"abstract":"In the multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) uplink, the base station receiver has the knowledge of the spreading sequences of all the users within the cell, but not that of the users from other cells.

We develop an modified MMSE detector which can combat the performance deterioration induced by eigenvalues estimation errors. Moreover, the proposed method exploits the orthogonal projection approximation subspace tracking (OPAST) algorithm for adaptive subspace estimation. This proposed detector makes use of the spreading sequences of all known users to suppress the intracell interference, while suppresses the intercell interference using the modified MMSE detector.

It is worth noting that multicode operation can provide additional degrees of freedom in the code domain to achieve high data rates. Furthermore, we propose in this paper a parallel arbitrated successive interference cancellation (PASIC) scheme, which utilize a certain number of conventional SIC detectors with different ordering sequences in parallel and then combines the soft output of each individual SIC to achieve performance gains. Simulation results show the proposed approach can achieve a bit error rate (BER) performance that is very close to the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. However, the complexity of this approach is linear with the number of SIC components.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678294.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multicode STBC-MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Silicon carbide","OFDM","Bit error rate","MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Detectors","Performance gain","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","diversity reception","error statistics","interference suppression","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive interference cancellation detection","multicode space-time block code-MIMO systems","multiple-input- multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM","multicode spread spectrum techniques","diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff","parallel arbitrated successive interference cancellation","conventional SIC detectors","bit error rate","maximum-likelihood decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multicode STBC-MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356312","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive Interference Cancellation Detection for Multicode STBC-MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046901S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678295,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Bei","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Bei","id":"37866544700"},{"name":"Qi Zhu","firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678295","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Matrix decomposition","Signal detection","MIMO","Diversity reception","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Laboratories","OFDM","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematics computing","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","low complex V-BLAST detection","ML-DFE algorithm","ZF-DFE algorithm","maximum likelihood algorithm","OSIC-ML","simple matrix operations","QR decomposition","Matlab simulation"]}],"abstract":"ML-DFE algorithm is known as the combination of the ZF-DFE algorithm and ML algorithm.

Based on weak turbulence channel model, the slot error rate and packet error rate are derived, and compared with OOK, PPM and DPIM. Simulations show that error rate of MDPIM is inferior to PPM and DPIM, but obviously superior to OOK. Moreover, MDPIM, which needn' t symbol synchronization and has fixed symbol length, can simplify the receiver and solve modulator waiting or buffer overflow in comparison with PPM and DPIM respectively. Hence, MDPIM is superior in wireless optical communications system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678317.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Modified Digital Pulse Interval Modulation for Optical Wireless Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Optical modulation","Optical pulses","Digital modulation","Wireless communication","Error analysis","Optical receivers","Optical buffering","Bandwidth","Buffer overflow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","pulse modulation","pulse position modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital pulse interval modulation for optical wireless communications","modified digital pulse interval modulation","pulse position modulation","symbol synchronization and digital pulse intervai modufation","OOK","PPM","DPIM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Modified Digital Pulse Interval Modulation for Optical Wireless Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356331","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Modified Digital Pulse Interval Modulation for Optical Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.198092S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678318,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyun Teng","firstName":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Teng","id":"37086116766"},{"name":"Pengwu Tian","firstName":"Pengwu","lastName":"Tian","id":"37682204000"},{"name":"Hongyi Yu","firstName":"Hongyi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085949357"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678318","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Frequency","Feature extraction","Signal processing","Digital modulation","Pulse modulation","Signal processing algorithms","Pattern recognition","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","feature extraction","modulation","pattern classification","signal processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation classification","spectral correlation","SVM","automatic modulation recognition","digital signals","support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of automatic modulation recognition of digital signals.

It is a challenge of the high utilization rate for modern communication systems. In order to eliminate the impact of CP of OFDM, non-orthogonal multiple-modulation (NOMM) is introduced for MIMO system. Relevant error probability and bandwidth efficiency are meliorated because of the breakthrough constraints of orthogonal. A novel constellation design is proposed for NOMM, which enhances the performance resisting interference and obtain the capacity gain. NOMM offers a more effective method in practice and indicates a broad development for modulation techniques in theory as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Performance Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multi-Modulation MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.413","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678322.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Performance Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multi-Modulation MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678322/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356336","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Performance Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multi-Modulation MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081903S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678323,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In overloaded MIMO systems, since the number of near equal-power co-channel interferers is higher than the number of receive antennas, the interference cannot be completely removed by spatial filtering. In this paper, we propose a new GA based detection approach for overloaded MIMO systems, whereby proportional scaling and Gaussian mutation is employed with a hybrid function to achieve a better performance than rank scaling and uniform mutation in the previous work. Simulation results show that our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms the zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) approaches and has much lower error floor, but also provides a performance which is close to the MLD with huge symbolic and numerical complexities reduction.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.419","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678328.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Signal Detection Approach using Genetic Algorithm for Overloaded MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678328/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Signal Detection Approach using Genetic Algorithm for Overloaded MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678328/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Signal Detection Approach using Genetic Algorithm for Overloaded MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061291S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678330,"authors":[{"name":"Licheng Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37657001900"},{"name":"Xianhua Dai","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianhua","lastName":"Dai","id":"37279595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678330","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","OFDM","Interference","Frequency diversity","Frequency shift keying","Appropriate technology","Signal design","Transmitters","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","computational complexity","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier direct sequence code division multiple access","MC-DS-CDMA systems","joint carrier frequency offset","channel estimation","inter-user interference","signal matrix","low computation complexity"]}],"abstract":"A new algorithm based on pilots for the joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation of the uplink of MC-DS-CDMA systems is presented.

To resolve this problem, an improved QR-decomposition-based least squares lattice (QRD-LSL) interpolator based on cycle-counteract (CYC) nonlinear processing is proposed. Applying the discrepancy of cycle correlation characteristics between DS signal and the ambience noise, the improved interpolators can efficiently remove the DS component from the input signal of NBI suppressor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results indicate that the improved interpolator can suppress NBI in DS/CDMA effectively.

In case of queue stability is the goal, it can be shown that allocating resources to maximize a queue-length-weighted sum of the rates which are feasible in the current time slot is a stabilizing policy. However, the high complexity of user selection or the feasible rates determination for optimal scheme may prevent the real-time scheduling operation. Two simplified algorithms were provided taking the channel state, queue state and orthogonality into to account.

Simulation results reveal that the RNNP based on RKF algorithm has large improvement on the interference suppression capability compared with conventional LMS, ACM and RTRL-based canceller in CWI and ARI environments, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.433","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678342.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband Interference Suppression Using RKF-Based Recurrent Neural Network in Spread Spectrum System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband Interference Suppression Using RKF-Based Recurrent Neural Network in Spread Spectrum System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10356353","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678342/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband Interference Suppression Using RKF-Based Recurrent Neural Network in Spread Spectrum System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048151S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4678343,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Qu","firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Qu","id":"37087556242"},{"name":"Minglu Jin","firstName":"Minglu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37292061200"},{"name":"Qian Liu","firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37693641100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678343","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Array signal processing","Random processes","Adaptive arrays","Adaptive filters","Electromagnetic scattering","Finite impulse response filter","Cost function","Convergence","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna theory","array signal processing","least mean squares methods","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary LMS beamforming algorithm","least mean square algorithm","array antenna beamforming","recursive algorithm","steady state mean square error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678343","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.434","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"The conventional adaptive least mean square (LMS) algorithm has been utilized in array antenna beamforming to direct the radiated power towards the desired signal and null the multipath signals.

With equalization using non-sufficient delay and Doppler shift estimation, OFDM system will be faced with serious inter-carrier interference (ICI). To obtain more accurate channel estimation values, we discussed the time-varying characteristic of delay and Doppler shift, and proposed a delay and Doppler shift joint tracking method based on extended Kalman filter. The simulation results show that the proposed method can track the channel parameters accurately, with fast convergence speed. Monte-Carlo simulations were also carried out to evaluate the BER performances of OFDM systems with our proposed tracking method in the typical two-ray aeronautical channel, and zero-force equalization was adopted to cancel ICI. The simulation results justified effectiveness of the joint tracking method.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.435","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678344.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay and Doppler Shift Joint Tracking Method for OFDM Based Aeronautical Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678344/","displayDocTitle":"Delay and Doppler Shift Joint Tracking Method for OFDM Based Aeronautical Communication Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678344/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and Doppler Shift Joint Tracking Method for OFDM Based Aeronautical Communication Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040568S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4678352,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixiang Jiang","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37656200600"},{"name":"Meng Zhang","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406626600"},{"name":"Zichuang Li","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zichuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37655454300"},{"name":"Shengli Lu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Lu","id":"37422698800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678352","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Decision feedback equalizers","Convergence","IIR filters","Field-flow fractionation","Blind equalizers","Cost function","Application specific integrated circuits","Systems engineering and theory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed MCMA algorithm","QAM system","quadrature amplitude modulation signals","constant modulus algorithm","decision-direct least-mean-square","SGD-CMA equalizer","decision feedback equalization","stop-and-go-DD-LMS CMA"]}],"abstract":"A newly modified CMA algorithm: Stop-and-Go-DD- LMS CMA (SGD-CMA) for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals is presented.

In order to effectively suppress multiple access interference (MAI), multiple parallel code-matched filters and a decorrelating multiuser detector are used to detect each path of desired signal for each mobile user. In the output of the detector, a cumulant-based 2-D Virtual ESPRIT Algorithm (VESPA) is employed to estimate each resolvable path direction-azimuth/elevation. In the method, 2-D DOA of each sub-path signal is accurately estimated with higher resolution than the previous methods because array aperture is extended by the use of higher order cumulants.

Simulation result shows this scheme can mitigate the interference of 75%.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.494","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678403.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for Improving Sensitivity of GPS Receiver Based on Cross-Correlation Mitigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for Improving Sensitivity of GPS Receiver Based on Cross-Correlation Mitigation","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678403/","accessionNumber":"10356410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678403/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for Improving Sensitivity of GPS Receiver Based on Cross-Correlation Mitigation","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03249S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4678405,"authors":[{"name":"Jiantao Yang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiantao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37656444600"},{"name":"Jun Gao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37598668700"},{"name":"Bingkai Huang","affiliation":["Broadcasting Station, Bureau of Broadcast Television, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bingkai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37872865500"},{"name":"Xudong Wang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37881428200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678405","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Predistortion","High power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Delay","Nonlinear distortion","Educational institutions","Bandwidth","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power amplifier","shortwave communications systems","digital RF predistortion scheme","multichannel broadband digital predistortion","actuator all-digitalization","nonlinear distortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678405","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678405.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New RF Predistortion Scheme for High-Power Amplifier in Shortwave Communications Systems","abstract":"This paper proposes a new digital RF predistortion scheme for high-power amplifiers (HPAs), which can completely meet the requirements of precision and bandwidth (BW) in modern shortwave communications systems and does not use nonlinear active RF devices.

Firstly, based on wavelet decomposition theory, an image source can be decomposed into different weight levels. Then, the bit streams with different weight are modulated by FH-OFDM system, which can give low frequency bits more protection with help of hop frequency graphic design in FH-OFDM. A joint system combined with source coding and adaptive modulation method is introduced to give the image bit streams with different subcarriers, which eliminate ISI in low frequency streams more effectively. Therefore, a better reconstruction image can be obtained at receiver. Simulation results indicate that the scheme with joint source coding and adaptive modulation method can outperform the system without adaptive modulation in image quality. Under the same conditions, the proposed FH-OFDM system has better BER performance than traditional OFDM and better image quality than pseudorandom pattern FH-OFDM in the process of wireless image transmission.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.501","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678410.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Wireless Image Transmission Method Based Wavelet Decomposition Algorithm Over FH-OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678410/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Wireless Image Transmission Method Based Wavelet Decomposition Algorithm Over FH-OFDM System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356417","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678410/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Wireless Image Transmission Method Based Wavelet Decomposition Algorithm Over FH-OFDM System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043377S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678411,"authors":[{"name":"Gangcan Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Gangcan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37087270670"},{"name":"Jianping An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, P.R.

By rearranging the symbols within one received data vector, we expand the data vector with one column to a row-linearly- uncorrelated data matrix with two columns. Compared with the conventional subspace blind channel estimation, the method therefore can save half amount of the signals needed. This feature makes the proposed method be applicable for the cases where there exists limitation on the amount of the received data. Moreover, the advantage, which the complex scalar ambiguity existing in blind estimation could be reduced to the sign ambiguity, is inherited also. The whole process is dealt without the training sequences or redundant symbols interpolated.

The channel estimation algorithm herein designed introduces linear interpolation to compensate the original value offered by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for iterative step. With the utilization of the coherence among both subcarriers and symbols, the performance is improved substantially. We conduct particular simulations with comparing the bit-error-rate (BER) obtained from traditional EM algorithm and our algorithm for QPSK/16QAM. Moreover, the convergence behavior of the two algorithms is also investigated through the simulations under frequency-selective multipath conditions.

When executing 1024 bit RSA operations, the throughput is about 107.5 kbps at 200 MHz clock. When executing 2048 bit RSA operations, the throughput is about 57 kbps at 200 Mhz. It's maximum power consumption is 32.5 mW when executing 2048 bit RSA modular exponentiation.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.548","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Ultra Low Power RSA Coprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678456/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Ultra Low Power RSA Coprocessor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356457","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678456/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Ultra Low Power RSA Coprocessor","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"02-04-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072384S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4678457,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Yuan Bu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Yuan","lastName":"Bu","id":"37298628900"},{"name":"Guo-Ying Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37876866700"},{"name":"Ce-Lun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ce-Lun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600007200"},{"name":"Rong-Hua Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong-Hua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37588653500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678457","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Turbo codes","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Jamming","AWGN","Paper technology","Costs","Additive white noise","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","frequency hop communication","maximum likelihood decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","spread spectrum communication","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based turbo decoder","frequency hopping spread spectrum","FH-SS system","max-log-MAP algorithm","single-RSC structure","partial band jamming","Reed-Solomon code"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on implementing an efficient and simplified turbo decoder with FPGA.

Firstly, the concept of normalized area throughput is introduced.

Compared with the metric of expected forward progress (EFP), the proposed approach focuses on maximizing the total network throughput rather than the throughput of each node. It is shown that by using the metric of normalized area throughput, we can get that the optimum probability of sending a packet is 0.555, which is bigger than the result of 0.271 based on EFP, and the optimum transmission range is shorter than the value based on EFP metric. The optimal throughput performance of the total network is improved by approximate 56.8%, through the result of each node is degraded by about 23.5%.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.585","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678493.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to Transmission Range Optimum for Rayleigh Fading CDMA Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678493/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Transmission Range Optimum for Rayleigh Fading CDMA Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356493","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678493/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Transmission Range Optimum for Rayleigh Fading CDMA Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059353S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678498,"authors":[{"name":"Chan T.

The problem is to maximize the overall end-to-end rate with balancing the fairness among users, and find a new method as a substitute for Lee's resource allocation algorithm with high computational complexity. The proposed algorithm consists of two subproblems, where the mesh router (MR) allocates groups of subcarriers to the mesh clients (MCs) based on Nash bargaining solution according to the limited information, and each MC allocates subcarriers to each of its outgoing links based on the equal power allocation according to the full information of channel gains. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm have a comparable overall end-to-end rate with the maximal rate algorithm. Moreover, compared to Lee's resource allocation algorithm, the proposed algorithm not only needs lower computational complexity, but also provides comparable fair opportunities for the respective users (MCs), and a comparable end-to-end rate of each user.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.670","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Resource Allocation Algorithm in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on Resource Allocation Algorithm in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356558","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Resource Allocation Algorithm in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036427S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4678588,"authors":[{"name":"Hanning Chen","affiliation":["Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China","School of Graduate, CAS, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hanning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407262900"},{"name":"Yunlong Zhu","affiliation":["Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37292652200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678588","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Evolutionary computation","Particle swarm optimization","Telecommunication network reliability","Power generation economics","Interference","Mathematical model","Power system planning","Genetic algorithms","Strategic planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID networks planning","evolutionary algorithms","swarm intelligence","reader locations","mathematical model","optimization techniques","genetic algorithm","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678588","abstract":"In order to obtain accurate and reliable network planning in the RFID communications system, the locations of readers and the associated values for each of the reader parameters have to be determined.

In this paper, we develop an mathematical model for planning RFID networks based on the application of two powerful optimization techniques known as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Swarm Intelligence (SI). We present a comparative study for two EAs, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES), and one SI algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), on the RFID networks planning (RNP) problem. All the algorithms are evaluated against a test scenario (a 30 m times 30 m working space with 10 readers and 100 tags), which is subdivided into areas with different requirements. The simulation results show that the PSO algorithm obtains the superior solution for RNP problem than the other two EAs in terms of optimization accuracy and computation robustness.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.680","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678588.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFID Networks Planning Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"RFID Networks Planning Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10356568","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4678588/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFID Networks Planning Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03692S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4678662,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Sun","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37877950300"},{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"},{"name":"Sheng Meng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Meng","id":"37874503000"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678662","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system relaying","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless application protocol","Signal processing","Sun","Mobile communication","Channel state information","Wireless networks","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation algorithm","amplify-and-forward relay networks","achievable maximum signal-to-noise ratio","perfect channel state information","direct transmission","relay cooperative scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678662","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678662.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation Algorithm in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","abstract":"In this paper, the problem of power allocation in the amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative network is investigated based on the achievable maximum signal-to-noise ratio at the destination node.

A whole cooperative transmit frame of the original cooperative system consists of three sub-frames. According to different feedback schedules in a transmit frame at the destination, two basic ARQ protocols, namely post-cooperating and pre-cooperating, are proposed and analyzed. We show that both proposed ARQ protocols can improve the throughput in two-user cooperative system. Pre-cooperating protocol yields 50% gains in users' throughput than post-cooperating protocol if both users have high user-destination average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination. Nevertheless, if both of user-destination average received SNRs are low, post-cooperating protocol is more effective than pre-cooperating protocol. Proposed protocols provide useful basic tools for designing more complicated ARQ protocols. Finally, simulation results verify our analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Cooperative systems","Throughput","Relays","Feedback","Transmitting antennas","Mobile antennas","Cyclic redundancy check","Wireless application protocol","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","diversity reception","multi-access systems","protocols","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-cooperating ARQ protocol","two-user cooperative diversity system","automatic repeat request","Alamouti space-time coding","feedback schedule","pre-cooperating ARQ protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.759","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678667.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARQ Protocols for Two-User Cooperative Diversity Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ARQ Protocols for Two-User Cooperative Diversity Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678667/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678667/","accessionNumber":"10356635","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARQ Protocols for Two-User Cooperative Diversity Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08098S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4678676,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaosong Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xiaosong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37635771800"},{"name":"Guiran Chang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Guiran","lastName":"Chang","id":"37534976300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678676","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Streaming media","Forward error correction","Wireless communication","Protocols","Channel coding","Multimedia computing","Computational modeling","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","media streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peeling decoder scheme","channel coding","binary erasure channel","multimedia streams","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"For the channel coding over binary erasure channel (BEC), peeling decoder (PD) is one of the most powerful and efficient decoder, especially suitable for the transmission of multimedia streams.

Node localization has been a topic of active research in recent years. Accurate self-localization capability is highly desirable in wireless sensor network (WSN). This paper proposes a genetic simulated annealing algorithm based localization (GSAAL) algorithm for WSN. The proposed algorithm adopts two new genetic operators: single-vertex- neighborhood mutation and the descend-based arithmetic crossover. Four example problems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve higher accurate position estimation than semi-definite programming with gradient search localization (SDPL).","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.850","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678758.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network Based on Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Genetics","Simulated annealing","Global Positioning System","Patient monitoring","Temperature sensors","Fires","Event detection","Computational modeling","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","gradient methods","simulated annealing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localization algorithm","wireless sensor network","genetic simulated annealing algorithm","sensor nodes","genetic operators","single-vertex-neighborhood mutation","descend-based arithmetic crossover","semidefinite programming","gradient search localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network Based on Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356719","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network Based on Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"04-01-036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083038S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4678888,"authors":[{"name":"Dazhi Piao","affiliation":["Information Engineering College, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dazhi","lastName":"Piao","id":"37566963400"},{"name":"Guizhen Lu","affiliation":["Information Engineering College, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guizhen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37533207600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678888","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"abstract":"A 2-hop cooperative MIMO architecture is presented in the shallow water acoustic sensor network. The general Shannon capacity expression for MIMO communication is modified for this cooperative MIMO environment. The potential of the cooperative MIMO in improving the network performance is studied in terms of the average capacity per node. Conclusions can be drawn that through the cooperative MIMO organization, capacity gains obtained in the multipath rich shallow water acoustic sensor network can be several times of that in the free space environment with the same transmit power constrains. The optimum number of relay nodes for maximum capacity per node mainly depends on the input SNR, the number of sensor nodes, the number of sink element as well as the richness of multipath in the channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Cooperative MIMO in the Ad Hoc Shallow Water Acoustic Sensor Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Acoustic sensors","Underwater acoustics","Wireless sensor networks","Relays","Radio frequency","Capacitive sensors","Wireless application protocol","Robustness","Acoustical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel capacity","MIMO communication","underwater acoustic communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative MIMO architecture","shallow water acoustic sensor network","ad hoc network","Shannon capacity expression","multipath channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Cooperative MIMO in the Ad Hoc Shallow Water Acoustic Sensor Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678888/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356833","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Cooperative MIMO in the Ad Hoc Shallow Water Acoustic Sensor Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"04-01-166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109613S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4678956,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lv","affiliation":["Department of information engineering, The Academy of Armed Forces Engineering FengTai, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37288957600"},{"name":"Qinghai Wang","affiliation":["Department of information engineering, The Academy of Armed Forces Engineering FengTai, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37833650400"},{"name":"Tong Li","affiliation":["Department of information engineering, The Academy of Armed Forces Engineering FengTai, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293056300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4678956","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Data engineering","Electronic mail","Wavelet transforms","Detection algorithms","Fault detection","Monitoring","Testing","Engineering management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","computer network management","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","time series","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","self-similar network traffic data","network management","finite order Euler-Cauchy system","autoregressive moving average","time serial analysis theory","wavelet generalized likelihood ratio algorithm","wavelet transform method"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection of self-similar network traffic data is a difficult problem in network management. Due to network traffic may have the property of long term dependent, it can be approximated with a finite order Euler-Cauchy system based on ARMA (autoregressive moving average). As a result, AR (auto-regressive) model based on time serial analysis theory was used to deal with the problem of self-similar network traffic. On this basis, a wavelet generalized likelihood ratio (WGLR) algorithm was developed for anomaly diagnosis of network traffic with self-similar characteristics. WGLR algorithm combines generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm and wavelet transform method, and captures the failure point in real time. That will improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.

Though traffic matrix estimation is extensively studied, traffic matrix is generally unavailable in the large-scale IP network and is difficult to be estimated accurately. This paper proposes a novel method of large-scale IP traffic matrix estimation, termed the radial basis function (RBF) neural network and iterative proportional fitting procedure (RBFIPFP) method. Firstly, we model the large-scale IP traffic matrix estimation using the RBF neural network that has been studied widely. By training the RBF neural network, we can build the model of large-scale IP traffic matrix estimation. Secondly, combined with this model and iterative proportional fitting procedure, the good estimations of the large-scale IP traffic matrix are attained. Finally, we use the real data from the Abilene network to validate RBFIPFP. The results show that RBFIPFP can perform the accurate estimation of large-scale IP traffic matrix, and track well its dynamics.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1068","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678976.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to Large-Scale IP Traffic Matrix Estimation Based on RBF Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678976/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Large-Scale IP Traffic Matrix Estimation Based on RBF Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678976/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10356915","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Large-Scale IP Traffic Matrix Estimation Based on RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"04-02-083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061911S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4678996,"authors":[{"name":"Ihn-Han Bae","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Comm.

However, MANET is more vulnerable than wired networking. Existing security mechanisms designed for wired networks have to be redesigned in this new environment. In this paper, we discuss the problem of anomaly detection in MANET. The focus of our research is on techniques for automatically constructing anomaly detection models that are capable of detecting new or unseen attacks. We propose a new anomaly detection method for MANET. The proposed method performs cross-feature analysis on the basis of rough sets to capture the inter-feature correlation patterns in normal traffic. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. The results show that proposed method effectively detects anomalies and identify attack types using the intrusion detection method.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1088","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04678996.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Evaluation of an Anomaly Detection Method Based on Cross-Feature Analysis using Rough Sets for MANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4678996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4678996/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Evaluation of an Anomaly Detection Method Based on Cross-Feature Analysis using Rough Sets for MANETs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10356935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4678996/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Evaluation of an Anomaly Detection Method Based on Cross-Feature Analysis using Rough Sets for MANETs","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"05-01-007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042202S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4678996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4679020,"authors":[{"name":"Shanyue Bu","firstName":"Shanyue","lastName":"Bu","id":"37604036300"},{"name":"Ruchuan Wang","firstName":"Ruchuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085946725"},{"name":"Hong Zhou","firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085912509"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4679020","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability and security of the Internet. lt should be more efficient to detect the anomaly of network traffic firstly rather than to analyze the data packets directly.

The aim of this project is to develop an electricity demand predictor. In this paper, we present an Grey-based prediction algorithm to forecast a long-term electric power demand for the demand-control of electricity. We adopted Grey prediction as a forecasting means because of its fast calculation with as few as four data inputs needed. However, our preliminary study shows that the general Grey model, GM(1,1) is inadequate to handle a volatile electrical system. The general GM(1,1) prediction generates the dilemmas of dissipation and overshoots. Based on these influential factors, the corresponding RBF neutal network forecasting model is presented. The proposed algorithm is more robust and reliable as compared to traditional approach and neural networks.In this study, the prediction is corrected significantly by applying the RBF neural network The satisfactory results with better generalization capability and lower prediction error can be obtained. The present intelligent Grey-based electric demand- control system is able to provide an instrument to save operation costs for high energy consuming enterprises. In such a way, the wastage of electric consumption can be avoided. That is, it is another achievement of virtual electric power plant.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1274","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04679182.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grey-RBF Neural Network Prediction Model for City Electricity Demand Forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Cities and towns","Demand forecasting","Economic forecasting","Power markets","Decision making","Electricity supply industry","Prediction algorithms","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power consumption","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey-RBF neural network prediction model","city electricity demand forecasting","power markets","long-term electric power demand","Grey prediction","electric consumption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4679182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Grey-RBF Neural Network Prediction Model for City Electricity Demand Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4679182/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10345499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grey-RBF Neural Network Prediction Model for City Electricity Demand Forecasting","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"05-03-008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05702S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4679182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4679183,"authors":[{"name":"Shengjun Xue","affiliation":["Computer and Software Institute, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shengjun","lastName":"Xue","id":"37396452500"},{"name":"Shaoyong Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shaoyong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085944032"},{"name":"Dongling Bai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dongling","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085944740"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4679183","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Parallel processing","Electronics packaging","Concurrent computing","Application software","Optimized production technology","Space technology","Information analysis","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel genetic algorithm","parallel process","master-slave model","coarse-grained model","fine-grained model","mixed model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4679183","abstract":"With the application of the genetic algorithm (GA) deeply developed, the research of parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) and its realization become very important.

Mathematical model of the above problem is constructed, which reflects the feature of the multi-type vehicle limit and the limited number of vehicles, compatible with MDVRPTW. An improved chromosome representation is proposed on the basis of customer, which can denote the vehicle sent by depot, path and the customer unserviced.

The validity of the algorithm to MDVRPTW with the above- mentioned conditions is proved by the experiments.","doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1502","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04679410.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multi-Type Vehicle Number Limits and its Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4679410/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multi-Type Vehicle Number Limits and its Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4679410/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10357326","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multi-Type Vehicle Number Limits and its Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"06-02-060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059163S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4679410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4679527,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wang","affiliation":["Sch. of Manage., Huazhong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Wuhan"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087444284"},{"name":"Yunfeng Ma","firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086457253"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2107-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4679527","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4679527","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Genetic algorithms","Risk management","Technology management","Costs","Heuristic algorithms","Environmental management","Paper technology","Electronic mail","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","greedy algorithms","integer programming","probability","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location programming","stochastic travel time","genetic algorithm","location-optimization problem","customer site probabilistic","integer programming","greedy-based heuristic algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WiCom.2008.1619","pdfPath":"/iel5/4677908/4677909/04679527.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4677909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiCom.2008.1619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Location Programming under Stochastic Travel Time through Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"This paper considers a location-optimization problem where the classical facility location model is recast in a stochastic environment with several risk factors that make travel time from facility site to customer site probabilistic. We present a Stochastically Travel Time Location Problem (STTLP), a more general set covering problem than classical set covering location problem. Given a discrete network G(V,A), we formulate STTLP as an integer programming under the goal of minimizing the sum of set up cost of selected facilities and opportunity cost of the unserved customers, and then provide a mixed genetic algorithm strategies to solve the variety of size of the problem, the result was analyzed after computational experiment and compared with two greedy-based heuristic algorithms which have proven to be overall the best in solving set covering location problems. The computational experiment shows a good performance of our mixed genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4679527/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10357443","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4679527/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Location Programming under Stochastic Travel Time through Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Location Programming under Stochastic Travel Time through Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"06-02-177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058533S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4677908","isNumber":"4677909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4677908","xplore-issue":"4677909","articleId":"4679527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
