The paper used respectively the three algorithms, namely the Improved GA, LM algorithm and HNNA, to adjust the input and output parameters of the ANN model, and adopt the theories of the fusion of the multi-classifiers to structure the Intrusion Detection System. By repeatedly experiment, it is found that the HNNA is better in stability and convergence precision than LM algorithm and improved GA from the training result. The testing results are also proved that the detection rate of the multiple classifiers intrusion detection system based on HNNA learning algorithm, including all attack categories that has a few or many training samples, is higher than the IDS that use LM and improved GA learning algorithm, and the false negative rate is less. So, the HNNA is proved to be feasible in theory and practice.","doi":"10.1109/ICEBEG.2011.5882041","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779818/5876649/05882041.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBEG.2011.5882041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of Hybrid Neural Network Algorithms in Intrusion Detection System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Intrusion detection","Training","Classification algorithms","Probes","Testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection","neural network","genual algorithm Levenberg-Marquard algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5882041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"The application of Hybrid Neural Network Algorithms in Intrusion Detection System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5882041/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of Hybrid Neural Network Algorithms in Intrusion Detection System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3194AN381003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067868S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5779818","isNumber":"5876649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779818","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5876649","articleId":"5882041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5882343,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Hengzhen","affiliation":["Department of Finance, School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Hengzhen","id":"38015549200"},{"name":"Ma Yinghao","affiliation":["Department of Finance, School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Yinghao","id":"38015554300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8694-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8691-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8693-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5882343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5882343","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Stock markets","Data models","Presses","Finance","Security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Liquidity premium","Reform of non-tradable shares","Panel data"]}],"abstract":"After reform of non-tradable shares to complete, along with limits sells the stock in batches going on the market, the increase of tradable shares proportion has the remarkable influence on liquidity level in China A shares market, thus also changed the liquidity premium.

However, due to frequent machine replacements and upgrades, modern WSCs are in fact composed of diverse commodity microarchitectures and machine configurations. Yet, current WSCs are designed with an assumption of homogeneity, leaving a potentially significant performance opportunity unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the key factors impacting the available heterogeneity in modern WSCs, and the benefit of exploiting this heterogeneity to maximize overall performance. We also introduce a new metric, opportunity factor, which can be used to quantify an application's sensitivity to the heterogeneity in a given WSC. For applications that are sensitive to heterogeneity, we observe a performance improvement of up to 70% when employing our approach. In a WSC composed of state-of-the-art machines, we can improve the overall performance of the entire datacenter by 16% over the status quo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887296/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"July-Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388208","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneity in \u201cHomogeneous\u201d Warehouse-Scale Computers: A Performance Opportunity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneity in \u201cHomogeneous\u201d Warehouse-Scale Computers: A Performance Opportunity","sourcePdf":"lca2011020029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056615S","chronDate":"July-Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"6087356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6087356","articleId":"5887296","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5887304,"authors":[{"name":"Steven M.

Parallel processing provides a promising solution, which partitions a program into multiple small tasks and executes each task concurrently on independent nodes. However, multihop wireless communication is inevitable in such networks and it could have an adverse effect on distributed processing. In this paper, an adaptive intelligent task mapping together with a scheduling scheme based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to provide real-time guarantees. This solution enables efficient parallel processing in a way that only possible node collaborations with cost-effective communications are considered. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the power scarcity of MHWN, a hybrid fitness function is derived and embedded in the algorithm to extend the overall network lifetime via workload balancing among the collaborative nodes, while still ensuring the arbitrary application deadlines. Simulation results show significant performance improvement in various testing environments over existing mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6142500/05887316.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intelligent Task Allocation Scheme for Multihop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent Task Allocation Scheme for Multihop Wireless Networks","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12508981","htmlLink":"/document/5887316/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent Task Allocation Scheme for Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2012030444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072612S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6142500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6142500","articleId":"5887316","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5887317,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Abad","affiliation":["Department of Electr\u00f3nica y Computadores, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Cantabria, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6142500/5887317/5887317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Abad received the BS, MS, and PhD degrees from the University of Cantabria, Spain, in 2003 and 2010, respectively.

The router structure is based on two independent rings, which force packets to circulate either clockwise or counterclockwise, traveling through every port of the router. These two rings constitute a completely decentralized arbitration scheme that enables a simple, but efficient way to connect every input port to every output port. The proposed router is able to avoid network deadlock, livelock, and starvation without requiring data-path modifications. The organization of the router permits the inclusion of throughput enhancement techniques without significantly penalizing the implementation cost. In particular, the router performs adaptive routing, eliminates HOL blocking, and carries out implicit congestion control using simple arbitration and buffering strategies. Additionally, the proposal is capable of avoiding end-to-end deadlock at coherence protocol level with no physical or virtual resource replication, while guaranteeing in-order packet delivery. This facilitates router management and improves storage utilization. Using a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes full-system simulation and hardware description, the proposal is compared with two representative router counterparts. The results obtained demonstrate the Rotary Router's substantial performance and efficiency advantages.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6142500/05887317.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing Performance and Cost in CMP Interconnection Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Balancing Performance and Cost in CMP Interconnection Networks","volume":"23","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5887317/","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12508982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing Performance and Cost in CMP Interconnection Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2012030452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073039S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6142500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6142500","articleId":"5887317","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5887321,"authors":[{"name":"Nihat Altiparmak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas-San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6142500/5887321/5887321-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nihat Altiparmak (S'10) received the BS degree in computer engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2007.

Except for a few cases, it is not possible to find declustering schemes that are optimal for all spatial range queries. As a result of this, most of the research on declustering have focused on finding schemes with low worst case additive error. Number-theoretic declustering techniques provide low additive error and high threshold. In this paper, we investigate equivalent disk allocations and focus on number-theoretic declustering. Most of the number-theoretic disk allocations are equivalent and provide the same additive error and threshold. Investigation of equivalent allocations simplifies schemes to find allocations with desirable properties. By keeping one of the equivalent disk allocations, we can reduce the complexity of searching for good disk allocations under various criteria such as additive error and threshold. Using proposed scheme, we were able to collect the most extensive experimental results on additive error and threshold in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887321/","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5887321/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12508985","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent Disk Allocations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent Disk Allocations","sourcePdf":"ttd2012030538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109075S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6142500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6142500","articleId":"5887321","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5887326,"authors":[{"name":"Pak Chung Wong","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/6168453/5887326/5887326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pak Chung Wong received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of New Hampshire in 1997.

Our fractal-based design approach uses spatial cues to approximate the node connections and thus eliminates the links between the nodes in the visualization. The paper describes a robust algorithm to order the neighboring nodes of a large sparse graph by solving the Fiedler vector of its graph Laplacian, and then fold the graph nodes into a space-filling fractal curve based on the Fiedler vector. The result is a highly compact visualization that gives a succinct overview of the graph with guaranteed visibility of every graph node. GreenCurve is designed with the power grid infrastructure in mind. It is intended for use in conjunction with other visualization techniques to support electric power grid operations. The research and development of GreenCurve was conducted in collaboration with domain experts who understand the challenges and possibilities intrinsic to the power grid infrastructure. The paper reports a case study on applying GreenCurve to a power grid problem and presents a usability study to evaluate the design claims that we set forth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5887326/","accessionNumber":"12592464","pubMedId":"22442128","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Filling Visualization Technique for Multivariate Small-World Graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Filling Visualization Technique for Multivariate Small-World Graphs","sourcePdf":"ttg2012050797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07111S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6168453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6168453","articleId":"5887326","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5887335,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Christen","affiliation":["The Australian National University, College of Engineering and Computer Science, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6247403/5887335/5887335-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Christen received the diploma degree in computer science engineering from ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1995 and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Basel in 1999 (both in Switzerland).

When applied on a single database, this process is known as deduplication. Increasingly, matched data are becoming important in many application areas, because they can contain information that is not available otherwise, or that is too costly to acquire. Removing duplicate records in a single database is a crucial step in the data cleaning process, because duplicates can severely influence the outcomes of any subsequent data processing or data mining. With the increasing size of today's databases, the complexity of the matching process becomes one of the major challenges for record linkage and deduplication. In recent years, various indexing techniques have been developed for record linkage and deduplication. They are aimed at reducing the number of record pairs to be compared in the matching process by removing obvious nonmatching pairs, while at the same time maintaining high matching quality. This paper presents a survey of 12 variations of 6 indexing techniques. Their complexity is analyzed, and their performance and scalability is evaluated within an experimental framework using both synthetic and real data sets. No such detailed survey has so far been published.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2011.127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6247403/05887335.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2011.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6247403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Indexing Techniques for Scalable Record Linkage and Deduplication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Indexing Techniques for Scalable Record Linkage and Deduplication","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5887335/","volume":"24","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Indexing Techniques for Scalable Record Linkage and Deduplication","sourcePdf":"ttk2012091537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107297S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6247403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"6247403","articleId":"5887335","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5887348,"authors":[{"name":"Utsav Prabhu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5989906/5887348/5887348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Utsav Prabhu received the BE degree in electrical and telecommunications engineering from Goa University, Goa, India, in 2006, and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

In this paper, we propose a new method for real-world unconstrained pose-invariant face recognition. We first construct a 3D model for each subject in our database using only a single 2D image by applying the 3D Generic Elastic Model (3D GEM) approach. These 3D models comprise an intermediate gallery database from which novel 2D pose views are synthesized for matching. Before matching, an initial estimate of the pose of the test query is obtained using a linear regression approach based on automatic facial landmark annotation. Each 3D model is subsequently rendered at different poses within a limited search space about the estimated pose, and the resulting images are matched against the test query. Finally, we compute the distances between the synthesized images and test query by using a simple normalized correlation matcher to show the effectiveness of our pose synthesis method to real-world data. We present convincing results on challenging data sets and video sequences demonstrating high recognition accuracy under controlled as well as unseen, uncontrolled real-world scenarios using a fast implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5989906/05887348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989906","startPage":"1952","endPage":"1961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using 3D Generic Elastic Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using 3D Generic Elastic Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206235","pubMedId":"21670487","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887348/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using 3D Generic Elastic Models","sourcePdf":"ttp2011101952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0594S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5989906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5989906","articleId":"5887348","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5887353,"authors":[{"name":"Bryan A.

To account for the interferers, a single-signal likelihood function (SSLF) is proposed which uses maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) in place of nuisance parameters. Since there is uncertainty in signal origin, we propose a computationally efficient method for computing association probabilities. The final proposed SSLF accounts for sidelobe interference from other signals, reflects the uncertainty caused by the array beampattern, is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dependent, and reflects uncertainty caused by unknown signal origin. Various examples are considered, which include moving and stationary targets. For the examples, the sensors are assumed to be uniformly spaced linear arrays. The arrays may be stationary or moving and there may be one or more present.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2151390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5934862/05887353.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2151390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934862","startPage":"386","endPage":"405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian Approach to Passive Sonar Detection and Tracking in the Presence of Interferers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Approach to Passive Sonar Detection and Tracking in the Presence of Interferers","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12093128","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Approach to Passive Sonar Detection and Tracking in the Presence of Interferers","sourcePdf":"joe-lacour-2151390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098765S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5934862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5934862","articleId":"5887353","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5887355,"authors":[{"name":"Chintan P.

The proposed receiver structure employs an adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) in conjunction with adaptive Doppler compensation. The performance of the proposed receiver is compared with an iterative receiver employing turbo-coded BICM (turbo-BICM) and a noniterative receiver employing a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. Experimental results show that the performance of a coding scheme strongly depends on the ability of the adaptive DFE to equalize the time-varying channel. It is also shown that under severe channel conditions the RS code, which is capable of correcting burst errors, fails to give acceptable performance even in the case where perfect decisions were fed back into the DFE. It is, therefore, established that the BICM-based receivers, i.e., turbo-BICM and convolutional BICM-ID, outperform the non-BICM-based receiver. Furthermore, it has been established that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the Doppler correction factor and the receiver performance. In practice, a large Doppler correction factor is required to compensate for severe Doppler effects, however, it leads to noise enhancement in the system. The critical result is that although the proposed convolutional BICM-ID receiver matches approximately the performance of turbo-BICM, it exhibits lower implementation complexity and reduced memory requirements, attributes that are attractive for robust high data-rate underwater acoustic modems.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2144670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2144670","startPage":"406","endPage":"421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5934862/05887355.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative Receiver Structure for Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Shallow Underwater Acoustic Channels Using BICM-ID: Design and Experimental Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative Receiver Structure for Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Shallow Underwater Acoustic Channels Using BICM-ID: Design and Experimental Results","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5887355/","accessionNumber":"12093130","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Iterative Receiver Structure for Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Shallow Underwater Acoustic Channels Using BICM-ID: Design and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"joe-shah-2144670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07454S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5934862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5934862","articleId":"5887355","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5887360,"authors":[{"name":"Joon Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Mobile RF Team, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5983338/5887360/5887360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joon Hyung Kim received the B.S. degree in electronics from Chonbuk National University, Chonju, Korea, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2003.","Since February 2003, he has been with Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea.

For verification, a commercially available 60-W gallium-nitride (GaN) device was used for different types of PA (inverse Class-F and Class-J) with appropriate second harmonic impedance.

In addition, ATCA successfully delivered solutions in other sensitive issues like redundancy, power dissipation and available area for components and routing. Experience has shown, however, that such hardware devices can require a lengthy development. The ATCA specification allows for custom solutions in areas of the interfaces which can be used to define extensions of the standard for instrumentation needs. The\"'xTCA for Physics\" workgroups are currently developing ATCA and MicroTCA extensions for Physics instrumentation applications. These ex tensions will define interfaces in customizable areas which will support functionalities required by the instrumentation and facilitate hardware development and its posterior operation in a Fusion control plant environment-most notably, dedicated timing and input-output (IO) port assignment on the Rear Transition Module (RTM). The prototype hereby presented is a Peripheral Component Interface (PCIe) switch Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) carrier blade. The device serves as a hub, as to control and handle I/O data from its parent nodes existing within the same ATCA shelf through its fabric channels in dual-star topology. Parent node blades, under development, are equally linked through ATCA's agnostic fabric in full-mesh topology, as to attain system MIMO functionality from all I/O endpoints.

We derive two sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithms, which have superior recovery performance compared to existing algorithms, especially in the presence of high temporal correlation. Furthermore, our algorithms are better at handling highly underdetermined problems and require less row-sparsity on the solution matrix. We also provide analysis of the global and local minima of their cost function, and show that the SBL cost function has the very desirable property that the global minimum is at the sparsest solution to the MMV problem.

The solver is optimized for a fast solution of sparse systems of equations arising in computational electromagnetics in a finite element method using higher-order elements. The goal of the tuning is to increase the throughput while at the same time reducing the memory requirements in order to allow one to process very large complex or real systems in single and double precision using commodity graphic processing units (GPUs). A threefold memory footprint reduction is achieved by means of a new format of storing sparse matrices. The acceleration is achieved by optimizing a sparse matrix-vector product on a GPU by applying new features of the Fermi architecture. Further improvements are obtained by introducing more levels into the preconditioner and the application of a fast sparse direct solver for the operations executed on a CPU. Numerical results for a setup consisting of a Fermi GPU (GTX 480) and a Xeon six-core CPU showed that the proposed approach allows one to handle systems involving millions of unknowns and reach the speedup factor of almost 4 compared to the CPU-only implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning a Hybrid GPU-CPU V-Cycle Multilevel Preconditioner for Solving Large Real and Complex Systems of FEM Equations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2159769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/05887385.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2159769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","displayDocTitle":"Tuning a Hybrid GPU-CPU V-Cycle Multilevel Preconditioner for Solving Large Real and Complex Systems of FEM Equations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5887385/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","publicationDate":"2011","accessionNumber":"12092011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning a Hybrid GPU-CPU V-Cycle Multilevel Preconditioner for Solving Large Real and Complex Systems of FEM Equations","sourcePdf":"lawp-dziekonski-2159769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065692S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"5887385","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5887390,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Van Acoleyen","affiliation":["Photonics Research Group, Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University IMEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Van Acoleyen","id":"37586744800"},{"name":"Wim Bogaerts","affiliation":["Photonics Research Group, Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University IMEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Bogaerts","id":"37270431900"},{"name":"Roel Baets","affiliation":["Photonics Research Group, Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University IMEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Baets","id":"37277878900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5887390","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1178},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gratings","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Couplers","Dispersion","Wavelength measurement","Photonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","diffraction gratings","integrated optics","optical dispersion","optical fabrication","optical waveguides","silicon-on-insulator","spectral line shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional dispersive off-chip beam scanner","optical fabrication","silicon-on-insulator","integrated two-dimensional beam steerer","wavelength shift","grating structure","waveguides","Si-SiO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam steering","demultiplexing","grating couplers","silicon-on-insulator (SOI)"]}],"abstract":"One of the key elements in optical wireless applications such as laser scanning and writing is beam steering.

For its estimation, it is often proposed in the literature to use a voice activity detector (VAD). However, using a VAD the estimated matrix can only be updated in speech absence. As a result, during speech presence the noise correlation matrix estimate does not follow changing noise fields with an appropriate accuracy. This effect is further increased, as in nonstationary noise voice activity detection is a rather difficult task, and false-alarms are likely to occur. In this paper, we present and analyze an algorithm that estimates the noise correlation matrix without using a VAD. This algorithm is based on measuring the correlation of the noisy input and a noise reference which can be obtained, e.g., by steering a null towards the target source. When applied in combination with an MVDR beamformer, it is shown that the proposed noise correlation matrix estimate results in a more accurate beamformer response, a larger signal-to-noise ratio improvement and a larger instrumentally predicted speech intelligibility when compared to competing algorithms such as the generalized sidelobe canceler, a VAD-based MVDR beamformer, and an MVDR based on the noisy correlation matrix.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","volume":"20","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12328812","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5887395/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise Correlation Matrix Estimation for Multi-Microphone Speech Enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Correlation Matrix Estimation for Multi-Microphone Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"tasl-hendriks-2159711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082728S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6066252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6066252","articleId":"5887395","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5887401,"authors":[{"name":"Gillian Smith","affiliation":["Expressive Intelligence Studio and the Augmented Design Laboratory, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/6017217/5887401/5887401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gillian Smith (S'10) received the B.S. degree in computer science from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, in 2009, where she is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","She teaches game design and programming in the University of California Santa Cruz COSMOS summer program for high school students.

Discriminative features seem to be crucial for the system to achieve accurate and robust performance. In this paper, we propose a 3-D Gabor-wavelet-based approach for pixel-based hyperspectral imagery classification. A set of complex Gabor wavelets with different frequencies and orientations is first designed to extract signal variances in space, spectrum, and joint spatial/spectral domains. The magnitude of the response at each sampled location (x, y) for spectral band b contains rich information about the signal variances in the local region. Each pixel can be well represented by the rich information extracted by Gabor wavelets. A feature selection and fusion process has also been developed to reduce the redundancy among Gabor features and make the fused feature more discriminative. The proposed approach was fully tested on two real-world hyperspectral data sets, i.e., the widely used Indian Pine site and Kennedy Space Center. The results show that our method achieves as high as 96.04% and 95.36% accuracies, respectively, even when only few samples, i.e., 5% of the total samples per class, are labeled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Gabor Wavelets for Pixel-Based Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2157166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079322/05887411.pdf","startPage":"5039","endPage":"5046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2157166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Gabor Wavelets for Pixel-Based Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5887411/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Gabor Wavelets for Pixel-Based Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-jia-2157166-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093018S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6079322","articleId":"5887411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5887412,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Sauer","affiliation":["Microwaves and Radar Institute (HR), German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059698/5887412/5887412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Sauer received the Diploma degree in mathematics from Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing and telecommunication from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France, in 2008.","From 2004 to 2008, he was a Research Engineer with the SAR Polarimetry, Holography, Interferometry and Radargrammetry Team, Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, University of Rennes 1, where he worked in the field of polarimetric spectral analysis techniques for processing polarimetric multibaseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data.

First, an MB interferometric SAR signal model is generalized to the fully polarimetric configuration, establishing the notion of polarimetric reflectivity. Subsequently, polarimetric beamforming, Capon, and MUSIC methods that determine optimal polarization combinations for height estimation are developed. These new techniques allow for extracting the height of reflectors, the associated scattering mechanisms, and the polarimetric (pseudo)reflectivities. By means of polarimetric dual-baseline interferometric SAR observations of an urban environment, the performance of the conceived algorithms is examined in detail.

For these purposes, this paper has taken the tendency prediction of the thermal state of BFH as a binary classification problem and constructed a \u03bd-support vector machines (SVMs) model and a probabilistic output model based on \u03bd-SVMs for predicting its tendency change. A highly efficient ordinal-validation algorithm is proposed to combine with the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i>\n-score method to single out inputs from all collected blast furnace variables, which are then fed into the constructed models to perform the predictive task. The final predictive results indicate that these two models both can serve as competitive tools for the current predictive task. In particular, for the probabilistic output model, it can give not only the direct result whether the next thermal state will get hot or cool down but also the confidence level for this result. All these results can act as a guide to aid the blast furnace operators for judging the thermal state change of BFH in time and further provide an indication for them to determine the direction of controlling blast furnaces in advance. Of course, it is necessary to develop a graphical user interface in order to online help the plant operators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887413/","accessionNumber":"12300513","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the Thermal State Change of Blast Furnace Hearth With Support Vector Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the Thermal State Change of Blast Furnace Hearth With Support Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-gao-2159693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099106S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5887413","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5887415,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

A coarse registration approach based on control points (CPs) is presented to obtain the initial perspective parameters. This approach exploits two constraints to solve the problem with a very limited number of CPs. One is named the point-point-line topology constraint, and the other is named the color and intensity distribution of segment constraint. Both of the constraints describe the consistency between the reference and sensed images. To obtain a finer registration, we have converted the perspective deformation into affine deformations in local image patches so that affine refinements can be used readily. Then, the local affine parameters that have been refined are utilized to recover precise perspective parameters of a ROI. Moreover, the location and dimension selections of local image patches are discussed by mathematical demonstrations to avoid the aperture effect. Experiments on simulated data and real-world sequences demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed method. The experimental results of image super-resolution are also provided, which show a possible practical application of our method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2159731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106034","startPage":"53","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6106034/05887416.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coarse-to-Fine Subpixel Registration Method to Recover Local Perspective Deformation in the Application of Image Super-Resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887416/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Coarse-to-Fine Subpixel Registration Method to Recover Local Perspective Deformation in the Application of Image Super-Resolution","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425576","pubMedId":"21690012","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coarse-to-Fine Subpixel Registration Method to Recover Local Perspective Deformation in the Application of Image Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"tip-liao-2159731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098354S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6106034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6106034","articleId":"5887416","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5887421,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Albiol","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/5887421/5887421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Albiol received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 1987 and 1993, respectively.","He is currently a Professor, teaching digital signal processing with the Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.

The system has been evaluated using private and public data sets and has proven to be robust against common difficulties found in closed-circuit television video, such as varying illumination, camera vibration, the presence of momentary occlusion by other vehicles, and high noise levels.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2156791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6082048/05887421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2156791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082048","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Parked Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Parked Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Maps","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12402786","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887421/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Parked Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Maps","sourcePdf":"tits-albiol-2156791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068551S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6082048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6082048","articleId":"5887421","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5887423,"authors":[{"name":"Kalle Ilves","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6099646/5887423/5887423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalle Ilves (S\u201910) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2009.

In this paper, we aim to develop an unsupervised feature ranking algorithm that evaluates features using discovered local coherent patterns, which are known as biclusters. The biclusters (viewed as submatrices) are discovered from a data matrix. These submatrices are used for scoring relevant features from two aspects, i.e., the interdependence of features and the separability of instances. The features are thereby ranked with respect to their accumulated scores from the total discovered biclusters before the pattern classification. Experimental results show that this proposed method can yield comparable or even better performance in comparison with the well-known Fisher score, Laplacian score, and variance score using three UCI data sets, well improve the results of gene expression data analysis using gene ontology annotation, and finally demonstrate its advantage of unsupervised feature ranking for high-dimensional data.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2151256","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6006807/05887432.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2151256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Local Coherent Patterns for Unsupervised Feature Ranking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Local Coherent Patterns for Unsupervised Feature Ranking","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12359977","pubMedId":"21690016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5887432/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Local Coherent Patterns for Unsupervised Feature Ranking","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-li-2151256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077555S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6006807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6006807","articleId":"5887432","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5887436,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoshi Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoshi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37598425500"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Robert G.

A distributed base-station (BS)-cooperation-aided soft reception scheme using the probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm and soft combining (SC) is proposed for the uplink of multiuser multicell MIMO systems. The realistic 19-cell hexagonal cellular model relying on unity FR is considered, where both the BSs and the mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with multiple antennas. Local-cooperation-based message passing is used, instead of a global message passing chain for the sake of reducing the backhaul traffic. The PDA algorithm is employed as a low-complexity solution for producing soft information, which facilitates the employment of SC at the individual BSs to generate the final soft decision metric. Our simulations and analysis demonstrate that, despite its low additional complexity and backhaul traffic, the proposed distributed PDA-aided SC (DPDA-SC) reception scheme significantly outperforms the conventional noncooperative benchmarkers. Furthermore, since only the index of the possible discrete value of the quantized converged soft information has to be exchanged for SC in practice, the proposed DPDA-SC scheme is relatively robust to the quantization errors of the soft information exchanged. As a beneficial result, the backhaul traffic is dramatically reduced at negligible performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05887436.pdf","startPage":"3532","endPage":"3538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2159822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2159822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Probabilistic-Data-Association-Based Soft Reception Employing Base Station Cooperation in MIMO-Aided Multiuser Multicell Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Personal digital assistants","Interference","Complexity theory","Channel estimation","Indexes","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","cooperative communication","diversity reception","interference suppression","message passing","probability","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed probabilistic-data-association","soft reception","base station cooperation","MIMO-aided multiuser multicell systems","intercell cochannel interference mitigation","frequency reuse","soft combining","19-cell hexagonal cellular model","mobile stations","message passing","quantization errors","soft information","backhaul traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base station (BS) cooperation","cochannel interference (CCI)","distributed multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","message passing","multicell processing","probabilistic data association (PDA)","soft combining (SC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Probabilistic-Data-Association-Based Soft Reception Employing Base Station Cooperation in MIMO-Aided Multiuser Multicell Systems","volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5887436/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219103","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Probabilistic-Data-Association-Based Soft Reception Employing Base Station Cooperation in MIMO-Aided Multiuser Multicell Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2159822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066329S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5887436","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5887439,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537359500"},{"name":"Mark Karpovsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Karpovsky","id":"37275727100"},{"name":"Ajay Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37933305900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5887439","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1263},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Computer architecture","Ash","Error correction codes","Linear code","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","NAND circuits","nonlinear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear multierror correction code","reliable MLC NAND flash memories","multilevel cell NAND flash memories","Hamming distance","nonlinear multierror correcting code","Vasil'ev code","nonlinear bit error correction","digit error correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-error correcting codes","nonlinear codes","reliable memory"]}],"abstract":"Multi-level cell (MLC) nand flash memories are popular storage media because of their power efficiency and large storage density.

Moreover, codes generated by the generalized Vasil'ev construction can correct some errors with multiplicities larger than \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n without any extra overhead in area, latency, and power consumption compared to schemes where only errors with multiplicity up to \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n are corrected. The design of reliable MLC nand flash architectures can be based on the proposed nonlinear multi-error correcting codes. The reliability, area overhead and the penalty in latency and power consumption of the architectures based on the proposed codes are compared to architectures based on BCH codes and RS codes. The results show that using the proposed nonlinear error correcting codes for the protection of MLC nand flash memories can reduce the number of errors undetected or miscorrected for all codewords to be almost 0 at the cost of less than 20% increase in power and area compared to architectures based on BCH codes and RS codes.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2157183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6210451/05887439.pdf","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2157183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Multi-Error Correction Codes for Reliable MLC nand Flash Memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Multi-Error Correction Codes for Reliable MLC nand Flash Memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5887439/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12769230","volume":"20","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Multi-Error Correction Codes for Reliable MLC nand Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2157183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047446S","chronDate":"July  2012","isNumber":"6210451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5887439","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5888501,"authors":[{"name":"John B.

The automotive industry is working to develop the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology, for use in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communication. The effectiveness of this technology is highly dependent on cooperative standards for interoperability. This paper explains the content and status of the DSRC standards being developed for deployment in the United States. Included in the discussion are the IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), the IEEE 1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Services and Multi-Channel Operation, the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary, and the emerging SAE J2945.1 Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard. The paper shows how these standards fit together to provide a comprehensive solution for DSRC. Most of the key standards are either recently published or expected to be completed in the coming year. A reader will gain a thorough understanding of DSRC technology for vehicular communication, including insights into why specific technical solutions are being adopted, and key challenges remaining for successful DSRC deployment. The U.S. Department of Transportation is planning to decide in 2013 whether to require DSRC equipment in new vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2132790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2132790","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1182","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5888494/05888501.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5888494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) Standards in the United States","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5888501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) Standards in the United States","volume":"99","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12068470","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5888501/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) Standards in the United States","sourcePdf":"jproc-kenney-2132790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078114S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5888494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1179","xplore-issue":"5888494","articleId":"5888501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5888634,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Mishali","affiliation":["Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Haifa, IL"],"bio":{"p":["Moshe Mishali (moshiko@tx.technion.ac.il) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineeing from the Technion, Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel."]},"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Mishali","id":"37393330300"},{"name":"Yonina C.

The next section briefly summarizes existing approaches to CR sensing. The advantages of our system with respect to current architectures are threefold. First, our analog front end is fixed and does not involve scanning hardware. Second, both the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and the digital signal processing (DSP) rates are substantially below Nyquist. Finally, the sensing resources are shared with the reception path of the CR, so that the low-rate streaming samples can be used for communication purposes of the device, besides the sensing functionality they provide. Combining these advantages leads to a real-time map of the spectrum with minimal use of mobile resources. Our approach is based on the modulated wideband converter (MWC) system, which samples sparse wideband inputs at sub-Nyquist rates. We report on results of hardware experiments, conducted on an MWC prototype circuit, which affirm fast and accurate spectrum sensing in parallel to CR communication. This can help alleviate one of the current main bottlenecks in wide-spreading deployment of CRs.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2011.941094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5888632/05888634.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2011.941094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5888632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing at Sub-Nyquist Rates [Applications Corner]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5888634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5888634/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing at Sub-Nyquist Rates [Applications Corner]","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12062899","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5888634/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing at Sub-Nyquist Rates [Applications Corner]","sourcePdf":"28msp04-applications.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074639S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5888632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5888632","articleId":"5888634","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5888642,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Video Compression, Networked Media Systems, Image Based Retrieval, German National Academy of Sciences, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Bernd Girod (bGirod@stanford.edu) received his engineering doctorate from the University of Hannover, Germany, and his M.S. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology.
