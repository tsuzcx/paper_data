Although several hardware- and software-based approaches have been proposed so far, this issue still remains unsolved due to the very high difficulty in finding effective features for detecting the fingerprint liveness. In this paper, we present a novel features set, based on the local phase quantization (LPQ) of fingerprint images. LPQ method is well-known for being insensitive to blurring effects, thus we believe it could be useful for detecting the differences between an alive and a fake fingerprint, due to the loss of information which may occur during the replica fabrication process. The method is tested on the four data sets of the Second International Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition, and shows promising and competitive results with other state-of-the-art features sets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460190.pdf","endPage":"540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint liveness detection by local phase quantization","startPage":"537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint liveness detection by local phase quantization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460190/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13324608","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6460190/","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint liveness detection by local phase quantization","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0137MoBT501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036978S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6460290,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Media Innovation, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38007362300"},{"name":"Martin Constable","affiliation":["School of Art, Design and Media, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Constable","id":"37938650600"},{"name":"Kap Luk Chan","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Kap Luk","lastName":"Chan","id":"37276025400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9906441-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6460290","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460290","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Painting","Smoothing methods","Skin","Face","Image color analysis","Media","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["art","image enhancement","image restoration","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based contrast enhancement","snap-shot style portrait photographs","premodern portrait paintings","aesthetic exemplars","reference portrait painting","contrast style","interregional contrast mapping","intraregional contrast mapping","two-part partial contrast stretching method","transition boundary smoothing","nonfigure region blurring"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an approach whereby the regional contrasts in snap-shot style portrait photographs are enhanced using pre-modern portrait paintings as aesthetic exemplars.

The method computes a binary code for each pixel by linearly projecting local image patches onto a subspace, whose basis vectors are learnt from natural images via independent component analysis, and by binarizing the coordinates in this basis via thresholding. The length of the binary code string is determined by the number of basis vectors. Image regions can be conveniently represented by histograms of pixels' binary codes. Our method is inspired by other descriptors which produce binary codes, such as local binary pattern and local phase quantization. However, instead of heuristic code constructions, the proposed approach is based on statistics of natural images and this improves its modeling capacity. The experimental results show that our method improves accuracy in texture recognition tasks compared to the state-of-the-art.","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1366","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460393.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BSIF: Binarized statistical image features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460393/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"BSIF: Binarized statistical image features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6460393/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13324804","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BSIF: Binarized statistical image features","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0341TuPSBT213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043292S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6460434,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

We demonstrate experimentally to what extent the graphs sampled by our method reproduce the salient properties of the graphs in the original training sample.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460462.pdf","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling graphs from a probabilistic generative model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sampling graphs from a probabilistic generative model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6460462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324871","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460462/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling graphs from a probabilistic generative model","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0411TuDT304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048732S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6460472,"authors":[{"name":"Likun Huang","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Likun","lastName":"Huang","id":"38195453000"},{"name":"Jiwen Lu","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiwen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404390100"},{"name":"Yap-Peng Tan","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yap-Peng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274878200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9906441-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6460472","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of heterogeneous face recognition where the gallery and probe face samples are captured from two different modalities. Due to large discrepancies yet weak relationships across heterogeneous face image sets, most existing face recognition algorithms usually suffer from this application scenario. To address this problem, we propose in this paper to learn modality-invariant features (MIF) for heterogeneous face recognition. In our proposed method, a pair of heterogeneous face datasets are used as generic training datasets, and the relationship between both gallery and probe samples and generic training datasets are computed as modality-invariant features for matching heterogeneous face images. The rationale of our method is motivated by the fact the local geometrical information of each pair of heterogeneous face samples are usually similar in the corresponding generic training sets. Experimental results are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460472.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1686","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning modality-invariant features for heterogeneous face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Probes","Vectors","Feature extraction","Visualization","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","geometry","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modality-invariant feature learning","heterogeneous face recognition problem","gallery","probe face samples","heterogeneous face image sets","MIF","heterogeneous face datasets","generic training datasets","heterogeneous face image matching","local geometrical information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Learning modality-invariant features for heterogeneous face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6460472/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324881","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning modality-invariant features for heterogeneous face recognition","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0421TuDT504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071044S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6460481,"authors":[{"name":"Billy Y L Li","affiliation":["Ept. of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Billy Y L","lastName":"Li","id":"37899251500"},{"name":"Wanquan Liu","affiliation":["Ept. of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Wanquan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279767200"},{"name":"Senjian An","affiliation":["Ept. of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Senjian","lastName":"An","id":"37277638600"},{"name":"Aneesh Krishna","affiliation":["Ept. of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Aneesh","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37271880200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9906441-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6460481","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Image color analysis","Face recognition","Face","Lighting","Training","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image colour analysis","image reconstruction","image representation","least squares approximations","lighting","pose estimation","tensors","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor-based robust color face recognition","pose illumination","facial expression","multilinear color tensor discriminant model","MCTD model","tensor representation","image structure preservation","color space transformation","multilinear analysis technique","pose handling","reconstruction error least square","CMU-PIE database","CurtinFaces databases"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we address the robust face recognition problem for color faces with large variations in pose, illumination and facial expression.

The proposed framework essentially turns the complex anomaly detection process into two parts: motion pattern representation and spatio-temporal context modeling. We propose a new 4D spatio-temporal hypervolume representation by integrating the depth constraints to enrich motion information. When detecting abnormal behaviors from crowded scenes, we divide the hypervolume into local blocks and construct environmental contexts by coupling their spatio-temporal correlations together with the co-occurrence probabilities. As a result, statistical deviations can be detected as abnormal events. Experiments on a new depth image dataset composed of four crowded scene categories show that our spatiotemporal framework offers promising results in real-life crowded scenes with complex activities.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460697.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","startPage":"2590","endPage":"2593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection with spatio-temporal context using depth images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection with spatio-temporal context using depth images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460697/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6460697/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325102","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection with spatio-temporal context using depth images","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0646WePSBT239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044849S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6460719,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Fiaschi","affiliation":["HCI/IWR Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fiaschi","id":"38547699800"},{"name":"Ullrich Koethe","affiliation":["HCI/IWR Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ullrich","lastName":"Koethe","id":"38015983100"},{"name":"Rahul Nair","affiliation":["HCI/IWR Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Nair","id":"38548472700"},{"name":"Fred A.

In order to retrieve efficiently one or several images in a database, the development of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems has become an intensively active research area. However, most proposed systems are keyword-based and few imply the end-user during the search (through relevance feedback). Visual low-level descriptors are then substituted to keywords but there is a gap between visual description and user expectations. We propose a new framework which combines a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm, allowing a trade-off between image features and user evaluations, and a support vector machine to learn the user relevance feedback. We test our system on SIMPLIcity database, commonly used in the literature to evaluate CBIR systems using a genetic algorithm, and it outperforms the recent frameworks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460759/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13325164","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6460759/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybdrid Content Based Image Retrieval combining multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm and SVM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybdrid Content Based Image Retrieval combining multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm and SVM","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0709ThPSAT106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0497S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6460867,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Sermanet","affiliation":["The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Sermanet","id":"37680831200"},{"name":"Soumith Chintala","affiliation":["The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Soumith","lastName":"Chintala","id":"38547691300"},{"name":"Yann LeCun","affiliation":["The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"LeCun","id":"37282875900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9906441-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6460867","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2807},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Feature extraction","Training","Biological neural networks","Convolutional codes","Error analysis","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","house number digit classification","ConvNets","hierarchical feature learning neural network","biologically inspired structure","feature optimization","multistage feature","Lp pooling method","SVHN dataset","source code","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"We classify digits of real-world house numbers using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).

However, there are many tunable parameters in ordinal filters which can generate an over-complete feature pool. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method based on linear programming, which can learn a compact and effective ordinal feature set for iris recognition. Firstly, large margin principle is employed to obtain strong generalization capacity. Secondly, discriminative information for each feature is added to make the model more robust to noise. Finally, non-negative weight is not only interpretable but also suitable for a linear model. Additionally, the model can be efficiently solved by the Simplex algorithm. The comparative experiments are conducted on CASIA-Iris-V4 database, and the results show that our method has outperformed other state-of-the-art feature selection methods, including Adaboost and Sparsity based methods.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425799/6460043/06460884.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460043","startPage":"3358","endPage":"3361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust regularized feature selection for iris recognition via linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust regularized feature selection for iris recognition via linear programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6460884/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325285","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6460884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust regularized feature selection for iris recognition via linear programming","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"0835ThBT404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063395S","chronDate":"11-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425799","isNumber":"6460043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425799","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6460043","articleId":"6460884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICPR Org Committee","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6460889,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyang Wang","affiliation":["Department of ECSE, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38548539500"},{"name":"Qiang Ji","affiliation":["Department of ECSE, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37268501800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-9906441-0-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"6460889","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6460889","abstract":"This paper proposes a new Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) to incorporate the scene, event object interaction and the event temporal contexts into Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) for event recognition in surveillance videos.

First discovered in 2009 on iOS, and again in 2011 on Mac OS X, the vulnerability exists in a feature which seeks to help the device user maintain internet connectivity when attached to open WiFi networks protected by a captive portal. Since many modern applications rely on an internet connection, to alert a user when the connection requires user input to proceed, vulnerable OSs periodically check for a connection to the Apple URL http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html. When the response returned from the connection check is abnormal, a UIWebView instance is opened, allowing the user to accept a terms of service, or otherwise satisfy the Captive Portal or Paywall terms. This behavior allows an adversary a small window of opportunity to launch an attack, which can manifest as an ARP Poisoning Attack, DNS Poisoning Attack, or a Man-in-the-Middle Attack redirecting the requesting iOS device to a malicious location. We have confirmed this vulnerability continues to exist in both iOS 4 and iOS 5. Further we have compared both native as well as jailbroken devices, and successfully launched a BeEF hook to both with equal results. The danger of this vulnerability lies in the fact that no user intervention is requiredfor exploitation beyond initially joining the network, which is a common and generally accepted user activity.","doi":"10.1109/MALWARE.2012.6461013","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449416/6460999/06461013.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MALWARE.2012.6461013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring an open WiFi detection vulnerability as a malware attack vector on iOS devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring an open WiFi detection vulnerability as a malware attack vector on iOS devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13309971","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461013/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461013/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring an open WiFi detection vulnerability as a malware attack vector on iOS devices","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"rp141569655775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034908S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449416","isNumber":"6460999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449416","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6460999","articleId":"6461013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461032,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Mokhtar","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6461032/6461032-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Mokhtar received BSc degree in electronics and communications engineering from Alexandria University, Egypt, in 2008 and MSc from Nile University, Egypt, in 2010.

CSMA protocols aim to maximize the spatial frequency reuse while limiting the mutual interference and outage. The hard core point process (HCPP) is a very popular tool for modeling and analysis of random CSMA networks. However, the traditional HCPP suffers from the node intensity (and hence the interference) underestimation flaw. Therefore, we propose a modified hard core point process to mitigate this flaw. The proposed modified HCPP is generalized for any fading environment. To this end, we derive a closed-form expression for the intensity of simultaneously active transmitters in a random wireless CSMA network. Then, we derive a closed-form expression for approximating the outage probability experienced by a generic receiver in the network, and subsequently, use it to obtain the transmission capacity of the network. Finally, we show the existence of an optimal carrier-sensing threshold for the CSMA protocol that maximizes the transmission capacity of the network. Simulation results validate the analysis and also provide interesting insights into the design of practical CSMA networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06461033.pdf","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Hard Core Point Process for Analysis of Random CSMA Wireless Networks in General Fading Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461033/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Hard Core Point Process for Analysis of Random CSMA Wireless Networks in General Fading Environments","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487682","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461033/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Hard Core Point Process for Analysis of Random CSMA Wireless Networks in General Fading Environments","sourcePdf":"1520-tc1304-elsawy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087709S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6461033","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6461034,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In contrast with previously proposed methods, which entailed repeated transmissions from all the nodes in the network, this new algorithm requires each node to transmit only once during the synchronization cycle. This drastically reduces the amount of power consumed to achieve phase alignment, yet the new algorithm converges at least as fast as all other existing schemes. In contrast with previous analyses of distributed beamforming based on random phase updates, where noise had been disregarded, here it is explicitly included in the models and shown to have a considerable effect that cannot be ignored. With and without noise, analytical expressions that characterize the performance of the new algorithm are provided, with emphasis on various limiting regimes of interest.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1607","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06461034.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Deterministic Distributed Beamforming Algorithms in the Presence of Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461034/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Deterministic Distributed Beamforming Algorithms in the Presence of Noise","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487683","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Deterministic Distributed Beamforming Algorithms in the Presence of Noise","sourcePdf":"1595-tc1304-thibault.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106987S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6461034","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461035,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6461035/6461035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Xu (S'09) received a B.Eng. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and a BSc(Eng) with First Class Honours from Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK, through a Sino-UK joint degree program in 2008, both in Telecommunications Enginneering with Management.

Although the detectors of Gray-labelled low-order PSK/QAM schemes generally produce near-horizontal EXIT curves, our proposed detectors exploit the a priori LLRs gleaned from a channel decoder in order to retain the optimum detection capability for all PSK/QAM constellations. Furthermore, we demonstrate in this paper that the widely applied MIMO schemes including V-BLAST and STBC, which invoke the proposed soft PSK/QAM detectors may also benefit from our reduced-complexity design. Our simulation results confirm that a near-capacity performance may be achieved by the proposed detectors at a substantially reduced detection complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Phase shift keying","Complexity theory","Detectors","Measurement","Tin","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity approx-log-MAP","Max-Log-MAP Soft PSK detection","QAM detection algorithm","generalized PSK detection","gray-labelled low-order PSK/QAM scheme","near-horizontal EXIT curve","channel decoder","MIMO scheme","V-BLAST","STBC","PSK-QAM constellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reduced-complexity","approx-log-MAP","max- log-MAP","turbo detection","bit metric generation","Gray-labelling","PSK","square QAM","star QAM","cross QAM","V-BLAST","STBC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.110683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06461035.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.110683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Approx-Log-MAP and Max-Log-MAP Soft PSK/QAM Detection Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Approx-Log-MAP and Max-Log-MAP Soft PSK/QAM Detection Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461035/","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461035/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13487684","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Approx-Log-MAP and Max-Log-MAP Soft PSK/QAM Detection Algorithms","sourcePdf":"1415-tc1304-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061786S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6461035","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6461050,"authors":[{"name":"Jianshu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716524000"},{"name":"Ali H.

The problem is equivalent to optimizing a global cost that is the sum of individual components. The optimizers of the individual components do not necessarily coincide and the network therefore needs to seek Pareto optimal solutions. We develop a distributed solution that relies on a general class of adaptive diffusion strategies. We show how the diffusion process can be represented as the cascade composition of three operators: two combination operators and a gradient descent operator. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we establish the existence of a unique fixed point for the composite cascade. We then study how close each agent converges towards this fixed point, and also examine how close the Pareto solution is to the fixed point. We perform a detailed mean-square error analysis and establish that all agents are able to converge to the same Pareto optimal solution within a sufficiently small mean-square-error (MSE) bound even for constant step-sizes. We illustrate one application of the theory to collaborative decision making in finance by a network of agents.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246763","startPage":"205","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6477092/06461050.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Pareto Optimization via Diffusion Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Pareto Optimization via Diffusion Strategies","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13382436","publicationDate":"April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Pareto Optimization via Diffusion Strategies","sourcePdf":"jstsp-sayed-2246763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063061S","chronDate":"April  2013","isNumber":"6477092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"114","articleId":"6461050","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6461055,"authors":[{"name":"Josep M.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the peak obtainable power levels in a wireless myoelectric sensor implanted in a patient while maintaining safe local temperature and RF powering conditions. This can serve as a guide for the design of onboard electronics in related medical implants and provide motivation for more efficient power management strategies for implantable integrated circuits. Safe powering conditions and peak received power levels are established using a simplified theoretical analysis and Federal Communications Commission-established limits for radiating antennas. These conditions are subsequently affirmed and improved upon using the finite-element method and temperature modeling in bovine muscle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655161","htmlLink":"/document/6461073/","pubMedId":"23412566","displayDocTitle":"Far-Field RF Powering of Implantable Devices: Safety Considerations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-Field RF Powering of Implantable Devices: Safety Considerations","sourcePdf":"tbme-bercich-2246787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05676S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6558849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6558849","articleId":"6461073","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461083,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6461083/6461083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Myung-Jae Lee (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree."]},"firstName":"Myung-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37598674000"},{"name":"Woo-Young Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6461083/6461083-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Woo-Young Choi (M'92) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea."]},"firstName":"Woo-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281363600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6461083","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461083","abstract":"We investigate the area-dependent characteristics of photodetection frequency responses of 850-nm silicon avalanche photodetectors (APDs) fabricated with standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.

These criteria, named p-optimality criteria, allow us to value (assess) the relative importance of those solutions with outstanding performance in very few objectives and poor performance in all others, regarding those solutions with an equilibrium (balance) among all the objectives. The optimality criteria avoid interrelating the relative values of the different objectives, respecting the integrity of each one in a rational way. As an example, a simple multi-objective approach based on the p-optimality criteria and genetic algorithms is designed, where solutions used to generate new solutions are selected according to the proposed optimality criteria. It is implemented and applied on several benchmark test problems, and its performance is compared to that of the nondominated sort genetic algorithm-II method, in order to analyze the contribution and potential of these new optimality criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2243455","startPage":"167","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2243455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6779627/06461089.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization by Using Evolutionary Algorithms: The --Optimality Criteria","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461089/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization by Using Evolutionary Algorithms: The <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$p$</tex></formula>-Optimality Criteria","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6461089/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14196627","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization by Using Evolutionary Algorithms: The <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$p$</tex></formula>-Optimality Criteria","sourcePdf":"tevc-carrenojara-2243455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064326S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6779627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6779627","articleId":"6461089","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461099,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Basanta-Val","affiliation":["Departarmento de Ingenier\u00eda de Telem\u00e1tica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Madrid"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6683081/6461099/6461099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Basanta-Val was born in O Valadouro, Lugo, Spain.

Although many industrial systems use these technologies at their business layers, they are far from offering a homogeneous programming platform in their most internal infrastructures. This paper extends the current practice by introducing a real-time Java-centric architecture for industrial systems. The architecture integrates existing and upcoming technology to define a Java-based approach.

This is due to the fact that supervised models most often capture patterns of existing observations and not those related to the whole population. This results in models that do not generalize well to new, undiscovered images. This article proposes a methodology to reduce overfitting when ranking high-resolution satellite images by domain semantics. Our approach uses PathFinder Network Scaling ensemble methods. We generate cross-fold co-occurrence measures for relevance of feature subspaces to each semantic. Each matrix is then reduced using the PathFinder network scaling algorithm. Irrelevant nodes are removed using node strength metrics resulting in an optimized model for ranking by semantic that generalizes better to new images. The results show that, when using this approach, the quality of ranking by semantic can be significantly improved. Mean Average Precision (MAP) of ranking over cross-fold experiments increased by 13.2% while standard deviation of MAP was reduced by 16.8% relative to experiments without PathFinder network scaling.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6541987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6541987/06461103.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2242254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2242254","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of PathFinder Network Scaling for Improving the Ranking of Satellite Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461103/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of PathFinder Network Scaling for Improving the Ranking of Satellite Images","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461103/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13583004","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of PathFinder Network Scaling for Improving the Ranking of Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-barb-2242254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06646S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6541987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6541987","articleId":"6461103","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6461104,"authors":[{"name":"Lael U.

Taking inspiration from the human grasping strategy for picking up objects from a flat surface, we introduce the flip-and-pinch task, in which the hand picks up a thin object by flipping it into a stable configuration between two fingers. Despite the fact that finger motions are not fully constrained by the hand actuators, we demonstrate that the hand and fingers can interact with the table surface to produce a set of constraints that result in a repeatable quasi-static motion trajectory. Even when utilizing only open-loop kinematic playback, this approach is shown to be robust to variation in object size and hand position. Variation of up to 20\u00b0 in orientation and 10 mm in hand height still result in experimental success rates of 80% or higher. These results suggest that the advantages of underactuated, adaptive robot hands can be carried over from basic grasping tasks to more dexterous tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2013.2240298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6549150/06461104.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2013.2240298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-Loop Precision Grasping With Underactuated Hands Inspired by a Human Manipulation Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Open-Loop Precision Grasping With Underactuated Hands Inspired by a Human Manipulation Strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461104/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13599288","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-Loop Precision Grasping With Underactuated Hands Inspired by a Human Manipulation Strategy","sourcePdf":"tase-dollar-2240298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046646S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6549150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6549150","articleId":"6461104","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6461107,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Atef","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6547190/6461107/6461107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Atef (M'12) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering, electronics and communications from Assiut University, Egypt, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

Unlike traditional ac distribution systems, protection has been challenging for dc systems. The goals of the proposed scheme are to detect the fault in the bus between devices and to isolate the faulted section so that the system keeps operating without disabling the entire system. To achieve these goals, a loop-type dc-bus-based microgrid system, which has a segment controller between connected components, is proposed. The segment controller consists of master and slave controllers that monitor currents and control the segment separation, which include solid-state bidirectional switches and snubber circuits. The proposed system can detect faults on the bus regardless of fault current amplitude or the power supply's feeding capacity. The proposed concepts have been verified by OrCAD/PSpice simulations and experiments on hardware test bed.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2243478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6484160/06461119.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2243478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Low-Voltage DC-Bus Microgrid System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461119/","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Low-Voltage DC-Bus Microgrid System","volume":"28","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461119/","publicationDate":"April 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13396779","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Low-Voltage DC-Bus Microgrid System","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-park-2243478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050297S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6484160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6484160","articleId":"6461119","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461125,"authors":[{"name":"Umberto Pogliano","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Division, Istituto Nationale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM), Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6514981/6461125/6461125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Umberto Pogliano was born in Lein\u00ec, Italy, in 1950.

The algorithm is based on multivariate polynomial interpolation and root-finding over extension fields. It was noted by Vadhan that interpolating a linear polynomial suffices for a statement of the above form. Here, we give a simple linear-algebra-based analysis of this variant that eliminates the need for the computationally expensive root-finding step over extension fields (and indeed any mention of extension fields). The entire list-decoding algorithm is linear-algebraic, solving one linear system for the interpolation step, and another linear system to find a small subspace of candidate solutions. Except for the step of pruning this subspace, the algorithm can be implemented to run in quadratic time. We also consider a closely related family of codes, called (order \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n) derivative codes and defined over fields of large characteristic, which consist of the evaluations of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n as well as its first \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n-1 formal derivatives at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n distinct field elements.

Three converters, including a CLL converter, an interleaved noninverting buck-boost (BB) converter, and a noninverting BB converter, with voltage balancing function and state-of-charge balancing function are built to verify the feasibility of the proposed balancing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2246584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6525347/06461131.pdf","startPage":"5927","endPage":"5939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2246584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel High-Efficiency Compact-Size Low-Cost Balancing Method for Series-Connected Battery Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Novel High-Efficiency Compact-Size Low-Cost Balancing Method for Series-Connected Battery Applications","volume":"28","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13539100","htmlLink":"/document/6461131/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel High-Efficiency Compact-Size Low-Cost Balancing Method for Series-Connected Battery Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-hsieh-2246584-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081487S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6525347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6525347","articleId":"6461131","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461132,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38023797900"},{"name":"Wei Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37545084000"},{"name":"Long Wu","affiliation":["John Deere Electronic Solutions, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290618100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6461132","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2503},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Observers","Torque","Trajectory","Sensorless control","Stators","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","braking","digital control","discrete time systems","electric potential","hybrid electric vehicles","machine testing","observers","parameter estimation","permanent magnet machines","position control","robust control","sensorless machine control","synchronous machines","transport control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive quasisliding-mode rotor position observer-based sensorless control","interior permanent magnet synchronous machine","parameter insensitivity","robustness","digital controller","QSMO","discrete-time system","EMF","electromotive force","online parameter adaption scheme","rotor position estimation","IPMSM drive system","hybrid electric vehicle","ramp torque testing","four-quadrant operation testing","complete torque reversal testing","braking mode","power 150 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive observer","interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM)","position estimation","quasi-sliding-mode observer (QSMO)","sensorless control"]}],"abstract":"Advantages such as parameter insensitivity and high robustness to system structure uncertainty make the sliding-mode observer (SMO) a promising solution for sensorless control of interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs). In practical industry applications, in order to utilize digital controllers and achieve comparable performance under a lower sampling frequency, a discrete-time or quasi-SMO (QSMO) is commonly used. However, because of the saliency of an IPMSM, the magnitude of the extended electromotive force (EMF) will change with load (torque and/or speed) variations, which makes it challenging for the QSMO to estimate the extended EMF accurately. Without proper observer parameters, a phase shift will be observed in the QSMO-estimated rotor position when the load changes. In order to overcome this problem, an adaptive QSMO using an online parameter adaption scheme is proposed to estimate the extended EMF components in an IPMSM, which are then used to estimate the rotor position of the IPMSM. The resulting position estimation has zero phase lags and is highly robust to load variations. The proposed adaptive QSMO is implemented on a 150-kW IPMSM drive system used in heavy-duty, off-road, hybrid electric vehicles. Testing results for ramp torque changes, four-quadrant operations, and complete torque reversals between full motoring and full braking modes are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sensorless control algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Quasi-Sliding-Mode Rotor Position Observer-Based Sensorless Control for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2246871","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6525347/06461132.pdf","startPage":"5618","endPage":"5629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2246871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Quasi-Sliding-Mode Rotor Position Observer-Based Sensorless Control for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13539101","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Quasi-Sliding-Mode Rotor Position Observer-Based Sensorless Control for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","sourcePdf":"tpel-qiao-2246871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031928S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6525347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"114","articleId":"6461132","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461149,"authors":[{"name":"Ling-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6461149/6461149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ling-Yuan Hsu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since 2006, he has been with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University."]},"firstName":"Ling-Yuan","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37534575100"},{"name":"Tsung-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6461149/6461149-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Lin Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in power mechanical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1990 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2001.","From 2001 to 2002, he was a MEMS Design Engineer with Analog Devices Inc.

The constrained wheel torques can be achieved using the two-wheel drive and differential brakes. The proposed control algorithm is developed using the following steps. First, the sliding-mode control is used to find stability constraints for trajectory following when the vehicle system is subjected to modeling errors. Second, these stability constraints, along with other actuator constraints, are particularly tuned for the proposed control distribution method. The proposed control distribution method determines four longitudinal tire forces and minimizes actuator control efforts. Finally, these tire forces are converted to traction/braking wheel torques. The proposed method has the following advantages: 1) It achieves both robust trajectory following and optimal control efforts, 2) the optimal control effort is obtained analytically instead of from a numerical search, and 3) the robust performance of this vehicle control system can be theoretically verified. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical simulations on two front-drive vehicle models: a full-state vehicle model and a sedan model from the Carsim commercial software. The simulation results indicate that, in both cases, the proposed method can regulate the vehicle to finish a \u201cdouble-lane change\u201d when the vehicle is moving at an initial speed of 90 km/h.

However, when they are coupled with asynchronous interchannel spectrum sensing (moments), there are at least two drawbacks in these CS schemes, i.e., producing more interference to a primary user (PU) and fewer throughputs to a secondary user (SU). Therefore, to overcome these two drawbacks, we propose a proactive FH-DSA method against asynchronous interchannel spectrum sensing with reduced interference to the PU, while enhancing the SU throughput by eliminating the spectrum sensing time overhead during CS. The optimal FH policy is obtained by formulating proactive FH-DSA in the dynamic programming framework. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical average interference and the bound of average delay under the proposed FH-DSA. Based on them, while considering the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, and the practical requirements for interference and throughput, we propose one extension which proactively takes FH subject to an interference constraint to further reduce interference. The complexity of the proposed schemes is also analyzed. Finally, simulation results show the performance improvement of the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13843016","htmlLink":"/document/6461151/","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Frequency-Hopping Dynamic Spectrum Access Against Asynchronous Interchannel Spectrum Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Frequency-Hopping Dynamic Spectrum Access Against Asynchronous Interchannel Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-gu-2246595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098757S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6631523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6631523","articleId":"6461151","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6461152,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ismat Kadir","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6461152/6461152-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Ismat Kadir received the B.Sc.

The DN can jointly detect the signals received via the SN-to-DN and VAA-to-DN links using a low-complexity single-stream-based joint maximum-likelihood (ML) detector. We also propose a differentially encoded cooperative MC-CDMA STSK scheme to facilitate communications over hostile dispersive channels without requiring channel estimation (CE). Dispensing with CE is important since the relays cannot be expected to altruistically estimate the SN-to-RN links for simply supporting the source. Furthermore, we propose soft-decision-aided serially concatenated recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) and unity-rate-coded (URC) cooperative MC STSK and investigate its performance in both coherent and noncoherent scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2246800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2246800","startPage":"2544","endPage":"2557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6557008/06461152.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive-Relaying-Aided Decode-and-Forward Coherent Versus Noncoherent Cooperative Multicarrier Space\u2013Time Shift Keying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Successive-Relaying-Aided Decode-and-Forward Coherent Versus Noncoherent Cooperative Multicarrier Space\u2013Time Shift Keying","volume":"62","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655113","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461152/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive-Relaying-Aided Decode-and-Forward Coherent Versus Noncoherent Cooperative Multicarrier Space\u2013Time Shift Keying","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2246800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152115S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6557008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6557008","articleId":"6461152","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6461153,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6461153/6461153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Felix Hoffmann received the Diploma in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 2006.

We analyze the performance of both approaches by means of simulations and compare the solution that they provide to a simple hop-count-based routing and gateway selection solution.

Spectral amplitude encoding is applied on a broadband UV source using the same code families for the M-ary alphabet as used previously in SAC optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. A differential structure using two photomultiplier tubes is utilized in conjunction with various demodulation algorithms to decode the received signal. Intersymbol interference (ISI), received beam divergence and shot noise are considered as the main factors limiting the system performance. An upper bound on the bit error probability is presented and compared with simulation results for various geometries and for different code parameters. The maximum bit rate for a fixed bit error probability is calculated in terms of the link length, and results for different alphabet sizes are shown. By sacrificing spectral efficiency without becoming more susceptible to ISI, the proposed system can support higher rates and longer distances for the same performance compared with on-off keying systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NLOS UV Communications Using M-ary Spectral-Amplitude-Coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06461162.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"NLOS UV Communications Using M-ary Spectral-Amplitude-Coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6461162/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487685","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLOS UV Communications Using M-ary Spectral-Amplitude-Coding","sourcePdf":"1544-tc1304-noshad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084695S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6461162","onlineDate":"12 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6461165,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Zeinali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Integrated Circuits Design Laboratory, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6716075/6461165/6461165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behzad Zeinali received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.","He has been a Research Assistant with the IC Laboratory, Amirkabir University of Technology, since 2008, where he worked on the digital calibration of pipelined ADCs and design of CMOS tunable filters.

As LTE is expected to become the most widely deployed broadband communication technology, we examine the capability of LTE to meet these requirements, and identify possible future developments to LTE that could further enhance its ability to provide the necessary service.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6461169/06461193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461169","startPage":"106","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE for public safety networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LTE for public safety networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308891","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461193/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE for public safety networks","sourcePdf":"024TATESH.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055283S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6461169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"6461169","articleId":"6461193","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6461195,"authors":[{"name":"Hyojoon Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hyojoon Kim (joonk@gatech.edu) is with Georgia Institute of Technology."]},"firstName":"Hyojoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37538800200"},{"name":"Nick Feamster","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nick Feamster (feamster@cc.gatech.edu) is with Georgia Institute of Technology."]},"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Feamster","id":"37294542400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6461195","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":753,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":21456},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461195","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home automation","Telecommunication network management","Control systems","Ad hoc networks","Software radio","Authentication","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","high level languages","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network management","software defined networking","secure communication","low-level vendor-specific configuration","complex high-level network policy","stop-gap solution","SDN","packet forwarding device","logically centralized software program","high-level policy language"]}],"abstract":"Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6461169/06461195.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving network management with software defined networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improving network management with software defined networking","volume":"51","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461195/","publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308892","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving network management with software defined networking","sourcePdf":"026FEAMSTER.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054312S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6461169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"753","xplore-issue":"6461169","articleId":"6461195","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6461196,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Banikazemi","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Over a brief period, networking support offered by both cloud service providers and cloud controller platforms has developed rapidly. In most of these cloud networking service models, however, users must configure a variety of network-layer constructs such as switches, subnets, and ACLs, which can then be used by their cloud applications. In this article, we argue for a service-level network model that provides higher- level connectivity and policy abstractions that are integral parts of cloud applications. Moreover, the emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm provides a new opportunity to closely integrate application provisioning in the cloud with the network through programmable interfaces and automation. We describe the architecture and implementation of Meridian, an SDN controller platform that supports a service-level model for application networking in clouds. We discuss some of the key challenges in the design and implementation, including how to efficiently handle dynamic updates to virtual networks, orchestration of network tasks on a large set of devices, and how Meridian can be integrated with multiple cloud controllers.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461196","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6461169/06461196.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"120","endPage":"127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meridian: an SDN platform for cloud network services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Meridian: an SDN platform for cloud network services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461196/","volume":"51","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6461196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308893","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meridian: an SDN platform for cloud network services","sourcePdf":"027SHAIKH.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087654S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6461169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6461169","articleId":"6461196","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461197,"authors":[{"name":"Nate Foster","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nate Foster is an assistant professor at Cornell University."]},"firstName":"Nate","lastName":"Foster","id":"38548459900"},{"name":"Arjun Guha","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Arjun Guha is an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst."]},"firstName":"Arjun","lastName":"Guha","id":"38548628800"},{"name":"Mark Reitblatt","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mark Reitblatt is a Ph.D. student at Cornell University."]},"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Reitblatt","id":"37992122700"},{"name":"Alec Story","affiliation":["Cornell University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alec Story was an undergraduate student at Cornell University while working on this project."]},"firstName":"Alec","lastName":"Story","id":"37088612512"},{"name":"Michael J.

However, managing these networks is unnecessarily complicated and error-prone, due to a heterogeneous mix of devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, and middleboxes) with closed and proprietary configuration interfaces. Softwaredefined networks are poised to change this by offering a clean and open interface between networking devices and the software that controls them. In particular, many commercial switches support the OpenFlow protocol, and a number of campus, data center, and backbone networks have deployed the new technology. However, while SDNs make it possible to program the network, they does not make it easy. Today's OpenFlow controllers offer low-level APIs that mimic the underlying switch hardware. To reach SDNs full potential, we need to identify the right higher-level abstractions for creating (and composing) applications. In the Frenetic project, we are designing simple and intuitive abstractions for programming the three main stages of network management: monitoring network traffic, specifying and composing packet forwarding policies, and updating policies in a consistent way. Overall, these abstractions make it dramatically easier for programmers to write and reason about SDN applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6461169/06461197.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Languages for software-defined networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Monitoring","Ports (Computers)","IP networks","Repeaters","Control systems","Software radio","Languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","computer network management","high level languages","protocols","software radio","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software-defined networks","computer networks","access control","server load balancing","network traffic monitoring","network management","proprietary configuration interfaces","networking devices","OpenFlow protocol","data center","backbone networks","SDN","OpenFlow controllers","low-level API","switch hardware","higher-level abstractions","Frenetic project","intuitive abstractions","packet forwarding policies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Languages for software-defined networks","volume":"51","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6461197/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308894","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Languages for software-defined networks","sourcePdf":"028WALKER.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055612S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6461169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6461169","articleId":"6461197","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6461198,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Hassas Yeganeh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Soheil Hassas Yeganeh is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

This paper presents a method for automatic detection of neurological disordered voices like Parkinson's disease, cerebellar demyelination and stroke using the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features. The features extracted were given to a multilayer neural network and trained to classify whether the voice was neurological disordered or normal subject. There are no risks involved in capturing and analysis of voice signals as it is noninvasive by nature and in carefully controlled circumstances, it can provide a large amount of meaningful data. The data collected in the present work consist of 137 sustained vowel phonations (/ah/), among them 73 phonations are from patients suffering from different neurological diseases and 64 phonations from controlled subjects including both male and female subjects. Thirteen MFCC features are used as input to the optimally designed artificial neural network (ANN) for classification. 112 phonations were used to train the network and 25 phonations for testing.

Patients with lung cancer are often misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis leading to delay in the correct diagnosis as well as exposure to inappropriate medication. The diagnosis of tuberculosis and lung cancer is difficult, as symptoms of both diseases are similar. Due to high TB prevalence and radiological similarities, a large number of lung cancer patients initially get wrongly treated for tuberculosis based on radiological picture alone. However, treating TB leads to inflammatory fibrosis in some of the patients. In all these cases, the diagnosis is confirmed only with a biopsy which is an invasive technique that is usually performed via Bronchoscopy or CT - guided biopsy. There comes the need of an efficient Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) of the fibrosis and adenocarcinoma diseases. The increased chance of characterizing tissues with the help of CAD and the achievable workload reduction for the radiologist demand the usage of these systems in CT screenings as well as daily hospital practice. Generally, the CAD is designed based on the Region of Interest(ROI) given by the radiologist which makes the system semi-automatic. Our work presents a fully automated method of characterization of carcinoma from other lung abnormalities namely fibrosis and suspicious of tuberculosis. A comparison study is also done by evaluating the performance of Neural Network Classifier with three set of features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Point-of-Care Healthcare Technologies (PHT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449584/6461258/06461337.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Point-of-Care Healthcare Technologies (PHT)","doi":"10.1109/PHT.2013.6461337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHT.2013.6461337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of texture analysis in the differentiation of carcinoma from other lung abnormalities using Low-Dose CT images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Cancer","Computed tomography","Diseases","Training","Entropy","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","computerised tomography","image recognition","image texture","lung","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture analysis","carcinoma differentiation","lung abnormalities","Low Dose CT images","pulmonary tuberculosis","medication","CT guided biopsy","Computer Aided Diagnosis","adenocarcinoma diseases","Neural Network Classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Aided Diagnosis","Image Processing","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of texture analysis in the differentiation of carcinoma from other lung abnormalities using Low-Dose CT images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13325464","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of texture analysis in the differentiation of carcinoma from other lung abnormalities using Low-Dose CT images","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"0690080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09722S","chronDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6449584","isNumber":"6461258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449584","xplore-issue":"6461258","articleId":"6461337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6461351,"authors":[{"name":"Princy Matlani","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Raipur, India"],"firstName":"Princy","lastName":"Matlani","id":"38547343000"},{"name":"Narendra D Londhe","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Raipur, India"],"firstName":"Narendra D","lastName":"Londhe","id":"37945747800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2767-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2765-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2766-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5262"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5270"}],"articleNumber":"6461351","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Telemedicine","Cloud computing","Medical diagnostic imaging","Smart phones","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","telemedicine service","health","internet service","real time data accessibility","authentication","medical professionals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Healthcare","Telemedicine","Cloud Computing","Mobile devices"]}],"abstract":"\u201cHealth is the greatest possession\u201d.

He then describes the efforts of two electrical engineering institutes as they staked claims in computing, followed by a discussion of bifurcated versus integrated visions for the new field. In the final sections, the article turns to the emergence and establishment of computer engineering as a distinct field or specialty, primarily in the context of professional societies and private-sector firms.

It is found that the proposed methods, especially the beamspace-TR-MUSIC, achieve improved focusing ability even in the presence of dense fibroglandular tissue clutter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamspace Time-Reversal Microwave Imaging for Breast Cancer Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247018","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6478802/06461384.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","displayDocTitle":"Beamspace Time-Reversal Microwave Imaging for Breast Cancer Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6461384/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","publicationDate":"2013","accessionNumber":"13370208","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamspace Time-Reversal Microwave Imaging for Breast Cancer Detection","sourcePdf":"lawp-hossain-2247018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057609S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6478802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6478802","articleId":"6461384","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6461385,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratories of Avionics School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274217800"},{"name":"Junzhou Yu","affiliation":["Laboratories of Avionics School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junzhou","lastName":"Yu","id":"38238997100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6461385","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":697},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Channel model plays a very important role in the wireless communication systems for verification of the key technologies in the mobile communications, such as modulation, coding and antenna design, etc. Usually, the channel model can be achieved by experimental method, which needs a large amount of measured data. In order to save the cost, some electromagnetic methods have been proposed to simulate the channel model, such as ray tracing and finite-difference time domain (FDTD). These methods can provide a good approximation of the real channel. However, in the traditional way, the uniform sampling is adopted, and the amount of simulated data is quite large. It costs a great deal of calculation and memory resources, which results in a time-exhausted computation. In this letter, compressive sensing (CS) is employed to decrease the complexity in channel modeling with simulation by digital map. The sparsity of the receiving signal is revealed and highlighted, which leads to the fact that the signal can be measured randomly less than the traditional Nyquist sampling rate. The simulation confirms that the complexity can be reduced at least 90% with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6478802/06461385.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing Wireless Channel Modeling With Digital Map","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Channel models","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","finite difference time-domain analysis","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["root mean square error","traditional Nyquist sampling rate","time-exhausted computation","memory resources","finite-difference time domain","ray tracing","electromagnetic methods","mobile communications","verification","digital map","wireless channel modeling","compressive sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel model","compressive sensing","ray tracing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing Wireless Channel Modeling With Digital Map","volume":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6461385/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2013","accessionNumber":"13387285","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing Wireless Channel Modeling With Digital Map","sourcePdf":"lawp-zhang-2247019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123212S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6478802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6478802","articleId":"6461385","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6461394,"authors":[{"name":"Lee-Min Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Dayeh University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lee-Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086110830"},{"name":"Fu-Rong Jean","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Rong","lastName":"Jean","id":"37347389200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2275"}],"articleNumber":"6461394","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Speech","Feature extraction","Data models","Adaptation models","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model adaptation","distributed speech recognition applications","reduced-frame-rate data","observation sequence frame rate","resource-limited front-end device","full-frame-rate data","transition probabilities","HMM","clean connected digit recognition","noisy connected digit recognition","training data","test data","RFR speech data recognition","data interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptation","distributed speech recognition (DSR)","hidden Markov model (HMM)","reduced frame rate (RFR)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Humans","Information Storage and Retrieval","Markov Chains","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Speech Production Measurement","Speech Recognition Software"]}],"abstract":"The frame rate of the observation sequence in distributed speech recognition applications may be reduced to suit a resource-limited front-end device. In order to use models trained using full-frame-rate data in the recognition of reduced-frame-rate (RFR) data, we propose a method for adapting the transition probabilities of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to match the frame rate of the observation. Experiments on the recognition of clean and noisy connected digits are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively compensate for the frame-rate mismatch between the training and the test data.

However, because neural networks with manually designed features are commonly used to deal with continuous state and action spaces, the generalization capability and learning efficiency of previous ACDs still need to be improved. In this paper, a novel framework of ACDs with sparse kernel machines is presented by integrating kernel methods into the critic of ACDs. To improve the generalization capability as well as the computational efficiency of kernel machines, a sparsification method based on the approximately linear dependence analysis is used. Using the sparse kernel machines, two kernel-based ACD algorithms, that is, kernel HDP (KHDP) and kernel DHP (KDHP), are proposed and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the representation learning and generalization capability of sparse kernel machines, KHDP and KDHP can obtain much better performance than previous HDP and DHP with manually designed neural networks. Simulation and experimental results of two nonlinear control problems, that is, a continuous-action inverted pendulum problem and a ball and plate control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel ACD methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2236354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2236354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6477170/06461419.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Learning Control Using Adaptive Critic Designs With Sparse Kernel Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Online Learning Control Using Adaptive Critic Designs With Sparse Kernel Machines","volume":"24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13382492","pubMedId":"24808426","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461419/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Learning Control Using Adaptive Critic Designs With Sparse Kernel Machines","sourcePdf":"tnnls-xu-2236354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139194S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6477170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6477170","articleId":"6461419","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461425,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Eryigit","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Eryigit","id":"38467232900"},{"name":"Suzan Bayhan","affiliation":["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Suzan","lastName":"Bayhan","id":"37547369000"},{"name":"Tuna Tugcu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tuna","lastName":"Tugcu","id":"37265722800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6461425","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Energy consumption","Sun","Cascading style sheets","Optimization","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","optimisation","radio networks","radio spectrum management","scheduling","signal detection","signal sampling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient multichannel cooperative sensing scheduling","heterogeneous channel conditions","cognitive radio networks","CRN","secondary users","SU","primary-user protection","PU","EE spectrum sensing scheduling","received signal-to-noise ratio","optimization problem","energy consumption","spectrum sensing duration minimization","data transmission","outer linearization method","heuristic methods","average channel SNR","channel sampling frequency","transmission-time maximization technique","TXT technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative sensing scheduling (CSS)","energy-efficient (EE) sensing","heterogeneous sensing","sensing task assignment"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is an important aspect of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Secondary users (SUs) should periodically sense the channels to ensure primary-user (PU) protection. Sensing with cooperation among several SUs is more robust and less error prone. However, cooperation also increases the energy spent for sensing. Considering the periodic nature of sensing, even a small amount of savings in each sensing period leads to considerable improvement in the long run. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy-efficient (EE) spectrum sensing scheduling with satisfactory PU protection. Our model exploits the diversity of SUs in their received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the primary signal to determine the sensing duration for each user/channel pair for higher energy efficiency. We model the given problem as an optimization problem with two different objectives. The first objective is to minimize the energy consumption, and the second objective is to minimize the spectrum sensing duration to maximize the remaining time for data transmission. We solve both problems using the outer linearization method. In addition, we present two suboptimal but efficient heuristic methods. We provide an extensive performance analysis of our proposed methods under various numbers of SUs, average channel SNR, and channel sampling frequency. Our analysis reveals that all proposals with an energy minimization perspective provide significant energy savings compared with a pure transmission-time maximization (TXT) technique.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2247070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6557008/06461425.pdf","startPage":"2690","endPage":"2699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2247070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel Cooperative Sensing Scheduling With Heterogeneous Channel Conditions for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461425/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel Cooperative Sensing Scheduling With Heterogeneous Channel Conditions for Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655116","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel Cooperative Sensing Scheduling With Heterogeneous Channel Conditions for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-eryigit-2247070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089696S","chronDate":"July  2013","isNumber":"6557008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","articleId":"6461425","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6461426,"authors":[{"name":"Wenling Li","affiliation":["Seventh Research Division, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenling","lastName":"Li","id":"37597598000"},{"name":"Yingmin Jia","affiliation":["Seventh Research Division, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingmin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37331968800"},{"name":"Junping Du","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junping","lastName":"Du","id":"37394941900"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086632594"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6461426","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1016},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper studies the problem of simultaneous localization and tracking (SLAT) in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. By combining a target state and a sensor node location into an augmented vector, a nonlinear system with two jumping parameters is formulated in which two independent Markov chains are used to describe the switching of the target maneuvers and the transition of LOS/NLOS, respectively. To derive the state estimate of the proposed jump Markov nonlinear system for each sensor node, an interacting multiple-model (IMM) approach and a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) are employed. As the number of mode-conditioned filters exponentially grows with the increases in the number of active sensor nodes in the centralized fusion, a distributed scheme is adopted to reduce the computational burden, and a covariance intersection (CI) method is used to fuse sensor-based target-state estimates. A numerical example is provided, involving tracking a maneuvering target by a set of sensors, and simulation results show that the proposed filter can track the target and can estimate the positions of active sensor nodes accurately.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

multi-antenna systems. The TTD circuit employs a distributed active switching structure in which eight cascode switches are distributed along transmission lines, leading to 3-bit variations of the group delay. The size of the switches and the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines are carefully scaled so as to minimize loss variation among the different delay states, while maintaining flat delay performance over a wide bandwidth. The circuit is implemented in a bulk 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology and exhibits a total variable group delay of 40 ps with an average resolution of 5 ps from 15 to 40 GHz. The insertion loss was 14 dB with a maximum RMS variation of 1.6 dB, while the input and output return loss was better than 10 dB over the operating bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2013.2244872","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6475281/06461436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6475281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2013.2244872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","startPage":"149","endPage":"151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 15\u201340 GHz CMOS True-Time Delay Circuit for UWB Multi-Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 15\u201340 GHz CMOS True-Time Delay Circuit for UWB Multi-Antenna Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461436/","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6461436/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355481","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 15\u201340 GHz CMOS True-Time Delay Circuit for UWB Multi-Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"lmwc-jeon-2244872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087386S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"6475281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6475281","articleId":"6461436","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461444,"authors":[{"name":"Horng-Yuan Shih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Horng-Yuan","lastName":"Shih","id":"37267892500"},{"name":"Chun-Fan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Fan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38562937400"},{"name":"Sheng-Kai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Kai","lastName":"Lin","id":"38560962800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6461444","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":834},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A low power, wideband and high linearity current-mode based differential baseband amplifier with a bandwidth from dc to 600 MHz applied for 60 GHz zero-IF RF receiver is presented.

After installing three coupled-line sections at one input port and two output ports along the ring, additional two in-band poles and one upper-stopband transmission zero are further introduced. Subsequently, total five transmission zeros are utilized to improve the passband selectivity and suppress the high-order harmonic.

The consequence is that there are so many services that share the same or similar functions. Therefore, it is important to select a credible and optimal service. Reputation as one of the important parameters of services plays a significant role in the decision support for service selection. This paper proposes a novel two-phase method to calculate service reputation. The first phase uses a dynamic weight formula to calculate reputation such that it can reflect the latest tendency of a service. The second one uses an olfactory response formula to mitigate the negative effect of unfair ratings. Some experiments are conducted and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6549150/06461455.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2013.2238231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2013.2238231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Calculating Service Reputation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Olfactory","Fatigue","Web services","Quality of service","Fading","Hidden Markov models","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision support systems","electronic commerce","particle swarm optimisation","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service reputation calculation","optimal service selection","credible service selection","decision support","two-phase method","dynamic weight formula","olfactory response formula","unfair rating negative effect mitigation","electronic commerce","Web service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Business","electronic commerce","olfactory response","particle swarm optimization","performance evaluation","service reputation","web service","workflow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Calculating Service Reputation","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6461455/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13599289","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Calculating Service Reputation","sourcePdf":"tase-zhou-2238231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099182S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6549150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6549150","articleId":"6461455","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461472,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Z.

An intrinsic mathematical relationship is found to support this new classification. It is believed that this triangle is concise, mathematically sound and aesthetically beautiful, compared with Chua's quadrangle. The importance of finding a correct circuit element table is similar to that of Mendeleev's periodic table of chemical elements in chemistry and the table of 61 elementary particles in physics, in terms of categorizing the existing elements and predicting new elements. A correct circuit element table would also request to rewrite the 20th century textbooks.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2209734","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6468162/06461472.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"623","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2209734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Triangular Periodic Table of Elementary Circuit Elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Triangular Periodic Table of Elementary Circuit Elements","volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13325875","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461472/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Triangular Periodic Table of Elementary Circuit Elements","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-2209734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059352S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6468162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6468162","articleId":"6461472","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6461483,"authors":[{"name":"Steven M.

Particularly, in event-driven M2M communications, a large number of devices become activated within a short period of time, which in turn causes high radio congestions and severe access delay. To address this issue, we propose a Fast Adaptive S-ALOHA (FASA) scheme for random access control of M2M communication systems with bursty traffic. Instead of the observation in a single slot, the statistics of consecutive idle and collision slots are used in FASA to accelerate the tracking process of network status that is critical for optimizing S-ALOHA systems. With a design based on drift analysis, the estimate of the number of the active devices under FASA converges fast to the true value. Furthermore, by examining the T-slot drifts, we prove that the proposed FASA scheme is stable as long as the average arrival rate is smaller than e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n, in the sense that the Markov chain derived from the scheme is geometrically ergodic. Simulation results demonstrate that under highly bursty traffic, the proposed FASA scheme outperforms traditional additive schemes such as PB-ALOHA and achieves near-optimal performance in reducing access delays. Moreover, compared to multiplicative schemes, FASA shows its robustness under heavy traffic load in addition to better delay performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","volume":"21","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13989921","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461488/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FASA: Accelerated S-ALOHA Using Access History for Event-Driven M2M Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FASA: Accelerated S-ALOHA Using Access History for Event-Driven M2M Communications","sourcePdf":"tnet-wu-2241076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6685909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6685909","articleId":"6461488","onlineDate":"13 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6461492,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Frederico M.

In this paper, we study a problem of scheduling EV charging with ES from an electricity market perspective with joint consideration for the aggregator energy trading in the day-ahead and real-time markets. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to provide optimal solutions as well as a simple polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on LP rounding. In addition, we present a communication protocol for interactions among the aggregator, the ES, the power grid, and EVs, and demonstrate how to integrate the proposed scheduling approach in real-time charging operations.

As a major initiative, many countries including the United Kingdom, United States, and China have already started deploying smart grids. One of the biggest advantages of smart grids compared to traditional energy grids is the ability to remotely read fine-granular measurements from each smart meter, which enables the grid operators to balance load efficiently and offer adapted time-dependent tariffs. However, collecting fine-granular data also poses a serious privacy threat for the citizens as illustrated by the decision of the Dutch Parliament in 2009 that rejects the deployment of smart meters due to privacy considerations. Hence, it is a must to enforce privacy rights without disrupting the smart grid services like billing and data aggregation. Secure signal processing (SSP) aims at protecting the sensitive data by means of encryption and provides tools to process them under encryption, effectively addressing the smart metering privacy problem.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6461589/06461626.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"86","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2228343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2228343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving data aggregation in smart metering systems: an overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving data aggregation in smart metering systems: an overview","htmlLink":"/document/6461626/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308930","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving data aggregation in smart metering systems: an overview","sourcePdf":"30msp02-erkin-2228343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055122S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6461589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6461589","articleId":"6461626","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6461657,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The results confirm that the Class D amplifier is a worthy replacement for the existing, market available Class A amplifier, which is running at 19% efficiency and weighs 480 g with a PCB area of 160 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461657","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6428838/6461638/06461657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class D RF amplifier for 20 MHz NMR MOUSE sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Class D RF amplifier for 20 MHz NMR MOUSE sensor","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461657/","accessionNumber":"13309923","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461657/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class D RF amplifier for 20 MHz NMR MOUSE sensor","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"p13dykstra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041016S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6428838","isNumber":"6461638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6428838","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6461638","articleId":"6461657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6461672,"authors":[{"name":"Aroma Mahendru","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi, India"],"firstName":"Aroma","lastName":"Mahendru","id":"38548537000"},{"name":"Mukul Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mukul","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37394227700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2248-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2246-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2245-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8073"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8065"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8065"}],"articleNumber":"6461672","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"Polarization is an inherent property of light. The phenomenon of polarization by reflection of light from a transparent object differs from an opaque object. The specular reflection from the transparent object is highly polarized compared to the diffuse reflection from the opaque object. The differences in the polarization pattern can be recorded and can be used in machine vision applications like object classification and autonomous agent navigation. In this paper we present different methodologies like degree of polarization, polarization Fresnel ratio, Stokes degree of polarization to classify among transparent and opaque objects. Based on the polarization profile, the shapes of the transparent objects are also estimated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6428838/6461638/06461672.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","doi":"10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired object classification using polarization imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Cameras","Materials","Stokes parameters","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification","light polarisation","light reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Stokes degree of polarization","polarization Fresnel ratio","autonomous agent navigation","machine vision application","specular light reflection","opaque object","transparent object","polarization imaging","bioinspired object classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarization imaging","transparent and opaque objects detection","machine vision","object classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired object classification using polarization imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461672/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325529","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired object classification using polarization imaging","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"p207mahendru.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044615S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6428838","isNumber":"6461638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6428838","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6461638","articleId":"6461672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461681,"authors":[{"name":"S.

IoT coverage is very wide and include variety of objects like smart phones, tablets, digital cameras, sensors, etc. Once all these devices are connected with each other, they enable more and more smart processes and services that support our basic needs, economies, environment and health. Such enormous number of devices connected to internet provides many kinds of services and produce huge amount of data and information. Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. compute, networks, servers, storage, applications, services, and software) that can be easily provisioned as Infrastructure (IaaS), software and applications (SaaS). Cloud based platforms help to connect to the things (IaaS) around us so that we can access anything at any time and any place in a user friendly manner using customized portals and in built applications (SaaS). Hence, cloud acts as a front end to access Internet of Things. Applications that interact with devices like sensors have special requirements of massive storage to storage big data, huge computation power to enable the real time processing of the data, and high speed network to stream audio or video. In this paper, we describe how Internet of Things and Cloud computing can work together can address the Big Data issues. We also illustrate about Sensing as a service on cloud using few applications like Augmented Reality, Agriculture and Environment monitoring. Finally, we also propose a prototype model for providing sensing as a service on cloud.","doi":"10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461705","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6428838/6461638/06461705.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing for Internet of Things & sensing based applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing for Internet of Things & sensing based applications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461705/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325541","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing for Internet of Things & sensing based applications","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"p374raobb.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058798S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6428838","isNumber":"6461638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6428838","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"6461638","articleId":"6461705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461729,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is very difficult the identification of seizures because they are infrequent events to be detected and an electroencephalogram (EEG) does not always show abnormalities due to interferences and noise. In this work, methods based on principles of spatial filtering are developed to allow a more accurate diagnosis. For this aim techniques based on Beamforming are taken into account for their ability to constrain the passing of the electrical activity from a specified location attenuating the activity to others. The problem is set as a waveform estimation, so information about amplitude and frequency of the signal are extracted from measured EEG signal. The reconstruction of the desired signal, that is the possible signal originated from epileptogenic focus, will highlight abnormalities or not in the electrical activity of the brain, and will help to have accurate diagnosis. For this scope, in this work, EEG data by scalp are simulated, in a preliminary way, through the solution of a forward problem related to geometry of the head and to the definition of a model for the envisaged source. A simple geometry is considered and, simulations and results are presented, showing the performance of several algorithms. Following the methods have been applied on real data, In this case it is necessary to know the position of the source for to reconstructing of the signal of interest. As per alternative, to estimate the position of the sources, methods of a DOA estimation have been studied. In a preliminary way this problem is faced with consideration on the resolution issue of the sources when they are very close together.","doi":"10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461729","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6428838/6461638/06461729.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSensT.2012.6461729","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","startPage":"497","endPage":"501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing EEG signals through beamforming techniques for seizure diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Processing EEG signals through beamforming techniques for seizure diagnosis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461729/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461729/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325558","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing EEG signals through beamforming techniques for seizure diagnosis","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"p497vergallo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069799S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6428838","isNumber":"6461638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6428838","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6461638","articleId":"6461729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6461768,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshman Pappula","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Lakshman","lastName":"Pappula","id":"38547537900"},{"name":"Debalina Ghosh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Debalina","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37671819400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2248-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2246-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2245-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8073"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8065"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8065"}],"articleNumber":"6461768","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of real coded genetic algorithm for target sensing","abstract":"Complex matrix equations need to be solved for extracting the impulse response of the target.

Exploiting the advantages and principles of the cloud, such as the pay as you go business model and geographical dispersion of resources, CCDN can provide a viable and cost-effective solution for realizing content delivery networks and services. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is proposed and evaluated toward an efficient and scalable solution of content distribution over a multiprovider networked cloud environment, where inter and intra cloud communication resources are simultaneously considered along with traditional cloud computing resources. To efficiently deal with the CCDN deployment problem in this emerging and challenging computing paradigm, the problem is decomposed to graph partitioning and replica placement problems while appropriate cost models are introduced/adapted. Novel approaches on the replica placement problem within the cloud are proposed while the limitations of the physical substrate are taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed hierarchical CCDN framework is assessed via modeling and simulation, while appropriate metrics are defined/adopted associated with and reflecting the interests of the different identified involved key players.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2013.12","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The main challenge of this attack proved to be the lack of sufficient information in the public domain about the bitstream format and the internal architecture and configurability of the FPGA. Nevertheless, we were able to show that under certain constraints on the functionality, size and placement of the Trojan on the FPGA, it is possible to modify the configuration bitstream by a software program to insert a hardware Trojan in the design. The main strength of the attack lies in the fact that since the modification is at the configuration bitstream level, it bypasses all predeployment design validation mechanisms. We also propose some techniques to prevent the demonstrated attack. We hope that this work will raise awareness among FPGA users about the potency of the threat posed by this relatively simple attack and its improved variants. .","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2013.2247460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221038/6523949/06461919.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6523949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2013.2247460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojan Insertion by Direct Modification of FPGA Configuration Bitstream","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Trojan Insertion by Direct Modification of FPGA Configuration Bitstream","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461919/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13539187","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6461919/","volume":"30","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Trojan Insertion by Direct Modification of FPGA Configuration Bitstream","sourcePdf":"mdat-chakraborty-2247460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046735S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221038","isNumber":"6523949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221038","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6523949","articleId":"6461919","onlineDate":"14 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6461923,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Nauta","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6521402/6461923/6461923-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcel Nauta (S'11\u2013M'12) received the B.Sc. degree in physics in 2010 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2012 from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","His research interests include FDTD methods for computational electromagnetics."]},"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Nauta","id":"38490191900"},{"name":"Michal Okoniewski","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6521402/6461923/6461923-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Michal Okoniewski (S'88\u2013M'89\u2013SM'97\u2013F'09) received the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Technical University Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland, in 1984 and 1991, respectively.","He is a Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department with the Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

Performance in common positioning stage designs is limited by the presence of lightly damped resonances and actuator nonlinearities such as hysteresis and creep. To improve the tracking performance in such systems, several damping and tracking control schemes have been presented in the literature. In this paper, six different control schemes are presented and applied to a nanopositioning system for experimental comparison. They include schemes applying damping control in the form of positive position feedback, integral resonant control, integral force feedback, and passive shunt-damping. Also, general pole placement in the form of model reference control, as well as a control scheme requiring only a combination of a low-pass filter and an integrator, is presented. The control schemes are fixed-structure, low-order control laws, for which few results exist in the literature with regard to optimal tuning. A practical tuning procedure for obtaining good tracking performance for five of the control schemes is, therefore, presented. Experimental results show that the schemes provide similar performance, and the main differences are due to the specific implementation of each scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6461946/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14115540","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Damping and Tracking Control Schemes for Nanopositioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping and Tracking Control Schemes for Nanopositioning","sourcePdf":"tmech-eielsen-2242482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093527S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6746080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6746080","articleId":"6461946","onlineDate":"14 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6461988,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","id":"37393409900"},{"name":"Salvatore Pontarelli","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Pontarelli","id":"37273892100"},{"name":"Juan Antonio Maestro","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Antonio","lastName":"Maestro","id":"37410622900"},{"name":"Marco Ottavi","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Ottavi","id":"37273889400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"6461988","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":740},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Delay","Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Registers","Encoding","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error correction codes","logic design","semiconductor storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low delay single error correction code","data bits protection","delay reductions","encoder","decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double error detection","error correction codes (ECCs)","single error correction (SEC)","soft errors"]}],"abstract":"Error correction codes (ECCs) have been used for decades to protect memories from soft errors. Single error correction (SEC) codes that can correct 1-bit error per word are a common option for memory protection. In some cases, SEC codes are extended to also provide double error detection and are known as SEC-DED codes. As technology scales, soft errors on registers also became a concern and, therefore, SEC codes are used to protect registers. The use of an ECC impacts the circuit design in terms of both delay and area. Traditional SEC or SEC-DED codes developed for memories have focused on minimizing the number of redundant bits added by the code. This is important in a memory as those bits are added to each word in the memory. However, for registers used in circuits, minimizing the delay or area introduced by the ECC can be more important. In this paper, a method to construct low delay SEC or SEC-DED codes that correct errors only on the data bits is proposed. The method is evaluated for several data block sizes, showing that the new codes offer significant delay reductions when compared with traditional SEC or SEC-DED codes. The results for the area of the encoder and decoder also show substantial savings compared to existing codes.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6461966/06461988.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method to Construct Low Delay Single Error Correction Codes for Protecting Data Bits Only","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2012.2226585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2012.2226585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6461988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Method to Construct Low Delay Single Error Correction Codes for Protecting Data Bits Only","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6461988/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method to Construct Low Delay Single Error Correction Codes for Protecting Data Bits Only","sourcePdf":"tcad-reviriego-2226585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047688S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6461966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6461966","articleId":"6461988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6461990,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjian Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6461966/6461990/6461990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenjian Yu (S'01\u2013M'04\u2013SM'10) received the B.S.and Ph.

An approach, including the numerical characterization of the cross-interface transition probability and weight value, is proposed to accelerate the extraction of structures with multiple dielectric layers. A comprehensive variance reduction scheme based on the importance sampling and stratified sampling is proposed to improve the convergence rate of the FRW algorithm. Finally, the space management technique using an octree data structure and the parallel computing technique are presented to further improve the efficiency. Numerical experiments are carried out with the test cases generated under the 180 and 45-nm process technologies. They demonstrate that the proposed multidielectric FRW algorithm achieves up to 160\u00d7 speedup over the FRW algorithm using spherical transition domains to cross dielectric interface, with very small memory overhead.

The RWCap also outperforms other existing FRW algorithm and fast boundary element method solvers in terms of computational time or scalability.

The addition of bidirectional communication to today's power grid can provide real-time pricing (RTP) to customers via smart meters. A growing number of appliance companies have started to design and produce smart appliances which embed intelligent control modules to implement residential demand response based on RTP. However, most of the current residential load scheduling schemes are centralized and based on either day-ahead pricing (DAP) or predicted price, which can deviate significantly from the RTP. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule as a real-time distributed scheduling algorithm for smart appliances' automation control. It determines the best time for appliances' operation to balance electricity bill reduction and inconvenience resulting from the operation delay. It is shown that our scheme is a distributed threshold policy when no constraint is considered. When a total power constraint exists, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be implemented in either a centralized or distributed fashion. Our scheme has low complexity and can be easily implemented. Simulation results validate proposed scheduling scheme shifts the operation to off-peak times and consequently leads to significant electricity bill saving with reasonable waiting time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6462005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","volume":"4","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13355391","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6462005/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Opportunistic Scheduling for Residential Demand Response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Opportunistic Scheduling for Residential Demand Response","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhou-2225155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081818S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6462005","onlineDate":"14 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6462007,"authors":[{"name":"Bassam Khamaisi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6471816/6462007/6462007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bassam Khamaisi has received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

It is widely recognized that separately detecting the amplitude and the phase of a received DAPSK symbol exhibits lower complexity than jointly detecting the two terms. However, since the amplitude and the phase of a DAPSK symbol are affected by correlated magnitude fading and phase rotations, detecting the two terms completely independently results in a performance loss, which is particularly significant for soft-decision-aided DAPSK detectors relying on multiple receive antennas. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose a new soft-decision-aided DAPSK detection method, which achieves optimum DAPSK detection capability at substantially reduced detection complexity. More specifically, we link each a priori soft-input bit to a specific part of the channel's output, so that only a reduced subset of the DAPSK constellation points has to be evaluated by the soft DAPSK detector. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed soft DAPSK detector exhibits lower detection complexity than that of independently detecting the amplitude and the phase, whereas the optimal performance of DAPSK detection is retained.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2247430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557008","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2643","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6557008/06462008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2247430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Noncoherent Soft-Decision-Aided DAPSK Dispensing With Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","Measurement","Receiving antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Demodulation","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","channel estimation","differential phase shift keying","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity noncoherent soft-decision-aided DAPSK dispensing","channel estimation","differential amplitude phase-shift keying","star-shaped quadrature-amplitude modulation","signal detection complexity","received DAPSK symbol","correlated magnitude fading","phase rotations","soft-decision-aided DAPSK detection method","optimum DAPSK detection capability","a priori soft-input bit","DAPSK constellation points"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential amplitude phase-shift keying (DAPSK)","iterative demapping and decoding","Log-MAP","Max-Log-MAP","reduced complexity","soft-decision-aided detection","star quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Noncoherent Soft-Decision-Aided DAPSK Dispensing With Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6462008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6462008/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13655118","publicationDate":"July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Noncoherent Soft-Decision-Aided DAPSK Dispensing With Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2247430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078123S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6557008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6557008","articleId":"6462008","onlineDate":"14 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6462023,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["University of Macau, Faculty of Science and Technology, Macao, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yan Zhu (S'10\u2013M'12) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and automation from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Macau Macao, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Macao, China.

Federations of remote laboratories have existed for years: they are based on enabling two universities to exchange remote laboratories directly, without registering students of the latter on the former university. Integration of remote laboratories on Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Content Management Systems (CMS) have also been addressed in the past, enabling institutions to delegate the authentication or authorization of the experiments to the LMS/CMS. However, these integrations are usually achieved in an ad hoc way, integrating each particular laboratory to a LMS/CMS. This contribution studies the use of federation models to integrate remote laboratory management systems in LMS/CMSs, since both approaches (integrating a laboratory on an a external electronic learning tool, and integrating a laboratory on other laboratory) are essentially equivalent. The contribution defines two case studies to evaluate this approach, showing how this integration is achieved on a LMS (Moodle) and on a CMS (Joomla).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote laboratories","Educational institutions","Least squares approximation","Protocols","Authentication","Authorization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","educational institutions","laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["e-learning tool","electronic learning","educational remote laboratory","remote laboratory integration","remote laboratory federation protocol","university","hands-on-lab session","learning management systems","LMS","content management system","CMS","authentication","authorization","LMS-CMS","Moodle","Joomla"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FIE.2012.6462220","publicationTitle":"2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6454261/6462204/06462220.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling remote laboratories integrations in e-learning tools through remote laboratories federation protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6462220","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modelling remote laboratories integrations in e-learning tools through remote laboratories federation protocols","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6462220/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6462220/","accessionNumber":"13326493","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling remote laboratories integrations in e-learning tools through remote laboratories federation protocols","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1569554619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043866S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6454261","isNumber":"6462204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454261","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6462204","articleId":"6462220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6462456,"authors":[{"name":"Cecilia Avila","affiliation":["Institut de Institut D'inform\u00e0tica i Aplicacions, Universitat de Girona, Girona, Spain"],"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Avila","id":"38232494900"},{"name":"Silvia Baldiris","affiliation":["Institut de Institut D'inform\u00e0tica i Aplicacions, Universitat de Girona, Girona, Spain"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Baldiris","id":"37662229300"},{"name":"Ramon Fabregat","affiliation":["Institut de Institut D'inform\u00e0tica i Aplicacions, Universitat de Girona, Girona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Fabregat","id":"37283191000"},{"name":"Juan Carlos Guevara","affiliation":["Facultad Tecnol\u00f3gica, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Juan Carlos","lastName":"Guevara","id":"37987633400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1352-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1353-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1351-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-634X"}],"articleNumber":"6462456","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Guidelines","Manuals","Libraries","Cognition","Context","HTML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","computer aided instruction","handicapped aids","information retrieval","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accessibility evaluation improvement","case based reasoning","learning objects","Web content accessibility guidelines","WCAG","TinyMCE Web content editor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Content Accessibility","Manual Evaluation","Automatic Evaluation","WCAG 2.0","Case Based Reasoning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6462456","abstract":"Nowadays, many web content editors allow teachers to create web content as learning objects; however, most of these editors do not generate accessible web content.

With only prescriptive templates to describe complex scenarios, common errors like misinterpretation and oversight can have costly consequence later during system development. A semi-automatic approach based on NL processing can reduce the time spent on requirement analysis and bootstrap design activity. However, linguistic community has adopted pipeline processing to handle NL ambiguities where several sequential tasks aid in solving a bigger task. Choosing NL processing techniques depends on the domain and task to accomplish. As use-cases are domain specific it is crucial to identify suitable pipelines to process them. This is highlighted in our evaluation of two pipelines consisting of syntactic and semantic techniques on use-cases found in theory and practice.

Our case study illustrates how a cognitive model can be used in an evaluation to elicit requirements for issues with cognitive complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2012.129","publicationTitle":"2012 19th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6462021/6462577/06462684.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"385","doi":"10.1109/APSEC.2012.129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Prototype Evaluation to Elicit Requirements for a Sensemaking Support Tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Prototype Evaluation to Elicit Requirements for a Sensemaking Support Tool","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6462684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13326371","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6462684/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Prototype Evaluation to Elicit Requirements for a Sensemaking Support Tool","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4922a380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095742S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6462021","isNumber":"6462577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6462021","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6462577","articleId":"6462684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6462845,"authors":[{"name":"Atefeh Salimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Atefeh","lastName":"Salimi","id":"38241351000"},{"name":"Rasoul Dehghani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Rasoul","lastName":"Dehghani","id":"37283401700"},{"name":"Abdolreza Nabavi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolreza","lastName":"Nabavi","id":"37265082400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2489-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2488-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2487-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6462845","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6462845","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Impedance","Power amplifiers","Modulation","Computer architecture","CMOS integrated circuits","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","modulators","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rail-to-rail class AB power amplifier","low output impedance class AB power amplifier","envelope tracking","polar modulator","polar power amplifier","polar modulation","RF power amplifier efficiency enhancement technique","hybrid switching envelope modulator","linear architecture","envelope modulator architecture","HSEM design","OFDM signal","CMOS technology","frequency 10 MHz","frequency 704 MHz","frequency 20 MHz","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class AB","rail-to-rail","cascode compensation","hybrid switching envelope modulator","CMOS"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of a class-AB power amplifier suitable for envelope modulator of polar power amplifiers.

Folding in retiming can also reduce the resource utilization and power consumption. This transformation requires computation of critical path and shortest path at various stages. In this particular work, a FPGA based path finder is designed to compute critical path and shortest path in the Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). Since this path computation is performed using FPGA based IC, the speed of retiming transformation increases. This also reduces the resource utilization of the general purpose machine in which retiming transformation is usually performed. Critical path in sequential circuit is defined as the longest path between any two storage components. This determines the minimum feasible clock period for any sequential circuit. We need to compute the critical path before we apply retiming transformation to any digital Signal Processing block. Similarly shortest path computation is required in retiming while solving the system inequalities in the constraint graph. In this work, shortest path computation is performed using Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Since FPGA based hardware for path solvers performs much faster when compared to general purpose processor [where actual retiming is done], the speed with which the retiming transformation is performed increases.

Compared to the other, previously published works, the paper presents simulations based on very complex link model containing all important parts of an optical wireless communication system. The link model allows setting of the basic parameters of laser diode, transmitting lens, laser beam, receiver lens, and parameters of photodiode and front-end amplifier of an optical receiver and also allows selection of the modulation format and many other electrical parameters. For modeling the turbulence effect on the link performance the modified Rytov scintillation theory have been used. The paper extends already published analysis of scintillation loss performed for a plane wave to a spherical wave which includes, in addition, the propagation loss. Communication link performances are calculated not only in dependence on general quantities such as scintillation index or signal to noise ratio, but they are evaluated for real link model parameters such as transmission range or power link margin.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications (ACTEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6454263/6462724/06462896.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"341","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications (ACTEA)","doi":"10.1109/ICTEA.2012.6462896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEA.2012.6462896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6462896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of free space optical communication performance caused by atmospheric turbulence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical losses","Error probability","Adaptive optics","Laser beams","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","lenses","optical links","optical losses","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical transmitters","photodiodes","semiconductor lasers","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optical communication performance degradation","atmospheric turbulence","optical power loss","transmission channel","laser diode","transmitting lens","laser beam","receiver lens","photodiode","front-end amplifier","optical receiver","modulation format","modified Rytov scintillation theory","scintillation index","signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FSO","power link margin","scintillation modeling","propagation loss","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6462896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of free space optical communication performance caused by atmospheric turbulence","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6462896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370971","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of free space optical communication performance caused by atmospheric turbulence","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"p338prokes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045346S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6454263","isNumber":"6462724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454263","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6462724","articleId":"6462896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6462966,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Sung Choi","affiliation":["DGIST, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Sung Choi","id":"38240031500"},{"name":"Byung Rak Son","affiliation":["DGIST, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung Rak Son","id":"38548608500"},{"name":"Hee Kuk Kang","affiliation":["DGIST, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hee Kuk Kang","id":"38468692000"},{"name":"Dong Ha Lee","affiliation":["DGIST, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Ha Lee","id":"37716469500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3112-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3111-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3109-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3110-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6462966","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":707},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization technique of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using passive UHF far-field RFID systems.

Some methods are not suitable for specific fields, so combing different extraction methods becomes a reasonable solution. We propose an algorithm to combine different extraction methods based on decision level fusion.

Randomness was introduced to the location updating formula of the particle, and the new definition of location update formula was given. We have, in the form of theorem, also proved that before PSO finds the optimal value, the position of the particle keeps changing continuously, the flying distance of the particle in the new algorithm is smaller than that in the original algorithm, which can avoid the particle \"fly over\" the optimal location and reduce the possibility of \"oscillation\" phenomena.

The two inertia weight adaptation strategies are based on population diversity. In the search process of an optimization algorithm, there must be a balance between exploration and exploitation. Exploration means to explore different areas of the search space in order to have high probability to find good promising solutions. Exploitation means to concentrate the search around a promising region in order to refine a candidate solution. The exploration and exploitation are two conflicted objectives of an optimization algorithm. A good optimization algorithm should optimally balance the two conflicted objectives. With the first strategy, the algorithm focus on the exploration at the beginning of the search, and focus on exploitation at the end of search. Particles' inertia weights are randomly initialized within the range [0.4,0.9], the minimum weight gets increased at the beginning of search to enhance the exploration ability, and the maximum weight gets decreased at the end of search to enhance the exploitation ability. With the second strategy, particles' inertia weights are set at the same value, and this value is adaptively changed according to the distance between the gbest and the centre of swarm. The porposed PSOs are compared with the standard PSO. Experimental results show that a PSO with adaptive inertia weight could obtain performance as good as the standard PSO, and even better on some multimodal problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463194","pdfPath":"/iel7/6449391/6462631/06463194.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"403","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Population diversity based inertia weight adaptation in Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Population diversity based inertia weight adaptation in Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13326945","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6463194/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population diversity based inertia weight adaptation in Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"IAT0135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064205S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449391","isNumber":"6462631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449391","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6462631","articleId":"6463194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463195,"authors":[{"name":"Gajanan K.

In this paper we present a robust neural aggregation method for matching correspondences in stereoscopic color image. A data structure disparity space image (DSI) was firstly introduced for development of a local-based matching algorithm. To make good use of color information, stereo images were represented by RGB model, and the initial disparity dense map of correspond RGB channels were computed using NCC (normalized cross-correlation) based on DSI matching algorithm. The neural network performed the similarity aggregation of RGB channels, and the aggregated method shown not only a better overall behavior, but also the neural will improve the robustness of area-based matching methods which depend on the proper selection of window shape and size. The experimental analysis makes a comparison with other methods that show neural aggregation with more matching accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463240/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13326991","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463240/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel with RBF neural network aggregation based on disparity space for color image stereo matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel with RBF neural network aggregation based on disparity space for color image stereo matching","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"IPR0277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070771S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449391","isNumber":"6462631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449391","xplore-issue":"6462631","articleId":"6463240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6463244,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiling Luo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China"],"firstName":"Ruiling","lastName":"Luo","id":"37871646100"},{"name":"Wenqing Cai","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China"],"firstName":"Wenqing","lastName":"Cai","id":"38023050500"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"38026254600"},{"name":"Dongqin Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China"],"firstName":"Dongqin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37065740000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1744-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1743-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1742-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463244","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Particle swarm optimization","Speaker recognition","Convergence","Training","Optimization","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","speaker recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved particle swarm optimization algorithm","speaker recognition","IPSO","improved PSO","evolution speed factor","trigger conditions","local optimal solution","convergence velocity","evolutionary optimization","global exploration","local exploration","support vector machine","SVM training","classification accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463244","abstract":"Considering the Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) is easily relapsing into local extremum, an improved PSO(IPSO) is proposed in this paper.

In this algorithm, first used the fuzzy clustering analysis method to do the initial clustering, with an initial data width equal to the minimum distance between sets; then applied the Orthogonal Least Squares method to train a new data center, and the number of weights, and modify the width; finally used the gradient descent algorithm to train and adjust the center, the weight and the width. By combining these algorithms and further optimization, the generalization performance of the network is much improved. Because of the large number of precipitation affecting factors, pretreated the sample data using the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) for feature extraction to reduce dimensionality.

The results show that, the model has good generalization performance, and the forecasting accuracy is higher than that of T213 precipitation forecast model, thus this model has certain promotion value.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463271","startPage":"766","endPage":"771","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6449391/6462631/06463271.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel radial basis function neural network for rainfall forecasting based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Predictive models","Radial basis function networks","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","Gaussian processes","geophysics computing","gradient methods","least squares approximations","pattern clustering","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks","rain","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network","rainfall forecasting","kernel principal component analysis","RBF network","hidden layer nodes","hidden layer centers","hidden layer width","network performance improvement","fuzzy clustering algorithm","RBF algorithm","Gauss kernel function","fuzzy clustering analysis method","initial data width","orthogonal least squares method","data center","gradient descent algorithm","KPCA","feature extraction","dimensionality reduction","Guangxi","T213 precipitation forecast model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel radial basis function neural network for rainfall forecasting based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463271/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13327022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel radial basis function neural network for rainfall forecasting based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"MMC0379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063697S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449391","isNumber":"6462631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449391","xplore-issue":"6462631","articleId":"6463271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463285,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Shanghai, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086755664"},{"name":"Jia Jia","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Shanghai, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Jia","id":"38548133900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1744-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1743-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1742-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463285","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control theory","Stability","Robustness","Biological neural networks","Delay","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","linear matrix inequalities","neural nets","time-varying networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global robust exponential stability","Cohen-Grossberg neural network","time-varying delay","sufficient conditions","equilibrium point","linear matrix inequality technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463285","abstract":"Global robust exponential stability problems for Cohen-Grossberg neural networks are investigated in this paper.

In this paper, a block sparsity adaptive regularized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (BAROMP) for compressive sensing is presented. The proposed algorithm could guarantee the accuracy of recovery by both the adaptive process which chooses the candidate set automatically and the regularization process which decides the atoms in the final support set.

When combining turbo codes with HARQ, the associated complexity becomes a critical issue, since conventionally iterative decoding is immediately activated after each transmission, even though the iterative decoder might fail in delivering an error-free codeword even after a high number of iterations. In this scenario, precious battery-power would be wasted. In order to reduce the associated complexity, we will present design examples based on Multiple Components Turbo Codes (MCTCs) and demonstrate that they are capable of achieving an excellent performance based on the lowest possible memory octally represented generator polynomial (2, 3)\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n. In addition to using low-complexity generator polynomials, we detail two further techniques conceived for reducing the complexity. Firstly, an Early Stopping (ES) strategy is invoked for curtailing iterative decoding, when its Mutual Information (MI) improvements become less than a given threshold. Secondly, a novel Deferred Iteration (DI) strategy is advocated for the sake of delaying iterative decoding, until the receiver confidently estimates that it has received sufficient information for successful decoding. Our simulation results demonstrate that the MCTC aided HARQ schemes are capable of significantly reducing the complexity of the appropriately selected benchmarkers, which is achieved without degrading the Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.013013.00079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6661627/06463373.pdf","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.013013.00079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey and Tutorial on Low-Complexity Turbo Coding Techniques and a Holistic Hybrid ARQ Design Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Survey and Tutorial on Low-Complexity Turbo Coding Techniques and a Holistic Hybrid ARQ Design Example","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6463373/","accessionNumber":"13897582","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey and Tutorial on Low-Complexity Turbo Coding Techniques and a Holistic Hybrid ARQ Design Example","sourcePdf":"03Hanzo79.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135935S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6661627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6661627","articleId":"6463373","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6463374,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Charfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ENIS) at SFAX, University of SFAX"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6661627/6463374/6463374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emna Charfi was born in MONASTIR, TUNISIA, in 1985.

The first generation of high throughput networks known as IEEE 802.11n was developed in 2009 to reach 130 Mbps. Furthermore, to enhance the throughput, two new amendments for IEEE 802.11 are under developments which are IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ac. The first one aims to reach 1Gbps with supporting multi-user access techniques. The second amendment aims to enable up to 7Gbp with the possibility of transmitting in the 60GHz band that provides the opportunity for much wider band channels. Another WLAN is already finalized called IEEE 802.11aa in the goal to provide a reliable multicast transport for video streaming. In this survey, we examine the different PHY and MAC enhancements introduced by all these WLAN specifications. Particularly, we focus on the characteristics of each amendment as well as the main MAC mechanisms that lead to improve the network performance. Based on the fact that all recent MAC mechanisms aim to increase QoS guarantee for real time multimedia applications, we have studied different schemes and mechanisms that provide QoS satisfaction for real time multimedia flows transport over WLANs. Namely, we investigate the scheduling mechanisms, the call admission control algorithms, and the anticipated MAC enhancement which are proposed for WLANs networks to support real time applications with QoS satisfaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","volume":"15","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13913980","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463374/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"PHY/MAC Enhancements and QoS Mechanisms for Very High Throughput WLANs: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PHY/MAC Enhancements and QoS Mechanisms for Very High Throughput WLANs: A Survey","sourcePdf":"10charfi84.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117312S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6661627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6463374","articleId":"6463374","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463375,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Bassoli","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Riccardo Bassoli is a Ph.D. student at Centre for Communications Systems Research (CCSR), Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, The University of Surrey in the UK.

Virtualization allows to instantiate one or more virtual machines (VMs) on top of a single physical machine managed by a virtual machine monitor (VMM). Similarly to any other software, a VMM experiences aging and failures. Software rejuvenation is a proactive fault management technique that involves terminating an application, cleaning up the system internal state, and restarting it to prevent the occurrence of future failures. In this work, we propose a technique to model and evaluate the VMM aging process and to investigate the optimal rejuvenation policy that maximizes the VMM availability under variable workload conditions. Starting from dynamic reliability theory and adopting symbolic algebraic techniques, we investigate and compare existing time-based VMM rejuvenation policies. We also propose a time-based policy that adapts the rejuvenation timer to the VMM workload condition improving the system availability. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling technique is demonstrated through a numerical example based on a case study taken from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6509861/06463380.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6509861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.30","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Workload-Based Software Rejuvenation in Cloud Systems","volume":"62","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463380/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13475362","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463380/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workload-Based Software Rejuvenation in Cloud Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2013061072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124094S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6509861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6509861","articleId":"6463380","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6463381,"authors":[{"name":"Chrysa Papagianni","affiliation":["Division of Communication, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6509861/6463381/6463381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chrysa Papagianni received the diploma degree and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering, both from NTUA in 2003 and 2009, respectively.

Moving away from traditional data-center oriented models, distributed clouds extend over a loosely coupled federated substrate, offering enhanced communication and computational services to target end-users with quality of service (QoS) requirements, as dictated by the future Internet vision. Toward facilitating the efficient realization of such networked computing environments, computing and networking resources need to be jointly treated and optimized. This requires delivery of user-driven sets of virtual resources, dynamically allocated to actual substrate resources within networked clouds, creating the need to revisit resource mapping algorithms and tailor them to a composite virtual resource mapping problem. In this paper, toward providing a unified resource allocation framework for networked clouds, we first formulate the optimal networked cloud mapping problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, indicating objectives related to cost efficiency of the resource mapping procedure, while abiding by user requests for QoS-aware virtual resources. We subsequently propose a method for the efficient mapping of resource requests onto a shared substrate interconnecting various islands of computing resources, and adopt a heuristic methodology to address the problem. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated in a simulation/emulation environment, that allows for a flexible, structured, and comparative performance evaluation. We conclude by outlining a proof-of-concept realization of our proposed schema, mounted over the European future Internet test-bed FEDERICA, a resource virtualization platform augmented with network and computing facilities.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.31","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6509861/06463381.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6509861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimal allocation of virtual resources in cloud computing networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463381/","displayDocTitle":"On the optimal allocation of virtual resources in cloud computing networks","volume":"62","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463381/","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13475363","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimal allocation of virtual resources in cloud computing networks","sourcePdf":"ttc2013061060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094755S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6509861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6509861","articleId":"6463381","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6463384,"authors":[{"name":"Haider A.F.

In order to solve the non-linear cost compression problem efficiently, we propose an encoding symbol frequency based approach. We first compute frequencies of encoding symbols to minimize a cost function. To achieve the computed frequencies of a cost-compressed message, we deploy existing size-decompression algorithms.

With traditional metal interconnects facing stringent energy constraints, researchers are currently pursuing disruptive solutions such as nanophotonics for improved energy-efficiency. Cache coherence in multicores can be enforced effectively by snoopy protocols; however, broadcasting every cache miss can limit the scalability while consuming excess energy. In this paper, we propose PULSE, a nanophotonic broadcast tree-based network for snoopy cache coherent multicores. To limit the energy-penalty from broadcasting (and thereby splitting) optical signals, we direct the optical signal from the external laser such that only the subset of requesters can receive the optical signal. Furthermore, as cache blocks are shared by a few cores, we propose a multicast version of PULSE called multi-PULSE that predicts the sharers' for each L2 miss and morphing the broadcast to a multicast network. We evaluate the energy and performance using CACTI and SIMICS on 16-core and 64-core versions of PULSE and multi-PULSE for Splash-2, PARSEC, and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and compare to electrical networks, optical networks, and another cache filtering techniques. Our results indicate that PULSE outperforms competitive electrical/optical networks by 60 percent in terms of execution time, and multi-PULSE reduces average energy from 10 to 80 percent even with a few mispredictions.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.26","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6674937/06463390.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the Performance and Energy-Efficiency of Shared Memory Multicores with Nanophotonic Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Extending the Performance and Energy-Efficiency of Shared Memory Multicores with Nanophotonic Technology","volume":"25","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463390/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13934331","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463390/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the Performance and Energy-Efficiency of Shared Memory Multicores with Nanophotonic Technology","sourcePdf":"ttd2014010083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121954S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6674937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6674937","articleId":"6463390","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463393,"authors":[{"name":"Manel Bourguiba","affiliation":["Paris-Sud University, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France"],"bio":{"p":["Manel Bourguiba received the engineering and the MS degrees in computer science from the National School of Computer Science, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

It enhances resource availability and offers high flexibility and cost effectiveness. However, the driver domain-based model for network I/O virtualization exhibit poor networking performance. In this paper, we evaluate the networking performance of VMs based on Xen. The I/O channel transferring packets between the driver domain and the VMs is shown to be the bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a packet aggregation-based mechanism to transfer packets from the driver domain to the VM. Experimental performance evaluation showed that our proposal allows the VMs throughput to scale up at line rates. Furthermore, we studied the impact of the aggregation on the packets delay. For this purpose, we proposed a system modeling based on queuing theory. The proposed model allowed us to dynamically tune the aggregation mechanism to achieve the best tradeoff between the packets delay and throughput. The proposed I/O virtualization model henceforth satisfies the infrastructure providers to offer cloud computing services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Network I/O Virtualization for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.29","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6731354/06463393.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6731354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Improving Network I/O Virtualization for Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6463393/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14078246","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Network I/O Virtualization for Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"ttd2014030673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0593S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6731354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6731354","articleId":"6463393","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463394,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Hackmann","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO"],"bio":{"p":["Gregory Hackmann received the PhD degree in computer science from Washington University in St. Louis in 2011.

While preserving user privacy, conventional systems have addressed this issue by proposing methods based on the observation of streamed traffic throughout the network. These conventional systems maintain a high detection accuracy while coping with some of the traffic variation in the network (e.g., network delay and packet loss), however, their detection performance substantially degrades owing to the significant variation of video lengths. In this paper, we focus on overcoming this issue by proposing a novel content-leakage detection scheme that is robust to the variation of the video length. By comparing videos of different lengths, we determine a relation between the length of videos to be compared and the similarity between the compared videos. Therefore, we enhance the detection performance of the proposed scheme even in an environment subjected to variation in length of video. Through a testbed experiment, the effectiveness of our proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of variation of video length, delay variation, and packet loss.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6689796/06463398.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"309","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Pattern-Based Content Leakage Detection for Trusted Content Delivery Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Pattern-Based Content Leakage Detection for Trusted Content Delivery Networks","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6463398/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13991686","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Pattern-Based Content Leakage Detection for Trusted Content Delivery Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2014020301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6689796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6689796","articleId":"6463398","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463400,"authors":[{"name":"Rinku Dewri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Denver, Denver, CO"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6689796/6463400/6463400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rinku Dewri received the PhD degree in computer science from Colorado State University.

However, location knowledge is often perceived as personal information. One of the immediate issues hindering the wide acceptance of location-based applications is the lack of appropriate methodologies that offer fine grain privacy controls to a user without vastly affecting the usability of the service. While a number of privacy-preserving models and algorithms have taken shape in the past few years, there is an almost universal need to specify one's privacy requirement without understanding its implications on the service quality. In this paper, we propose a user-centric location-based service architecture where a user can observe the impact of location inaccuracy on the service accuracy before deciding the geo-coordinates to use in a query. We construct a local search application based on this architecture and demonstrate how meaningful information can be exchanged between the user and the service provider to allow the inference of contours depicting the change in query results across a geographic area. Results indicate the possibility of large default privacy regions (areas of no change in result set) in such applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.34","startPage":"374","endPage":"383","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6689796/06463400.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Service Similarity for Privacy in Location-Based Search Queries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Accuracy","Business","Databases","Usability","Service oriented architecture","Data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","mobile computing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service similarity","location-based search query","location-based applications","positioning capability","mobile device","user location","neighboring points","location knowledge","personal information","privacy control","privacy-preserving models","privacy requirement","service quality","user-centric location-based service architecture","location inaccuracy","service accuracy","geo-coordinates","search application","meaningful information","service provider","default privacy regions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy","Accuracy","Business","Databases","Usability","Service oriented architecture","Data privacy","service quality","Privacy-supportive LBS","location privacy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Service Similarity for Privacy in Location-Based Search Queries","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6463400/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13991699","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Service Similarity for Privacy in Location-Based Search Queries","sourcePdf":"ttd2014020374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047898S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6689796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6689796","articleId":"6463400","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":6463401,"authors":[{"name":"Linghe Kong","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6674937/6463401/6463401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Linghe Kong received the BE degree in the Automation Department from Xidian University, China, in 2005, and the Dipl Ing degree in telecommunication from TELECOM SudParis (ex.

Conventional studies on this topic focus on 2D ideal plane coverage and 3D full space coverage. The 3D surface of a field of interest (FoI) is complex in many real-world applications. However, existing coverage studies do not produce practical results. In this paper, we propose a new coverage model called surface coverage. In surface coverage, the field of interest is a complex surface in 3D space and sensors can be deployed only on the surface. We show that existing 2D plane coverage is merely a special case of surface coverage. Simulations point out that existing sensor deployment schemes for a 2D plane cannot be directly applied to surface coverage cases. Thus, we target two problems assuming cases of surface coverage to be true. One, under stochastic deployment, what is the expected coverage ratio when a number of sensors are adopted? Two, if sensor deployment can be planned, what is the optimal deployment strategy with guaranteed full coverage with the least number of sensors? We show that the latter problem is NP-complete and propose three approximation algorithms. We further prove that these algorithms have a provable approximation ratio. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6674937/06463401.pdf","endPage":"243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Coverage in Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.35","startPage":"234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Surface Coverage in Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463401/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13934319","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6463401/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Coverage in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2014010234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098485S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6674937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6674937","articleId":"6463401","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463402,"authors":[{"name":"Haojin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6674937/6463402/6463402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haojin Zhu (M'09) received the BSc degree in 2002 from Wuhan University, China, the MSc degree in 2005 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, both in computer science, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2009.

Due to the unique network characteristics, designing a misbehavior detection scheme in DTN is regarded as a great challenge. In this paper, we propose iTrust, a probabilistic misbehavior detection scheme, for secure DTN routing toward efficient trust establishment. The basic idea of iTrust is introducing a periodically available Trusted Authority (TA) to judge the node's behavior based on the collected routing evidences and probabilistically checking. We model iTrust as the inspection game and use game theoretical analysis to demonstrate that, by setting an appropriate investigation probability, TA could ensure the security of DTN routing at a reduced cost. To further improve the efficiency of the proposed scheme, we correlate detection probability with a node's reputation, which allows a dynamic detection probability determined by the trust of the users. The extensive analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","volume":"25","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13934314","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463402/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Misbehavior Detection Scheme toward Efficient Trust Establishment in Delay-Tolerant Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Misbehavior Detection Scheme toward Efficient Trust Establishment in Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2014010022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082732S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6674937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6674937","articleId":"6463402","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463406,"authors":[{"name":"Kasim Sinan Yildirim","affiliation":["The Department of Computer Engineering, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6674937/6463406/6463406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kasim Sinan Yildirim received the SSc, MSc, and PhD degrees in computer engineering from Ege University, izmir, Turkey in 2003, 2006, and 2012, respectively.

To achieve network-wide time synchronization, a common strategy is to flood current time information of a reference node into the network, which is utilized by the de facto time-synchronization protocol Flooding Time-Synchronization Protocol (FTSP). In FTSP, the propagation speed of the flood is slow because each node waits for a given period of time to propagate its time information about the reference node. It has been shown that slow-flooding decreases the synchronization accuracy and scalability of FTSP drastically. Alternatively, rapid-flooding approach is proposed in the literature, which allows nodes to propagate time information as quickly as possible. However, rapid flooding is difficult and has several drawbacks in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, our aim is to reduce the undesired effect of slow-flooding on the synchronization accuracy without changing the propagation speed of the flood. Within this context, we realize that the smaller the difference between the speeds of the clocks, the smaller the undesired effect of waiting times on the synchronization accuracy. In the light of this realization, our main contribution is to show that the synchronization accuracy and scalability of slow-flooding can drastically be improved by employing a clock speed agreement algorithm among the sensor nodes. We present an evaluation of this strategy on a testbed setup including 20 MICAz sensor nodes. Our theoretical findings and experimental results show that employing a clock speed agreement algorithm among the sensor nodes drastically improves the synchronization accuracy and scalability of slow-flooding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Synchronization Based on Slow-Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.40","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6674937/06463406.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Time Synchronization Based on Slow-Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6463406/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13934325","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Synchronization Based on Slow-Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2014010244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062009S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6674937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6674937","articleId":"6463406","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6463407,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liu","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Computer, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6674937/6463407/6463407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Liu received the BS and MS degrees from the School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

Proven to be NP-hard, the influence maximization problem attracts tremendous studies. Though there exist basic greedy algorithms which may provide good approximation to optimal result, they mainly suffer from low computational efficiency and excessively long execution time, limiting the application to large-scale social networks. In this paper, we present IMGPU, a novel framework to accelerate the influence maximization by leveraging the parallel processing capability of graphics processing unit (GPU). We first improve the existing greedy algorithms and design a bottom-up traversal algorithm with GPU implementation, which contains inherent parallelism. To best fit the proposed influence maximization algorithm with the GPU architecture, we further develop an adaptive K-level combination method to maximize the parallelism and reorganize the influence graph to minimize the potential divergence. We carry out comprehensive experiments with both real-world and sythetic social network traces and demonstrate that with IMGPU framework, we are able to outperform the state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithm up to a factor of 60, and show potential to scale up to extraordinarily large-scale networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674937","startPage":"136","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6674937/06463407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IMGPU: GPU-Accelerated Influence Maximization in Large-Scale Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6463407/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"IMGPU: GPU-Accelerated Influence Maximization in Large-Scale Social Networks","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13934317","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IMGPU: GPU-Accelerated Influence Maximization in Large-Scale Social Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2014010136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104975S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6674937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6674937","articleId":"6463407","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463419,"authors":[{"name":"Yonggang Chen","affiliation":["Alabama Micro/Nano Science and Technology Center and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6504509/6463419/6463419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonggang Chen (M'06) was born in Taiyuan, China, in 1968.

With further optimizations, the tag can be used in the item-level tracking and identification applications, especially for the management of paper tickets and banknotes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6478802/06463426.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2247556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directly Printed Packaging-Paper-Based Chipless RFID Tag With Coplanar - Resonator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Encoding","Printing","Packaging","Resonant frequency","Conductivity","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ink jet printing","LC circuits","modulation coding","network synthesis","packaging","paper","phase modulation","radiofrequency identification","resonators","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inkjet printing","banknote management","paper ticket management","identification application","item-level tracking","vector network analyzer","sweeping frequency signal","overprinting process","coding capacity enhancement","PPM coding","phase position modulation coding","reconfigurable LC resonance circuit","ID-generating circuit design","coplanar LC resonator","chipless RFID tag","printed packaging paper","word length 4.25 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inkjet printing","$LC$ resonator","packaging paper","phase position modulation (PPM)","radio frequency identification (RFID)","reconfigurable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Directly Printed Packaging-Paper-Based Chipless RFID Tag With Coplanar <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex> </formula> Resonator","volume":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6463426/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2013","accessionNumber":"13387289","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directly Printed Packaging-Paper-Based Chipless RFID Tag With Coplanar <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex> </formula> Resonator","sourcePdf":"lawp-shao-2247556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079245S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6478802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6478802","articleId":"6463426","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463433,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Ushijima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Ushijima","id":"37529310700"},{"name":"Tatsuya Sakamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"38237764200"},{"name":"Eisuke Nishiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Eisuke","lastName":"Nishiyama","id":"37266369300"},{"name":"Masayoshi Aikawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Aikawa","id":"38268589000"},{"name":"Ichihiko Toyoda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichihiko","lastName":"Toyoda","id":"37284669500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6463433","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1495},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463433","abstract":"A 5.8-GHz integrated differential rectifying antenna (rectenna) unit with design flexibility is proposed, and its performance is confirmed experimentally.

The WINeR-6 Rx consists of four parts: 1) RF front end; 2) signal conditioning; 3) analog output (AO); and 4) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) back end. The RF front end receives RF-modulated neural signals in the 403-490 MHz band with a wide bandwidth of 18 MHz. The frequency-shift keying (FSK) PWM demodulator in the FPGA is a time-to-digital converter with 304 ps resolution, which converts the analog pulse width information to 16-bit digital samples. Automated frequency tracking has been implemented in the Rx to lock onto the free-running voltage-controlled oscillator in the transmitter (Tx). Two antennas and two parallel RF paths are used to increase the wireless coverage area. BCI-2000 graphical user interface has been adopted and modified to acquire, visualize, and record the recovered neural signals in real time. The AO module picks three demultiplexed channels and converts them into analog signals for direct observation on an oscilloscope. One of these signals is further amplified to generate an audio output, offering users the ability to listen to ongoing neural activity. Bench-top testing of the Rx performance with a 32-channel WINeR-6 Tx showed that the input referred noise of the entire system at a Tx-Rx distance of 1.5 m was 4.58 \u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n with 8-bit resolution at 640 kSps. In an in vivo experiment, location-specific receptive fields of hippocampal place cells were mapped during a behavioral experiment in which a rat completed 40 laps in a large circular track. Results were compared against those acquired from the same animal and the same set of electrodes by a commercial hardwired recording system to validate the wirelessly recorded signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","volume":"60","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"13583236","pubMedId":"23428612","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463438/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Dual-Antenna Receiver for Wireless Recording From Animals Behaving in Large Arenas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Dual-Antenna Receiver for Wireless Recording From Animals Behaving in Large Arenas","sourcePdf":"tbme-ghovanloo-2247603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111054S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6532373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6532373","articleId":"6463438","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463440,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yin Chen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), Katholieke\u00a0Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6463440/6463440-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Yin Chen (S'06) received the joint M.

Specifically, in the media cloud, each content is transcoded into a set of media files with diverse playback rates, and appropriate files will be dynamically chosen in response to channel conditions and screen forms. Our design objective is to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of an individual content for the end users, under a limited storage budget. Deriving a logarithmic QoE model from our experimental results, we formulate the individual content cache management for HTTP ABR streaming over wireless network as a constrained convex optimization problem. We adopt a two-step process to solve the snapshot problem. First, using the Lagrange multiplier method, we obtain the numerical solution of the set of playback rates for a fixed number of cache copies and characterize the optimal solution analytically. Our investigation reveals a fundamental phase change in the optimal solution as the number of cached files increases. Second, we develop three alternative search algorithms to find the optimal number of cached files, and compare their scalability under average and worst complexity metrics. Our numerical results suggest that, under optimal cache schemes, the maximum QoE measurement, i.e., mean-opinion-score (MOS), is a concave function of the allowable storage size. Our cache management can provide high expected QoE with low complexity, shedding light on the design of HTTP ABR streaming services over wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2247583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6599014/06463456.pdf","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2247583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-Driven Cache Management for HTTP Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming Over Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463456/","displayDocTitle":"QoE-Driven Cache Management for HTTP Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming Over Wireless Networks","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13766225","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463456/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-Driven Cache Management for HTTP Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming Over Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-zhang-2247583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129643S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6599014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6599014","articleId":"6463456","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6463460,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6504823/6463460/6463460-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Huang (S'10) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in communications and information systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2009.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine.

Since the relay is untrusted, it is desirable to protect the confidential data from it while simultaneously making use of it to increase the reliability of the transmission. We first examine the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the network assuming a single antenna relay, and calculate the exact SOP for three different schemes: direct transmission without using the relay, conventional non-regenerative relaying, and cooperative jamming by the destination. Subsequently, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of the SOPs to determine the optimal policies in different operating regimes. We then generalize to the multi-antenna relay case and investigate the impact of the number of relay antennas on the secrecy performance. Finally, we study a scenario where the relay has only a single RF chain which necessitates an antenna selection scheme, and we show that unlike the case where all antennas are used, under certain conditions the cooperative jamming scheme with antenna selection provides a diversity advantage for the receiver. Numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical predictions of the preferred transmission policies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","volume":"61","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13474413","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2013","publicationDate":"May15, 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6463460/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication Via an Untrusted Non-Regenerative Relay in Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication Via an Untrusted Non-Regenerative Relay in Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2247600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094451S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6504823","articleId":"6463460","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463462,"authors":[{"name":"Petri Komulainen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6492148/6463462/6463462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Petri Komulainen (S'08) received the M.Sc.

The iterative processing consists of optimization steps that are run locally by base stations (BS), and facilitated by a combination of over-the-air uplink pilot signaling and scalar backhaul information exchange. In the first novel strategy, the coordinating cells update their transmit precoders and receivers by executing a cell-specific optimization loop one cell at a time, which guarantees monotonic convergence of the network-wide problem. The strategy employs separate uplink channel sounding (CS) and busy burst (BB) signaling to reveal the effective channels of the terminals to the neighboring BSs. In the second strategy, we sacrifice the monotonic convergence and devise a faster scheme where the BSs are allowed to optimize their variables in parallel based on just the CS responses and additional backhaul information. We make use of the optimization framework where the WSR maximization is carried out via weighted sum mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization, and generalize the approach by employing antenna-specific transmit power constraints. The numerical results demonstrate that WSR maximization has the desirable property that spatial scheduling, or user and beam selection, is carried out implicitly.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2247597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6492148/06463462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2247597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492148","startPage":"2204","endPage":"2218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective CSI Signaling and Decentralized Beam Coordination in TDD Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effective CSI Signaling and Decentralized Beam Coordination in TDD Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","publicationDate":"May1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13412990","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6463462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective CSI Signaling and Decentralized Beam Coordination in TDD Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-komulainen-2247597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112839S","chronDate":"May1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6492148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6492148","articleId":"6463462","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6463463,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Lim","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6504823/6463463/6463463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabian Lim (S'06\u2013M'10) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the National University of Singapore in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hawaii, Manoa, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.

This paper proposes using these statistics for analyzing random compressed sensing matrices, in the non-asymptotic regime (relevant to practice). The aim is to address certain pessimisms of \"worst-case\" restricted isometry analyses, as observed by both Blanchard & Dossal, et. al. We show how U-statistics can obtain \"average-case\" analyses, by relating to statistical restricted isometry property (StRIP) type recovery guarantees. However unlike standard StRIP, random signal models are not required; the analysis here holds in the almost sure (probabilistic) sense.

In this paper, we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and reconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show that mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in sensing bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor encounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a time-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal received at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a configuration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel lines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of motion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a sampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in sampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of nonuniform sensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples, we demonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical problems. We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring time-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors. We demonstrate that in some situations we require a lower density of sensors when using a mobile sensing scheme instead of the conventional static sensing scheme. The exact advantage is quantified for a problem of sampling and reconstructing an audio field.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2247599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2247599","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2340","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6492148/06463464.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and Reconstruction of Spatial Fields Using Mobile Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and Reconstruction of Spatial Fields Using Mobile Sensors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","volume":"61","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463464/","accessionNumber":"13428269","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463464/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and Reconstruction of Spatial Fields Using Mobile Sensors","sourcePdf":"tsp-unnikrishnan-2247599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097025S","chronDate":"May1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6492148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6492148","articleId":"6463464","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6463465,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Gu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6541987/6463465/6463465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanfeng Gu (M'09) was born in Jiamusi, China, in 1977.

However, using the Euclidean distance to construct weights, the graph in LapSVM may not really represent the inherent distribution of the data. In this paper, optimized LapSVMs are developed for semisupervised hyperspectral image classification, by introducing distance metric learning instead of the traditional Euclidean distance which is used in the existing LapSVM. In the procedure of constructing graph with distance metric learning, equivalence and non-equivalence pairwise constraints are imposed for better capturing similarity of samples from different classes. In this way, two new optimization problems are reformulated for building LapSVM with normalized and unnormalized graph Laplacian respectively. Experiments are conducted on two real hyperspectral datasets. Corresponding results obtained with low number of labeled training samples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods for hyperspectral image classification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Laplacian SVM With Distance Metric Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2243112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6541987/06463465.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2243112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6541987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Laplacian SVM With Distance Metric Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6463465/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13583007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimized Laplacian SVM With Distance Metric Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jstars-gu-2243112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068239S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6541987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6541987","articleId":"6463465","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463468,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Wen Tang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-Tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6472304/6463468/6463468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Wen Tang (S'02\u2013M'03\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan, in 1991, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1996 and 2002, respectively.","Since February 2003, he has been a Professor with the Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, where he currently holds a joint appointment with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Telecommunication Research. from 1997 to 2001, he was an RF Engineer with the RF Communication Systems Technology Department, Computer and Communication Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he was involved in the development of low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) multilayer-circuit RF components. from 2001 to 2003, he was a Project Manager with Phycomp Taiwan Ltd., Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where he was involved in the development of LTCC components and modules.

We propose a co-optimization framework that allows the robot to plan its motion speed, transmission rate and stop time, based on its probabilistic prediction of the channel quality along the trajectory. We show that in order to save energy, the robot should move faster (slower) and send less (more) bits at the locations that have worse (better) predicted channel qualities. We furthermore prove that if the robot must stop, it should then stop only once and at the location with the best predicted channel quality. We also prove some properties for two special scenarios: the heavy-task load and the light-task load cases. We also propose an additional stop-time online adaptation strategy to further fine tune the stop location as the robot moves along its trajectory and measures the true value of the channel. Finally, our simulation results show that our proposed framework results in a considerable performance improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13475878","htmlLink":"/document/6463490/","displayDocTitle":"Co-Optimization of Communication and Motion Planning of a Robotic Operation under Resource Constraints and in Fading Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-Optimization of Communication and Motion Planning of a Robotic Operation under Resource Constraints and in Fading Environments","sourcePdf":"1562-tw1304-yan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08055S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6463490","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463491,"authors":[{"name":"Nidal Nasser","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department College of Engineering, Alfaisal University, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6507664/6463491/6463491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nidal Nasser Dr. Nidal Nasser received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees with Honors in Computer Engineering from Kuwait University, State of Kuwait, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.

Most of the existing packet-scheduling mechanisms of WSN use First Come First Served (FCFS), non-preemptive priority and preemptive priority scheduling algorithms. These algorithms incur a high processing overhead and long end-to-end data transmission delay due to the FCFS concept, starvation of high priority real-time data packets due to the transmission of a large data packet in nonpreemptive priority scheduling, starvation of non-real-time data packets due to the probable continuous arrival of real-time data in preemptive priority scheduling, and improper allocation of data packets to queues in multilevel queue scheduling algorithms. Moreover, these algorithms are not dynamic to the changing requirements of WSN applications since their scheduling policies are predetermined. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multilevel Priority (DMP) packet scheduling scheme. In the proposed scheme, each node, except those at the last level of the virtual hierarchy in the zone-based topology of WSN, has three levels of priority queues. Real-time packets are placed into the highest-priority queue and can preempt data packets in other queues. Non-real-time packets are placed into two other queues based on a certain threshold of their estimated processing time. Leaf nodes have two queues for real-time and non-real-time data packets since they do not receive data from other nodes and thus, reduce end-to-end delay. We evaluate the performance of the proposed DMP packet scheduling scheme through simulations for real-time and non-real-time data. Simulation results illustrate that the DMP packet scheduling scheme outperforms conventional schemes in terms of average data waiting time and end-to-end delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463491/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","volume":"12","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13475879","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463491/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Multilevel Priority Packet Scheduling Scheme for Wireless Sensor Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Multilevel Priority Packet Scheduling Scheme for Wireless Sensor Network","sourcePdf":"1448-tw1304-nasser.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084513S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6463491","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463493,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, which relaxes the concerned nonconvex quadratic constraints by (convex) semi-definite ones, can locate the optimal solutions, provided that the numbers of relaying antennas and users are very small. The computational complexity of the SDR grows explosively even with a very moderate increase in the numbers of relaying antennas and/or users, making the existing semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers incapable. In this paper, much more efficient problem formulations of precoding matrix design that exploit the spectral matrix optimization are developed. Such formulations have a low dimensionality and are computationally-tractable nonconvex matrix programs. Furthermore, by exploiting their partial convex structures in the d.c. (difference of two convex functions) framework, new effective iterative solutions are obtained. Extensive simulation results are presented to support the computational advantage of the proposed approach and show that the proposed approach can effectively handle all three considered optimization problems of precoding matrices in MIMO PF relaying, while the SDR approach either is computationally impractical or fails.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.021213.120380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6507664/06463493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.021213.120380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative D.C.

Specifically, during the learning interval, the SU learns the null space by iteratively modifying the spatial orientation of its transmitted signal and measures the effect of this modification on the monotonic function that it observes. We provide simulation results demonstrating that the algorithm converges rapidly and is robust to quantization noise and other sources of interference.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.021213.120643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6507664/06463494.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.021213.120643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Null-Space Learning for MIMO Underlay Cognitive Radio with Primary User Interference Adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463494/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Null-Space Learning for MIMO Underlay Cognitive Radio with Primary User Interference Adaptation","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13475882","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463494/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Null-Space Learning for MIMO Underlay Cognitive Radio with Primary User Interference Adaptation","sourcePdf":"1722-tw1304-noam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10045S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6463494","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6463495,"authors":[{"name":"Kwangwon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6507664/6463495/6463495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kwangwon Lee (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Simulation and laboratory experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), short sensing times, and various channel conditions.

A major limitation of such models to date in the context of HCNs is the neglect of network traffic and load: all base stations (BSs) have typically been assumed to always be transmitting. Small cells in particular will have a lighter load than macrocells, and so their contribution to the network interference may be significantly overstated in a fully loaded model. This paper incorporates a flexible notion of BS load by introducing a new idea of conditionally thinning the interference field. For a K-tier HCN where BSs across tiers differ in terms of transmit power, supported data rate, deployment density, and now load, we derive the coverage probability for a typical mobile, which connects to the strongest BS signal. Conditioned on this connection, the interfering BSs of the ith tier are assumed to transmit independently with probability p%, which models the load. Assuming - reasonably - that smaller cells are more lightly loaded than macrocells, the analysis shows that adding such access points to the network always increases the coverage probability. We also observe that fully loaded models are quite pessimistic in terms of coverage.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.13.120485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6507664/06463498.pdf","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.13.120485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Aware Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Load-Aware Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463498/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13475885","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463498/","volume":"12","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Aware Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"1666-tw1304-harpreet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094673S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6463498","onlineDate":"15 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463504,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Recent development in range estimation indicates that phase difference of arrival (PDOA) shows a promising performance. PDOA technique suffers from an inherited limitation of phase difference which is restricted to the maximum of 2p radians. In this paper a robust algorithm to overcome this limitation and unwrap the phase is presented. A theoretical model has been developed to accurately unwrap the phase using the round trip time of flight. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the range even under significant Round Trip Time of Flight (RTTF) measurement error. It is shown that a wide range of time measurement errors can converge to actual distance if the frequency difference of the transmitted waves is properly selected.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463511","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463511.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid algorithm for range estimation in RFID systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463511/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid algorithm for range estimation in RFID systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370404","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463511/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid algorithm for range estimation in RFID systems","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C3LD048053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091785S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463513,"authors":[{"name":"Le\u00efla Nasraoui","affiliation":["COSIM Laboratory Higher School of Communications, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Le\u00efla","lastName":"Nasraoui","id":"37846547600"},{"name":"Le\u00efla Najjar Atallah","affiliation":["COSIM Laboratory Higher School of Communications, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Le\u00efla Najjar","lastName":"Atallah","id":"37279300000"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["MEDIATRON Laboratory Higher School of Communications, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463513","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Complexity theory","Synchronization","Correlation","OFDM","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","encoding","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","reduced complexity time synchronization","data-aided reduced-complexity approach","OFDM time synchronization","received signal","off-line design","QPSK encoding sequence","simple sign change","quantified encoding sequence","AWGN channels","multipath channels","metric calculation","sub-optimal sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Differential modulation","Encoding sequence","Off-line design","Quantification"]}],"abstract":"We here deal with a recently proposed data-aided reduced-complexity approach for OFDM time synchronization. In the considered approach, an encoding sequence generated from the preamble is differentially correlated with the received signal to estimate the frame start. In this paper, we study the off-line design of the encoding sequence. We present two efficient algorithms for deriving QPSK encoding sequence that allows replacing the differential correlation process, characterized by its high complexity, by a simple sign change. The resulting quantified encoding sequence performs well in both AWGN and multipath channels, compared to the optimal, previously used, encoding sequence. Furthermore, the complexity involved for the metric calculation, using the herein proposed encoding sequence, is reduced considerably by applying the sign change operations. The simulation results show that the use of sub-optimal sequence gives near best detection performances which are provided by the optimal sequence with lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463513","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463513.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding sequence design for a reduced complexity time synchronization approach for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463513/","displayDocTitle":"Encoding sequence design for a reduced complexity time synchronization approach for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370406","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463513/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding sequence design for a reduced complexity time synchronization approach for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C3LD028332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058624S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6463516,"authors":[{"name":"Esmaeil Amini","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, West Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Esmaeil","lastName":"Amini","id":"38567303500"},{"name":"Zahra Jeddi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, West Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Jeddi","id":"37689456000"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, West Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37273386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463516","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel architectures","Elliptic curve cryptography","Hardware","Galois fields","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Galois fields","power consumption","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit area","energy performances","power consumption","GF(2m) operands","Galois fields","scalar point multiplication","low level operations","high-throughput parallel crypto architecture","high-throughput ECC architecture","elliptic curve cryptography"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a high-throughput parallel crypto architecture that performs the low level operations for scalar point multiplication over GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) operands.

The experimental results show significant improvement in timing, throughput, and energy performances with a slight overhead in the circuit area.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463516","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463516.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-throughput ECC architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463516/","displayDocTitle":"A high-throughput ECC architecture","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463516/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370409","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-throughput ECC architecture","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C3LC048382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055834S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6463527,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In order to overcome the noise/bandwidth trade-off of the standard transimpedance configuration, an improved integrator-differentiator topology is adopted. The use of a discrete couple of matched JFETs at the differential input allows achieving very low equivalent input voltage noise (1.5nV/\u221aHz) critical with high input capacitance.

One technique which is commonly used for early detection of this type of cancer consists of analyzing sputum images. However, the analysis of sputum images is time consuming and requires highly trained personnel to avoid diagnostic errors. Image processing techniques provide a reliable tool for improving the manual screening of sputum samples. In this paper, we address the problem of extraction and segmentation the sputum cells based on the analysis of sputum color image with the aim to attain a high specificity rate and reduce the time consumed to analyze such sputum samples. In order to form general diagnostic rules, we use a Bayesian classifier to extract the sputum cells followed by using a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) to segment the extracted cells into nuclei and cytoplasm regions from the background region. The final results will be used for a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for early detection of lung cancer. We used some performance criteria such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to evaluate the proposed methods. Our methods are validated via a series of experimentation conducted with a data set of 88 images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463545/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13370435","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463545/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian classification and artificial neural network methods for lung cancer early diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian classification and artificial neural network methods for lung cancer early diagnosis","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C1LD028146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063283S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":6463547,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos G\u00f3mez Osuna","affiliation":["Dpto. de Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"G\u00f3mez Osuna","id":"37086751687"},{"name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez Marcos","affiliation":["Dpto. de Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","lastName":"S\u00e1nchez Marcos","id":"37086748518"},{"name":"Pablo Ituero","affiliation":["Dpto. de Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Ituero","id":"38274497600"},{"name":"Marisa Lopez-Vallejo","affiliation":["Dpto. de Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Marisa","lastName":"Lopez-Vallejo","id":"38271150400"},{"name":"Marisa L\u00f3pez-Vallejo","firstName":"Marisa","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Vallejo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463547","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Monitoring","Temperature measurement","Clocks","Radiation detectors","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitoring infrastructure","FPGA self-awareness","digital circuit","multipurpose sensor network","life cycle","interdie variability","intradie variability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monitoring","On-Chip","FPGA","CMOS","temperature","variability","leakage","aging","dynamic adaptation"]}],"abstract":"Variabilities associated with CMOS evolution affect the yield and performance of current digital designs. FPGAs, which are widely used for fast prototyping and implementation of digital circuits, also suffer from these issues. Proactive approaches start to appear to achieve self-awareness and dynamic adaptation of these devices. To support these techniques we propose the employment of a multi-purpose sensor network. This infrastructure, through adequate use of configuration and automation tools, is able to obtain relevant data along the life cycle of an FPGA. This is realised at a very reduced cost, not only in terms of area or other limited resources, but also regarding the design effort required to define and deploy the measuring infrastructure. Our proposal has been validated by measuring inter-die and intra-die variability in different FPGA families.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463547","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463547.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A monitoring infrastructure for FPGA self-awareness and dynamic adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463547/","displayDocTitle":"A monitoring infrastructure for FPGA self-awareness and dynamic adaptation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370437","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463547/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A monitoring infrastructure for FPGA self-awareness and dynamic adaptation","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C1LC058221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05959S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6463548,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Altogether, our implementation is more versatile than recent FPGA-based neuromorphic infrastructures, allowing for fast system configuration, stimulation and monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463548","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463548.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dedicated FPGA communication architecture and design for a large-scale neuromorphic system","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370438","htmlLink":"/document/6463548/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dedicated FPGA communication architecture and design for a large-scale neuromorphic system","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C3LB018164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045017S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463552,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Albo-Canals","affiliation":["La Salle-Ramon Llull University, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Albo-Canals","id":"38547826900"},{"name":"Giovanni E.

However, reconstruction of the original signal requires high computational effort, even for problems of moderate size.

We therefore present generic high-speed FPGA implementations of two fast reconstruction algorithms: orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and approximate message passing (AMP). Our implementations also support less sparse signals, which makes them suitable for, e.g., image reconstruction. The two implementations are optimized for highly parallel processing on FPGAs and have similar hardware structures, which allows comparisons in terms of resource usage and performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463559/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13370449","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6463559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High-speed compressed sensing reconstruction on FPGA using OMP and AMP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed compressed sensing reconstruction on FPGA using OMP and AMP","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A1LC048060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077526S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463564,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We propose a new raster scan FPGA and VSLI hardware architecture, performing the GHT of a binary template shape with an input image. The architecture has a minimized critical path by the reuse of partial results and the utilization of a flat adder structure. A synchronous pixel pipeline for input image row buffering enables parallel read and write access of the partial results. By this, the architecture's critical path and hence the maximum clock frequency is independent of the template size, content and number of valid pixels in the template. The architecture was implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA device. The design reaches a pixel clock of more than 580 MHz at an exemplary image size of 512\u00d7512 pixels and a template size of 64\u00d764 pixels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463634.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"684","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critical path minimized raster scan hardware architecture for computation of the Generalized Hough Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Shape","Pipelines","Transforms","Hardware","Clocks","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critical path analysis","field programmable gate arrays","Hough transforms","image processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critical path minimized raster scan hardware architecture","generalized Hough transform","GHT","image processing transform","FPGA hardware architecture","VSLI hardware architecture","Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Critical path minimized raster scan hardware architecture for computation of the Generalized Hough Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370476","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critical path minimized raster scan hardware architecture for computation of the Generalized Hough Transform","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"B4PH098268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092556S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6463636,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Yasami","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, West Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Yasami","id":"38243446500"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, West Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37273386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463636","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Low-noise amplifiers","CMOS technology","Transistors","Power demand","Noise figure","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","microwave amplifiers","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-low power current reused CMOS low noise amplifier","X-band space application","fully integrated ultra-low power CMOS low noise amplifier","LNA","current reused technique","subthreshold region","power consumption","X-band frequency","CMOS technology","power gain","noise figure","input-referred third-order intercept point","IIP3","size 65 nm","gain 10 dB","noise figure 2.9 dB","current 125 muA","voltage 0.6 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463636","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463636.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra-low power current reused CMOS low noise amplifier for x-band space application","abstract":"This paper presents fully integrated ultra-low power CMOS low noise amplifier (LNA) for x-band space application by employing current reused technique.

It can have a significant impact on the performance of analog building blocks. To understand the effect of BTI in analog circuits, an accurate measurement of circuit parameter degradation by BTI has become very necessary. This paper proposes a measurement scheme of the input offset degradation of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) due to the BTI effect. Conventional offset measurement techniques do not take into account the BTI recovery. Therefore, the proposed scheme is targeted to measure degradation during the stressing to avoid relaxation. The concept behind the scheme is to present the offset degradation as a function of the propagation delay degradation. Simulation results are shown for the measurement circuit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Stress","Voltage measurement","Transistors","Stress measurement","Temperature measurement","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offset measurement method","BTI-induced degradation","opamps","bias temperature instability","circuit design reliability","advanced CMOS nanometer technology","analog building blocks","analog circuits","circuit parameter degradation measurement","offset degradation","operational transconductance amplifier","OTA","BTI effect","offset measurement technique","BTI recovery","propagation delay degradation","measurement circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias Temperature Instability","OTA","Input offset degradation","Measurement technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463639","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463639.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offset measurement method for accurate characterization of BTI-induced degradation in opamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Offset measurement method for accurate characterization of BTI-induced degradation in opamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463639/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463639/","accessionNumber":"13370481","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offset measurement method for accurate characterization of BTI-induced degradation in opamps","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"B4PH048185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048224S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6463643,"authors":[{"name":"Arwa Ben Dhia","affiliation":["Institut MINES-TELECOM, LTCI-CNRS, TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Arwa","lastName":"Ben Dhia","id":"37973332600"},{"name":"Lirida Naviner","affiliation":["Institut MINES-TELECOM, LTCI-CNRS, TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Lirida","lastName":"Naviner","id":"37275153700"},{"name":"Philippe Matherat","affiliation":["Institut MINES-TELECOM, LTCI-CNRS, TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Matherat","id":"37707601300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463643","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Table lookup","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM-based FPGA","fault-tolerant architecture","digital reconfigurable circuits","configurable logic block","CLB structure","butterfly shape","intrinsic redundance","butterfly architecture","bit-inversion errors","Matlab simulations","fault emulation platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logical masking","fault tolerance","reliability analysis","SRAM-based FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This work deals with fault tolerance in digital reconfigurable circuits.

Moreover, the data generation (received frames) was parallelised to avoid bottlenecks when the decoder throughput is maximum. The emulator was implemented on a Virtex-6 device a (2048,1723) RS-Based LDPC code using the normalised-MS algorithm, achieving an average throughput of 1.35 Gbps with a single core and, 5.7 Gbps with 4 cores in a single FPGA device.

Mapping MCM to modern heterogeneous field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is commonly done by either using embedded multipliers or a carry-chain dominated method using additions, subtractions and bit shifts. The use of embedded multipliers is restricted by their quantity and word size. In particular, large coefficients as required for floating point MCM may need lots of embedded multipliers for each single constant. This work presents an optimization method which is able to include a user-defined number of embedded multipliers into a fully pipelined add/shift based MCM operation. Multiplier results can be shared between several constants for resource reduction. The algorithm can be either used for finding a trade-off between DSP and logic resources or to realize large MCM blocks with less DSP resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid multiple constant multiplication for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463686","startPage":"556","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463686.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid multiple constant multiplication for FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463686/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370526","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid multiple constant multiplication for FPGAs","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"B3LD018031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068559S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6463694,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad A.

Simulations are presented to verify the operation of the circuit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6463708/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370548","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Towards a closed-loop transmitter system with integrated class-D amplifier for coupling-insensitive powering of implants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a closed-loop transmitter system with integrated class-D amplifier for coupling-insensitive powering of implants","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A1LB038303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050248S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6463715,"authors":[{"name":"Aytac Atac","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Aytac","lastName":"Atac","id":"37706207100"},{"name":"Christian Harder","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Harder","id":"38548118800"},{"name":"Ralf Wunderlich","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Wunderlich","id":"37274427900"},{"name":"Stefan Heinen","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Heinen","id":"37269356200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463715","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":796},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463715","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Bandwidth","Standards","Receivers","Layout","CMOS integrated circuits","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","delta-sigma modulation","low-power electronics","Monte Carlo methods","operational amplifiers","radio receivers","UHF amplifiers","UHF filters","VHF amplifiers","VHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power variable GBW opamp","fully differential low power operational amplifier","variable gain bandwidth product","filter design","continuous time wideband multimode \u0394\u03a3 ADC","variable baseband filters","low power multistandard receivers","capacitive loads","post layout","Monte Carlo simulations","UMC CMOS technology","frequency 60 MHz to 2 GHz","capacitance 1 pF","capacitance 2 pF","capacitance 4 pF","capacitance 8 pF","current 260 muA","current 410 muA","current 790 muA","current 1500 muA","current 1900 muA","voltage 1.2 V","size 130 nm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a fully differential low power operational amplifier (opamp) with a variable gain bandwidth (GBW) product, ranging from 60MHz to 2GHz.

In order to address this challenge, a low complexity radix-16 SISO decoder for the Max-Log- MAP algorithm is proposed in this paper. Based on the elimination of parallel paths in the radix-16 trellis diagram, architectural solutions to reduce the hardware complexity of the different blocks of a SISO decoder are detailed. Moreover, two complementary techniques are introduced order to overcome BER/FER performance degradation when turbo decoders based on the proposed SISO decoder are considered. Thus, a penalty lower than 0.05dB is observed for a 8 state binary turbo code with respect to a traditional radix-2 turbo decoder for 6 decoding iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6463718/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370557","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High speed low complexity radix-16 Max-Log-MAP SISO decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed low complexity radix-16 Max-Log-MAP SISO decoder","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"B1LD028132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050333S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6463719,"authors":[{"name":"Hazem A.

SRAM PUFs offer the advantage, over other PUF constructions, of reusing resources (memories) that already exist in many designs. However, their intrinsic noisy nature produces the so called bit flipping effect, which is a problem in circuit identification and secret key generation. The approaches reported to reduce this effect usually resort to the use of pre- and post-processing steps (such as Fuzzy Extractor structures combined with Error Correcting Codes), which increase the complexity of the system. This paper proposes a pre-processing step that reduces bit flipping problems without increasing the hardware complexity.

The image processing elements and the connectivity both to the camera and the robot are embedded in an Actel Igloo FPGA, which fits the low power consumption, reprogrammability and cost requirements. We also present two applications. The first one, related to path planning, shows how a robot with such a device is able to identify different scenarios in the process of learning how to escape from a maze using reinforcement learning. The second application is a set of interactive activities using a companion robot and requiring robot vision devised to improve the recovery of children with brain trauma. In this particular case, both the cost and power consumption requirements for the camera sensor are demanding, since the robot has to be distributed to a large number of children and low consumption is essential to keep the robot working time within the therapeutic needs.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463733","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463733.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Embedded low-power low-cost Camera Sensor based on FPGA and its applications in mobile robots","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370572","htmlLink":"/document/6463733/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded low-power low-cost Camera Sensor based on FPGA and its applications in mobile robots","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A4LE048395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068357S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463734,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Moreno Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics of Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Moreno Garc\u00eda","id":"38547952100"},{"name":"\u00d3scar Guerra Vinuesa","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics of Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"\u00d3scar","lastName":"Guerra Vinuesa","id":"38548323100"},{"name":"Roc\u00edo del R\u00edo Fern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics of Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Roc\u00edo","lastName":"del R\u00edo Fern\u00e1ndez","id":"38547688600"},{"name":"Bel\u00e9n P\u00e9rez Verd\u00fa","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics of Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Bel\u00e9n","lastName":"P\u00e9rez Verd\u00fa","id":"38254827900"},{"name":"\u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics of Sevilla, IMSE-CNM (CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"\u00c1ngel","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez V\u00e1zquez","id":"38338412500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463734","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology","Structural rings","Noise","Integrated circuit modeling","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","CMOS integrated circuits","image sensors","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon avalanche diodes","image sensors","UMC CMOS","quenching circuits","image sensor arrays","size 180 nm"]}],"abstract":"The selection, modeling and characterization of Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are presented.

The key idea is to adaptively vary both the slope of expansion and the threshold for expansion of the input signal amplitude to optimize the PAPR/BER tradeoff.

Currently, verification is believed to be the main bottleneck for expedite complex designs, consuming at least 70% of the whole system development effort. This paper proposes a new, generic hardware emulation framework to improve the observability of designs as well as reducing emulation-based verification intrusiveness. The proposed emulator provides enhanced observability and controllability of inner workings of the system when compared to commercial FPGA-based emulators and is less intrusive on the design under verification. As FPGA-vendor specific products, the proposed emulator is generic, supporting in principle any digital system design. To enhance flexibility, stimuli generation and response capture is under control of a host computer and communication between the host and the design under verification may occur through an Ethernet interface or through PCIe interfaces in supported platforms. The prototype of the proposed framework is operational and presents promising results in terms of observability and controllability enhancement, although further work is needed to improve the framework emulation performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463758","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463758.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generic FPGA emulation framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463758/","displayDocTitle":"A generic FPGA emulation framework","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463758/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generic FPGA emulation framework","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A3LC058103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045822S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6463759,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A parameterized sequential architecture has been implemented for Xilinx Spartan-6 devices. It relies on a specially handcrafted multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit implemented with DSP48A1 slices in order to perform multiply and multiply-add operations required by the algorithm. The proposed scheme uses all the features of Spartan-6 DSP slice: pre-adders, 18\u00d718 bits multiplier and the post-adders. The MAC unit takes advantage of the limited size of one of the operands. Therefore, a small number of DSP blocks is used, which increases linearly with the operand size. Results show that implementations for high precision numbers (quad) are favored in terms of performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463761","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463761.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of very high radix square root with prescaling","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370599","htmlLink":"/document/6463761/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of very high radix square root with prescaling","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A3LC028187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051545S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6463762,"authors":[{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["DETI/IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"},{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["DETI/IEETA, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Dmitri Mihhailov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Mihhailov","id":"37541162600"},{"name":"Alexander Sudnitson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sudnitson","id":"37283482500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1260-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1261-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1259-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6463762","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Sorting","Hardware","Clocks","Random access memory","Memory management","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","sorting","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based processing","tree-like structure","tree-based implementation","data sorting algorithm","FPGA circuit","hierarchical finite state machine","HFSM","computational core","data structure","N-ary tree","data representation","data processing","memory requirement","address-based method","sorted item","word length 32 bit to 64 bit"]}],"abstract":"The paper evaluates tree-based implementations of data sorting algorithms in FPGA circuits using hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) as a computational core.

In recent years such trend has also been noticeable in the design of FPGA based systems for digital signal processing. In this paper, we consider FPGA implementation of a digital signal processor that is optimized for calculation of the inner product of complex vectors. The processor allows simple cascading.

Computer vision is playing an important role in increasing autonomy of both spacecraft and robotic vehicles, however due to their increased computational complexity, they are rarely implemented onto conventional computing systems. This problem becomes far more severe whenever real-time constraints have also to be considered. This paper addresses progress on rover path planning for high mobility mars rover missions. More specifically, at SPARTAN project, a demonstrator is being developed that meets ESA's specifications for the problem of rover Localization. This problem accounts for the generation of location estimates. This process involves four distinct applications: Imaging, 3D-Reconstruction, Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Map reconstruction (SLAM). On supporting these functions we developed a novel HW/SW co-design methodology that extracts parallelism in higher algorithmic level, and thus allows the simultaneous execution of computational intensive kernels on a FPGA device, while the control flow is maintained by a low-performance CPU. Experimental results show that our implementation achieves the scopes of SPARTAN project.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463793","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450169/6463499/06463793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463499","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based path-planning of high mobility rover for future planetary missions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6463793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based path-planning of high mobility rover for future planetary missions","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463793/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13370631","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6463793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based path-planning of high mobility rover for future planetary missions","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"A1LE038387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042174S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450169","isNumber":"6463499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450169","xplore-issue":"6463499","articleId":"6463793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6463795,"authors":[{"name":"Orsalia Georgia Hazapis","affiliation":["Graduate Program Information Technologies in Medicine and Biology, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Orsalia Georgia","lastName":"Hazapis","id":"37887812000"},{"name":"Evangelos Logaras","affiliation":["Graduate Program Information Technologies in Medicine and Biology, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Logaras","id":"37687952200"},{"name":"Elias S.

estimaton in electrical systems using artificial neural networks","abstract":"This paper studies the possibility to apply the approximation power of the MLP ANN in developing an alternative method for computing the load flow when the configuration of the system does not change. If the bus admittance matrix remains the same, the bus voltages are affected only by the changes of the bus active and reactive loads, in a non-linear and predictable variation. If the network is trained with a sufficient amount of bus loading scenarios, for which the resulting bus voltages are known, then the MLP network is capable of finding with a satisfactory precision the bus voltages when providing to it new bus P and Q values. Tests are carried out on the IEEE 14 bus system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6463917/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13326266","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6463917/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Load flow estimaton in electrical systems using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load flow estimaton in electrical systems using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"0416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041387S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6428739","isNumber":"6463569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6428739","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6463569","articleId":"6463917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6463922,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Stativ\u0103","affiliation":["Power Systems Department, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia\u015fi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Stativ\u0103","id":"38547845700"},{"name":"Mihai Gavrila\u015f","affiliation":["Power Systems Department, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia\u015fi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Gavrila\u015f","id":"37352966400"},{"name":"Vasile Stahie","affiliation":["S.H.

RPL is a routing protocol adapted for information routing with low power, low storage and processing sensor devices, in static topologies commonly found in WSNs, but which is not directly designed for mobile scenarios. Specifically, RPL actively decreases control traffic, at the price of lower reactivity to topology changes. In this paper, we propose to introduce some new mechanisms to the native RPL that reconcile decrease in control traffic and reactivity. They are based on an identification of mobile nodes, and furthermore they enhance RPL behavior in case of node mobility.

However, they can also pose critical bottlenecks and ignite disasters. The complexity and high number of variables could easily go beyond the capacity of any analyst or traditional operational research paradigm. In this work, we introduce a multi-paradigm, multi-layer and multi-level behavior analysis framework which can adapt to the behavior of a target complex system. It not only learns and detects normal and abnormal behaviors, it could also suggest cognitive responses in order to increase the system resilience and its grade. The multi-paradigm nature of the framework provides a robust redundancy in order to cross-cover possible hidden aspects of each paradigm. After providing the high-level design of the framework, three different paradigms are discussed. We consider the following three paradigms: Probabilistic Behavior Analysis, Simulated Probabilistic Behavior Analysis, and Behavior-Time Profile Modeling and Analysis. To be more precise and because of paper limitations, we focus on the fault prediction in the paper as a specific event-based abnormal behavior. We consider both spontaneous and gradual failure events. The promising potential of the framework has been demonstrated using simple examples and topologies. The framework can provide an intelligent approach to balance between green and high probability of completion (or high probability of availability) aspects in computing systems.","doi":"10.1109/NOF.2012.6464008","publicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on The Network of the Future (NOF)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on The Network of the Future (NOF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6454629/6463978/06464008.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOF.2012.6464008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive behavior analysis framework for fault prediction in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464008/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive behavior analysis framework for fault prediction in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13327285","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464008/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive behavior analysis framework for fault prediction in cloud computing","confLoc":"Tunis, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p146farrahimoghaddam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.227514S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6454629","isNumber":"6463978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6463978","articleId":"6464008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464011,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Khoshnevis","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Khoshnevis","id":"38548275700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5265-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5263-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5264-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6464011","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Feature extraction","Detectors","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot signature based detection","DVB-T2 broadcasting signal recognition","Federal Communication Commission","spectrum allocation","telecommunication systems","spectrum holes","cognitive radio systems","cyclostationary based detection algorithm","signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Sensing","Cyclostationary Based Detection","DVB-T2","Scattered Pilots"]}],"abstract":"According to the Federal Communication Commission, spectrum allocation will be one of the problems of future telecommunication systems.

Several numerical methods have already been developed and applied to analyze piezoelectric PCs, most of them have various disadvantages, as they cannot calculate the transmission characteristic of the limited structure or cannot provide the propagation process for SAW in time domain. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique solving these problems is adopted to analyze the piezoelectric characteristics of PCs. Propagation in the PCs is studies by experience with direct generation and detection of SAW using interdigital transducers (IDT's). The simulation data agrees with the measurement data.

However, the performance of conventional high-resolution DOA estimation methods is influenced because of the neglect of some important factors, such as effect of underwater sound channel, the array position errors and so on. In order to improve the robustness of the high-resolution DOA estimation methods, the vector optimization robust beamforming method is realized by adding a strong joint constraint to the weight vector norm and the steering vector errors. In addition, simulating the matched-field processing method, the DOA estimation of underwater moving targets can be computed by combining adaptive robust beamforming and normal-mode theory. It is shown that the adaptive beamforming which is presented in this paper has higher peak to maximum sidelobe ratio (PSR) and narrower ~3dB beamwidth.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWDA.2012.6464060","pdfPath":"/iel7/6449392/6464012/06464060.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"162","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Piezoelectricity, Acoustic Waves, and Device Applications (SPAWDA)","publicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Piezoelectricity, Acoustic Waves, and Device Applications (SPAWDA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWDA.2012.6464060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation of the moving targets in shallow water based on vector optimization beamforming and normal-mode theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation of the moving targets in shallow water based on vector optimization beamforming and normal-mode theory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13327160","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6464060/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation of the moving targets in shallow water based on vector optimization beamforming and normal-mode theory","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08329S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449392","isNumber":"6464012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6464012","articleId":"6464060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464140,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhao Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yuhao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468699900"},{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275013000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-1671-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"6464140","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464140","abstract":"Topological insulator (TI) is recently discovered nano-device whose bulk acts as insulator but surface behaves as metal. As state information in a TI device is conducted by ordered spins, it draws tremendous interest for ultra-low power computing. This paper shows a state-space modeling and design exploration of TI device for non-volatile memory (NVM) design. The non-traditional electrical state in TI is extracted and modeled in a SPICE-like simulator. The model is the employed for hybrid CMOS-TI NVM design explorations for both memory cell and memory array. The experiment results show that TI based NVM exhibits a fast write and read latency as low as 20ns. In addition, compared to other emerging NVM technologies, it exhibits several orders of magnitude lower operation energy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464140.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design exploration of ultra-low power non-volatile memory based on topological insulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Magnetization","Saturation magnetization","Mathematical model","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Magnetic anisotropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit modelling","low-power electronics","nanoelectronics","random-access storage","topological insulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultralow power nonvolatile memory","topological insulator","nanodevice","ordered spins","ultralow power computing","state-space modeling","nontraditional electrical state","SPICE-like simulator","hybrid CMOS-TI NVM design explorations","memory cell","memory array","fast write","read latency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design exploration of ultra-low power non-volatile memory based on topological insulator","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13370365","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6464140/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464140/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design exploration of ultra-low power non-volatile memory based on topological insulator","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP06105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061187S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464141,"authors":[{"name":"Moein Kianpour","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Moein","lastName":"Kianpour","id":"38279980600"},{"name":"Reza Sabbaghi-Nadooshan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Sabbaghi-Nadooshan","id":"38547652400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-1671-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"6464141","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Decoding","Table lookup","Clocks","Multiplexing","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","field programmable gate arrays","logic gates","quantum dots","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","principal standard configurable logic block","CLB implementation","quantum-dot cellular automata","QCA","nanotechnology","single electron effects","quantum molecules","look-up table","read write operation","decoders","multiplexers","five-input majority gates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Configurable Logic Block (CLB)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Look-Up Table (LUT)","Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)","Multiplexer"]}],"abstract":"Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a promising, emerging nanotechnology based on single electron effects in quantum dots and molecules.

The proposed macromodel (consisting of two models) generates the I-V and R-I plots of a PCM cell at a very small error compared with experimental data. The electrical-based modeling by HSPICE allows to fully characterize the holding voltage and the continuous behavior of the PCM resistance, while assessing the impact of the programming time. Furthermore, the proposed model takes into account the drift behavior of few parameters when the PCM is not been programmed or read, making the model more realistic. Selection of the parameters is based on operational features, so the electrical characterization of the PCM is simple, easy to simulate and intuitive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6464147/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13370372","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Macromodeling a phase change memory (PCM) cell by HSPICE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macromodeling a phase change memory (PCM) cell by HSPICE","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP13103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130205S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464148,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

However the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory cell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large enough to ensure enough current for the switching operation. This paper describes a design of crossbar architecture based on 2R complementary resistive switching memory cell. This architecture allows fewer selection transistors, and minimum contacts between memory cells and CMOS control circuits. The complementary cell and parallel data sensing mitigate the impact of sneak currents in the crossbar architecture.

They range from healthcare to video surveillance. As the number of applications and their associated performance requirements grow rapidly, more and more powerful, flexible and power efficient computing units are necessary. In such a context, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) architectures present a good trade-off between performance and flexibility. However, they consume high static power and can hardly be associated with power gating techniques due to their long context restoring phase. In this paper, we propose to integrate non-volatile resistive memories in configuration cells in order to instantly restore the FPGA context. We then show that if the circuit is in `ON' state for less than 42% of time, non-volatile FPGA starts saving energy compared to classical FPGA. Finally, for a typical application with only 1% of time spent in `ON' state, the energy gain reaches 50%.","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765510","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464150.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRAM-based FPGA for \u201cnormally off, instantly on\u201d applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"RRAM-based FPGA for \u201cnormally off, instantly on\u201d applications","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6464150/","accessionNumber":"13370375","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRAM-based FPGA for \u201cnormally off, instantly on\u201d applications","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP16128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064338S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6464151,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37717196800"},{"name":"Sorin D.

The model build upon an extension of the reaction-diffusion theory such that it can cover the natural variations encountered in nanoscale MOSFET circuits. Dynamic NBTI stress on SRAM cells is modeled by using stochastic input signals. A mitigation technology for minimizing the NBTI aging is also demonstrated by taking advantage of the independent-gate FinFET device structure using threshold voltage adjustment.

We consider a 3D stacked processor executing independent instruction streams from different threads, on each die. We propose the vertical clustering of functionally identical computational blocks in order to enable the utilization of the 3D specific low-latency interlayer communication infrastructure. The clustering facilitates the parallel re-execution of instructions on idle units located in the proximity of the units which initially computed them and in this way creates the means for fault diagnosis and detection. We detail the control, interconnection communication infrastructure, instruction distribution, and results processing policies required for our scheme. To determine the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate its performance in terms of diagnosis latency and percentage of verified operations on 3 to 8 core processors implemented on 3 to 8 tier 3D-SICs, respectively, by means of simulations. Our experiments indicate that the diagnosis latency ranges from 9 to 5 cycles, for 3 to 8 cores, respectively. For transient fault detection our simulations indicate that 86% to 94% of all executed instructions are verified, for 3 to 8 cores, respectively. When only one of the layers is protected against transient faults the number of verified operations increases to 94% to 99%, for the same simulation conditions. This suggests that, if certain conditions are fulfilled at design time, our approach can completely protect one instruction stream identified as being critical for the application. Our simulations clearly indicate that the proposed scheme has the potential to improve the 3D stacked integrated circuits dependability with no performance overhead and at the expense of little area overhead.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Reliability","Transient analysis","Fault detection","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","integrated circuit interconnections","microprocessor chips","performance evaluation","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-performance-overhead online fault detection and diagnosis","vertical proximity","3D-SIC","3D stacked processor","instruction streams","vertical clustering","functionally identical computational blocks","3D specific low-latency interlayer communication infrastructure","parallel re-execution","interconnection communication infrastructure","instruction distribution","results processing policy","performance evaluation","diagnosis latency","core processors","transient fault detection","3D stacked integrated circuits dependability","performance overhead"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464153","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765514","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464153.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765514","startPage":"123","endPage":"130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-performance-overhead online fault detection and diagnosis in 3D stacked integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero-performance-overhead online fault detection and diagnosis in 3D stacked integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13370378","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-performance-overhead online fault detection and diagnosis in 3D stacked integrated circuits","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP19144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058948S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6464153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6464157,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Sakode","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Sakode","id":"38546982300"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-1671-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"6464157","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Resistance","CMOS integrated circuits","Films","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","DRAM chips","memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell design","comparative evaluation","1T memristor-based memory","post-CMOS component","Semiconductor Industry Technology Roadmap","memory design","voltage degradation","linear array size","cell parameters","DRAM cell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","DAC","nanotechnology","DRAM","flux/charge"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464157","abstract":"CMOS is expected to soon meet the end of the Semiconductor Industry Technology Roadmap.

There are still major concerns, for instance, about maximum achievable device density, or about which architecture is best fit for a specific application. Growing complexity requires taking into account many aspects of technology, application and architecture at the same time. Researchers face problems that are not new per se, but are now subject to very different constraints, that need to be captured by design tools. Among the emerging nanotechnologies, two-dimensional nanowire based arrays represent promising nanostructures, especially for massively parallel computing architectures. Few attempts have been done, aimed at giving the possibility to explore architectural solutions, deriving information from extensive and reliable nanoarray characterization. Moreover, in the nanotechnology arena there is still not a clear winner, so it is important to be able to target different technologies, not to miss the next big thing. We present a tool, ToPoliNano, that enables such a multi-technological characterization in terms of logic behavior, power and timing performance, area and layout constraints, on the basis of specific technological and topological descriptions. This tool can aid the design process, beside providing a comprehensive simulation framework for DC and timing simulations, and detailed power analysis.

With system simulation, the efficiency of this scheme is evidenced in terms of recognition rate on the textbook case of character recognition. Simulations also show its extreme robustness to device variations. Second, we present a supervised architecture that can learn if the classification of every input is given. Simulations prove its efficiency. A good robustness to device variation is seen, but not to the level of the unsupervised approach. Finally, we show that both approaches can be combined, with variation robustness higher than in the supervised case. This opens important prospects, like the possibility to first train the system in an unsupervised way with unlabeled data, while still benefiting of the simplicity to program a supervised system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464164.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bioinspired networks with nanoscale memristive devices that combine the unsupervised and supervised learning approaches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Nanoscale devices","Robustness","Mathematical model","Training","Supervised learning","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","memristors","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","spike timing dependent plasticity","memristive nanodevices","learning architectures","unsupervised learning","nanoscale memristive devices","bioinspired networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristive devices","unsupervised learning","supervised learning","learning architecture","device variations","synapses","neuroinspired systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bioinspired networks with nanoscale memristive devices that combine the unsupervised and supervised learning approaches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464164/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13370389","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bioinspired networks with nanoscale memristive devices that combine the unsupervised and supervised learning approaches","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP30143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106512S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6464165,"authors":[{"name":"Mrigank Sharad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mrigank","lastName":"Sharad","id":"37845785900"},{"name":"Charles Augustine","affiliation":["Circuit Research Laboratory, Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Augustine","id":"37392520200"},{"name":"Georgios Panagopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Panagopoulos","id":"37605563000"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-1671-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"6464165","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetic tunneling","Mathematical model","Computer architecture","Clocks","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","nanomagnetics","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra low energy analog image processing","spin based neurons","cellular network","lateral spin valve","multiple input magnets","duty-cycle system-clock","analog-mode processing","nanomagnets","processing schemes","mixed-signal image acquisition","computation energy","magnitude reduction","leakage power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","spin","magnets","data processing","low power","analog"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present an ultra low energy, `on-sensor' image processing architecture, based on cellular network of spin based neurons. The `neuron' constitutes of a lateral spin valve (LSV) with multiple input magnets, connected to an output magnet, using metal channels. The low resistance, magneto-metallic neurons operate at a small terminal voltage of ~20mV, while performing analog computation upon photo sensor inputs. The static current-flow across the device terminals is limited to small periods, corresponding to magnet switching time, and, is determined by a low duty-cycle system-clock. Thus, the energy-cost of analog-mode processing, inevitable in most image sensing applications, is reduced and made comparable to that of dynamic and leakage power consumption in peripheral CMOS units. Performance of the proposed architecture for some common image sensing and processing applications like, feature extraction, halftone compression and digitization, have been obtained through physics based device simulation framework, coupled with SPICE. Results indicate that the proposed design scheme can achieve more than two orders of magnitude reduction in computation energy, as compared to the state of art CMOS designs, that are based on conventional mixed-signal image acquisition and processing schemes. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work where application of nano magnets (in LSV's) in analog signal processing has been proposed.","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765529","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464165.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra low energy analog image processing using spin based neurons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464165/","displayDocTitle":"Ultra low energy analog image processing using spin based neurons","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13370390","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464165/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra low energy analog image processing using spin based neurons","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP31146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107987S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464166,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Soltiz","affiliation":["NanoComputing Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Soltiz","id":"38546885200"},{"name":"Cory Merkel","affiliation":["NanoComputing Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cory","lastName":"Merkel","id":"37888574000"},{"name":"Dhireesha Kudithipudi","affiliation":["NanoComputing Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dhireesha","lastName":"Kudithipudi","id":"37282444800"},{"name":"Garrett S.

Due to their functional similarities to synapses in the brain, memristors are becoming a key element in the hardware realization of Hebbian Learning systems. By pairing such devices and a perceptron-based neuron model with a threshold activation function, previous work has shown that a neural logic block capable of learning any linearly separable function in real-time can be developed. However, in this configuration, any function with two or more decision boundaries cannot be learned in a single layer. While previous memristor-based neural logic block designs have proven to achieve very low area and high performance when compared to Look-Up Tables (LUT) and Capacitive Threshold Logic (CTL), the limitation on the set of learnable functions has made networks of these logic blocks impractical to scale to realistic applications. By integrating an additional layer of memristors into a neural logic block, this paper proposes a logic block with an adaptive activation function. The resulting logic block is capable of learning any function in a single layer, reducing the number of logic blocks required to implement a single 4-input function by up to 10 and significantly improving training time. When considered as a building block for ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, the proposed logic block is capable of achieving an Energy-Delay Product (EDP) up to 97.8% lower than a neural logic block with a threshold activation function. Furthermore, the performance improvement over a CMOS LUT implementation ranges from 78.08% to 97.43% for all ISCAS-85 circuits.","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765530","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464166.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRAM-based adaptive neural logic block for implementing non-linearly separable functions in a single layer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RRAM-based adaptive neural logic block for implementing non-linearly separable functions in a single layer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13370391","publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464166/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464166/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRAM-based adaptive neural logic block for implementing non-linearly separable functions in a single layer","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP32109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05374S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457543","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6464134","articleId":"6464166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6464167,"authors":[{"name":"Manjari S.

Reservoir computing (RC) is a new computing paradigm that allows to harness the intrinsic dynamics of a \u201creservoir\u201d to perform useful computations. The reservoir, or compute core, must only provide sufficiently rich dynamics that are then mapped onto a low-dimensional space by an readout layer. One of the key advantages of this approach is that only the readout layer needs to be adapted to perform the desired computation. The reservoir itself remains unchanged. In this paper we use for the first time memristive components as reservoir building blocks that are assembled into device networks. Memristive components are particularly interesting for this purpose because of their non-linear and memory characteristics. In addition, they can be integrated very densely and provide rich dynamics with a few components only. We use pattern recognition and associative memory tasks to illustrate the memristive reservoir computing approach. For that purpose, we have built a software framework that allows to create valid memristor networks, to simulate and evaluate them in Ngspice, and to train the readout layer by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results show that we can efficiently and robustly classify temporal patterns. The approach presents a promising new computing paradigm that harnesses the non-linear, time-dependent, and highly-variable properties of current memristive components for solving computational tasks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464134","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457543/6464134/06464167.pdf","doi":"10.1145/2765491.2765531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765531","startPage":"226","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor-based reservoir computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464167/","displayDocTitle":"Memristor-based reservoir computing","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13370392","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","publicationDate":"July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor-based reservoir computing","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"RP33106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054738S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","isNumber":"6464134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457543","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6464167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6464267,"authors":[{"name":"Dola Saha","affiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6971280/6464267/saha-24-small.gif","p":["Dola Saha received the master\u2019s degree in computer science with the University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.

While accurate rate estimation yields better rate-selection decisions and increased throughput, those methods must still choose between a handful of modulation rates. Each modulation rate is effective in a range of actual signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) but the limited number of practical rates means that transmitters are often forced to \u201cstep down\u201d to a lower data rate despite having a higher SNR than the minimum required for that lower rate. In this paper we describe, evaluate and implement a practical multiuser communication scheme that exploits these discrete \u201csteps\u201d in modulation rates to transmit two packets in the time normally needed to transmit a single packet, increasing aggregate throughput precisely when it is most needed-when the network is busy and suffers from rate unfairness. Because the method transmits a group of packets simultaneously, we call this scheme Group Rate Transmission with Intertwined Symbols, or GRaTIS. In addition to up to 120% improvement in network throughput achieved by GRaTIS, the technique is backward compatible with 802.11 and doesn't require complex DSP algorithms as required by competing methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6971280/06464267.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"85","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRaTIS: Free Bits in the Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"GRaTIS: Free Bits in the Network","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6464267/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14789246","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRaTIS: Free Bits in the Network","sourcePdf":"tmc-saha-24-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104114S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6971280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6971280","articleId":"6464267","onlineDate":"19 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6464470,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We address these problems by the use of graphical argumentation techniques. In particular, we show how the Goal Structuring Notations (GSN) can be extended from applications in safetycritical systems. Security arguments presented with GSN can help managers to reason about cyber-security policies and procedures by bringing together claims and the evidence that supports them in a structured and coherent way. A further objective of this paper is to show how GSN can be used to construct security arguments that are informed by the analysis of previous security incidents in healthcare organisations. In particular, we present two generic security cases that embody the recommendations from incidents involving the United States' Veterans' Affairs (VA) administration and Shenzhen Hospital in China. These case studies were deliberately chosen to show how lessons learned in one country might inform security management in other healthcare systems. We also show that security cases can be created at a level of abstraction that support reuses and at the same time capture detailed recommendations from security incidents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464470/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13255471","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generic security cases for information system security in healthcare systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic security cases for information system security in healthcare systems","confLoc":"Edinburgh","sourcePdf":"20121507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036757S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","isNumber":"6494528","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6485038","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6464470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6464471,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

Our results indicate that increasing the constellation size uniformly for all subcarriers does not decrease the outage capacity.

Through the analysis, exact and approximate outage probability are derived based on which the diversity order and coding gain are obtained. Our findings suggest that the diversity order linearly increases with the number of relays and decreases with the order of the relay. Furthermore, results reveal that the system is still able to achieve full diversity gain in the presence of finite number of interferers with finite powers.

Using the phase compensation technique, the proposed VGA can provide appropriate gain tuning with almost constant phase characteristics, thus greatly reducing the phase-tuning complexity in a phased-array system. The measured root mean square (rms) phase error of the 5-bit phase shifter is 2\u00b0 at 62 GHz. The phase shifter has a low group-delay deviation (phase distortion) of +/- 8.5 ps and an excellent insertion loss flatness of \u00b10.8 dB for a specific phase-shifting state, across 57-64 GHz. For all 32 states, the insertion loss is 14.6 \u00b1 3 dB, including pad loss at 60 GHz. For the integrated phase shifter and VGA, the VGA can provide 6.2-dB gain tuning range, which is wide enough to cover the loss variation of the phase shifter, with only 1.86\u00b0 phase variation. The measured rms phase error of the 5-bit phase shifter and VGA is 3.8\u00b0 at 63 GHz. The insertion loss of all 32 states is 5.4 dB, including pad loss at 60 GHz, and the loss flatness is \u00b10.8 dB over 57-64 GHz.

Demand response management (DRM) is recognized as a control unit of the smart grid, with the attempt to balance the real-time load as well as to shift the peak-hour load. Communications are critical to the accuracy and optimality of DRM, and hence at the core of the control performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we introduce cognitive radio into the smart grid to improve the communication quality. By means of spectrum sensing and channel switching, smart meters can decide to transmit data on either an original unlicensed channel or an additional licensed channel, so as to reduce the communication outage. Considering the energy cost taxed by spectrum sensing together with the control performance degradation incurred by imperfect communications, we formulate the sensing-performance tradeoff problem between better control performance and lower communication cost, paving the way towards a green smart grid. The impact of the communication outage on the control performance of DRM is also analyzed, which reduces the profit of power provider and the social welfare of the smart grid, although it may not always decrease the profit of power consumer. By employing the energy detector, we prove that there exists a unique optimal sensing time which yields the maximum tradeoff revenue, under the constraint that the licensed channel is sufficiently protected. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing-Performance Tradeoff in Cognitive Radio Enabled Smart Grid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2210058","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6471805/06464545.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2210058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Sensing-Performance Tradeoff in Cognitive Radio Enabled Smart Grid","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6464545/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355393","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing-Performance Tradeoff in Cognitive Radio Enabled Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-chen-2210058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104683S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6464545","onlineDate":"19 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6464552,"authors":[{"name":"Sabita Maharjan","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6464552/6464552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sabita Maharjan received her B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal, and the M.E. degree from Antenna and Propagation Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

However, it has been an open issue to address the DRM problem in a network of multiple utility companies and consumers where every entity is concerned about maximizing its own benefit. In this paper, we propose a Stackelberg game between utility companies and end-users to maximize the revenue of each utility company and the payoff of each user. We derive analytical results for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game and prove that a unique solution exists. We develop a distributed algorithm which converges to the equilibrium with only local information available for both utility companies and end-users. Though DRM helps to facilitate the reliability of power supply, the smart grid can be succeptible to privacy and security issues because of communication links between the utility companies and the consumers. We study the impact of an attacker who can manipulate the price information from the utility companies. We also propose a scheme based on the concept of shared reserve power to improve the grid reliability and ensure its dependability.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2223766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6471805/06464552.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2223766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependable Demand Response Management in the Smart Grid: A Stackelberg Game Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Dependable Demand Response Management in the Smart Grid: A Stackelberg Game Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464552/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13355394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464552/","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependable Demand Response Management in the Smart Grid: A Stackelberg Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tsg-maharjan-2223766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077868S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"441","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6464552","onlineDate":"19 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6464562,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-\u00c9tienne L\u00e9vy","affiliation":["Systemes et Applications des Technologies de l'Information et de l'Energie Laboratory, Cachan, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6627992/6464562/6464562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pierre-\u00c9tienne L\u00e9vy was born in France in 1988.

Among them, coils with ferromagnetic cores belong to the class of components that are used the most. However the behavior in terms of radiation and coupling to the environment of these components is not widely explored. This paper defines a more accurate model for coils with toroidal ferrite cores in order to get a better understanding of the coupling they created. Then the effects of the winding layout around a toroidal core are first discussed. It is found that the winding topology is the major parameter controlling both the radiated field pattern and its magnitude. A measurement bench has then been developed to validate the hypothesis made. Finally, numerical and analytic models have been elaborated to predict radiated fields from magnetic components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered

disease that leads to vision loss. As it cannot be cured, detecting the disease in time is important. Current tests using intraocular pressure (IOP) are not sensitive enough for population based glaucoma screening. Optic nerve head assessment in retinal fundus images is both more promising and superior. This paper proposes optic disc and optic cup segmentation using superpixel classification for glaucoma screening. In optic disc segmentation, histograms, and center surround statistics are used to classify each superpixel as disc or non-disc. A self-assessment reliability score is computed to evaluate the quality of the automated optic disc segmentation. For optic cup segmentation, in addition to the histograms and center surround statistics, the location information is also included into the feature space to boost the performance. The proposed segmentation methods have been evaluated in a database of 650 images with optic disc and optic cup boundaries manually marked by trained professionals. Experimental results show an average overlapping error of 9.5% and 24.1% in optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively. The results also show an increase in overlapping error as the reliability score is reduced, which justifies the effectiveness of the self-assessment. The segmented optic disc and optic cup are then used to compute the cup to disc ratio for glaucoma screening. Our proposed method achieves areas under curve of 0.800 and 0.822 in two data sets, which is higher than other methods. The methods can be used for segmentation and glaucoma screening. The self-assessment will be used as an indicator of cases with large errors and enhance the clinical deployment of the automatic segmentation and screening.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superpixel Classification Based Optic Disc and Optic Cup Segmentation for Glaucoma Screening","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2247770","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6521429/06464593.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2247770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Superpixel Classification Based Optic Disc and Optic Cup Segmentation for Glaucoma Screening","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6464593/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13529243","pubMedId":"23434609","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superpixel Classification Based Optic Disc and Optic Cup Segmentation for Glaucoma Screening","sourcePdf":"tmi-cheng-2247770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142978S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6521429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"315","xplore-issue":"6521429","articleId":"6464593","onlineDate":"19 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6464608,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Mu\u00f1oz","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of M\u00e1laga, Malaga, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6530672/6464608/6464608-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Mu\u00f1oz received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of M\u00e1laga, M\u00e1laga, Spain, in 2008.

One of the use cases defined in this field is the optimization of the handover (HO) process, which involves a tradeoff between the amount of signaling load due to HOs and the quality of the active connections in the network. In this paper, first, a sensitivity analysis of the two main HO parameters, i.e., the HO margin (HOM) and the time-to-trigger (TTT), is carried out for different system load levels and user speeds in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Second, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that adaptively modifies HOMs is designed for HO optimization. In this case, different parameter optimization levels (network-wide, cell-wide, and cell-pair-wide) and the impact of measurement errors have been considered. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that tuning HOMs is an effective solution for HO optimization in LTE networks. In addition, the FLC is shown as an effective technique to adapt HOM to different network conditions so that the signaling load in the network is decreased while an admissible level of call dropping is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2247778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6530672/06464608.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2247778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Potential of Handover Parameter Optimization for Self-Organizing Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464608/","displayDocTitle":"On the Potential of Handover Parameter Optimization for Self-Organizing Networks","volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2013","accessionNumber":"13563768","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464608/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Potential of Handover Parameter Optimization for Self-Organizing Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-munozluengo-2247778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103733S","chronDate":"Jun  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6530672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6530672","articleId":"6464608","onlineDate":"19 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6464609,"authors":[{"name":"Will X.

However, the out-of-band (OOB) radiation of OFDM signals from different CR users must be strictly controlled to protect licensed users operating in the adjacent frequency bands. In this paper, we propose a spectral precoding approach for multiple OFDM-based CR users to reduce OOB leakage and enhance spectrum compactness. By constructing individual precoders to render selected spectrum nulls, our approach suppresses the overall OOB radiation without sacrificing bit-error rate performance of CR users. The proposed approach also ensures user independence thus with low encoding and decoding complexities. Furthermore, our approach can improve bandwidth efficiency by carefully selecting notched frequencies. As a comprehensive application of the proposed approach, two simplified multiuser spectral precoding schemes are provided to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our spectral precoding schemes effectively limit OOB radiation and enable efficient spectrum sharing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464628.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Spectral Precoding for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Decoding","Receivers","Frequency division multiplexing","Bandwidth","Encoding","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser spectral precoding approach","OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","CR systems","dynamic spectrum access","out-of-band radiation","OOB radiation","OFDM signals","adjacent frequency bands","selected spectrum nulls","decoding complexity","computational complexity","spectrum sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","out-of-band radiation","spectral precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Spectral Precoding for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6464628/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342659","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Spectral Precoding for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"345jsac0313zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117105S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464629,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Yonghong Zeng received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree from National University of Defense Technology, China.

Thus the detection of OFDM signals is of significant importance in cognitive radio and other spectrum sharing systems. A common feature of OFDM in many popular standards is that some pilot subcarriers repeat periodically after certain OFDM blocks. In this paper, sensing methods for OFDM signals are proposed by using such repetition structure of the pilots. Firstly, special properties for the auto-correlation (AC) of the received signals are identified, from which the optimal likelihood ratio test (LRT) is derived. However, this method requires the knowledge of channel information, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and noise power. To make the LRT method practical, we then propose an approximated LRT (ALRT) method that does not rely on the channel information and noise power, thus the CFO is the only remaining obstacle to the ALRT. To handle the problem, we propose a method to estimate the composite CFO and compensate its effect in the AC using multiple taps of ACs of the received signals. Computer simulations have shown that the proposed sensing methods are robust to frequency offset, noise power uncertainty, time delay uncertainty, and frequency selectiveness of the channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464629/","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6464629/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13342660","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Signals Using Pilot Induced Auto-Correlations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Signals Using Pilot Induced Auto-Correlations","sourcePdf":"353jsac0313zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094783S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464631,"authors":[{"name":"Caili Guo","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence and School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464631/6464631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Caili Guo received the Ph.D. degree in Communication and Information Systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication (BUPT), Beijing, China.

Nevertheless, interference may be introduced to the Primary User (PU) when the Secondary Users (SUs) dynamically utilize the PU's licensed channels. If the SUs can be synchronous with the PU's time slots, the interference is mainly due to their imperfect spectrum sensing of the primary channel. However, if the SUs have no knowledge about the PU's exact communication mechanism, additional interference may occur. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spectrum access protocol for the SUs confronting with unknown primary behavior and study the interference caused by their dynamic access. Through analyzing the SUs' dynamic behavior in the primary channel which is modeled as an ON-OFF process, we prove that the SUs' communication behavior is a renewal process. Based on the Renewal Theory, we quantify the interference caused by the SUs and derive the corresponding closed-form expressions. With the interference analysis, we study how to optimize the SUs' performance under the constraints of the PU's communication quality of service (QoS) and the secondary network's stability.

We address the natural questions that arise when the incumbents or primary users (PUs) return to the channel the SUs are using opportunistically. Instead of immediately switching to another idle channel as proposed in almost all existing approaches, the SUs may opt to wait silently in their current channel until the PUs depart. This option would be beneficial to the SUs if the returned PUs stay at the channel only for a short period of time and the SUs' channel-switching incurs a non-negligible overhead. We determine how long the SUs should wait in their current channel before switching to a new idle channel. The SUs should also occasionally sense those (called em out-of-band) channels currently not in use for sensing the availability of spectrum opportunities. We propose an efficient, adaptive spectrum-sensing technique to detect when a busy out-of-band channel becomes idle. We also present a spectrum-management architecture that integrates the SUs' strategies and facilitates fast discovery of spectrum opportunities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13342664","htmlLink":"/document/6464634/","displayDocTitle":"What Should Secondary Users Do Upon Incumbents' Return?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Should Secondary Users Do Upon Incumbents' Return?","sourcePdf":"417jsac0313zhang1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073313S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464635,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598591200"},{"name":"Hai Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272625900"},{"name":"Peng Tan","affiliation":["TELUS Communications Company, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37271340300"},{"name":"Jim Slevinsky","affiliation":["TELUS Communications Company, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Slevinsky","id":"37844064400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"6464635","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":984},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Vectors","Indexes","Cognitive radio","Channel estimation","Benchmark testing","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel exploration","channel exploitation","imperfect spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","opportunistic channel sensing problem","user statistical information","learning loss","busy-idle state","channel access process","side observation","channel sensing process","bilevel multiarmed bandit problem","least logarithmic regret"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","opportunistic channel access","bandit problem","channel exploration","channel exploitation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem of opportunistic channel sensing and access in cognitive radio networks when the sensing is imperfect and a secondary user can access up to a limited number of channels at a time is investigated. Primary users' statistical information is assumed to be unknown, and therefore, a secondary user needs to learn the information online during channel sensing and access process, which means learning loss, also referred to as regret, is inevitable. For each channel, the busy/idle state is independent from one slot to another. In this research, the case when all potential channels can be sensed simultaneously is investigated first. The channel access process is modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem with side observation. And channel access rules are derived and theoretically proved to have asymptotically finite regret. Then the case when the secondary user can sense only a limited number of channels at a time is investigated. The channel sensing and access process is modeled as a bi-level multi-armed bandit problem. It is shown that any adaptive rule has at least logarithmic regret. Then we derive channel sensing and access rules and theoretically prove that they have logarithmic regret asymptotically and with finite time. The case when the busy/idle states of a channel are correlated over slots is also investigated. And a channel sensing and access rule with logarithmic regret is derived. The effectiveness of the derived rules is validated by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130309","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464635.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"429","endPage":"441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Exploration and Exploitation with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel Exploration and Exploitation with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464635/","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6464635/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342665","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Exploration and Exploitation with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"429jsac0313zhang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131082S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464636,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan E.

Given the increased agility of a transceiver's frequency assignment, the network topology can be optimized to address end-to-end networking goals. We propose a channel assignment scheme for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) that balances the need for topology adaptation focusing on flow rate maximization and the need for a stable baseline topology that supports network connectivity. We focus on CRNs in which nodes are equipped with multiple radios or transceivers, each of which can be assigned to a channel. First, our approach assigns channels independently of traffic, to achieve basic network connectivity and support light loads such as control traffic, and second, it dynamically assigns channels to the remaining transceivers in response to traffic demand. In this paper, we focus on the traffic-independent (TI) channel assignment with the goal of dedicating as few transceivers as possible to achieving baseline connectivity. By conserving transceivers in the TI assignment, the network is more able to adapt to any traffic demands in a subsequent traffic-driven (TD) assignment. We formulate the problem as a two-stage mixed integer linear program (MILP), with a TI stage and a TD stage. We propose a centralized greedy approach to TI assignment which performs nearly identically to the optimum obtained from the two-stage MILP in terms of the number of transceivers assigned and flow rate in the evaluated scenarios. Subsequently, we propose a distributed greedy TI approach that performs within 9% of the optimum in terms of the number of transceivers assigned and within 1.5% of the optimum in terms of flow rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","volume":"31","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13342666","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464636/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource-Minimized Channel Assignment for Multi-Transceiver Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource-Minimized Channel Assignment for Multi-Transceiver Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"442jsac0313irwin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059125S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464637,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia Tachwali","affiliation":["Agilent Technologies, West lake, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464637/6464637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yahia Tachwali is an R&D Engineer at Agilent Technologies.

The spectral access of the cognitive radio network is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). A joint bandwidth and power allocation is performed so that users' rate requirements are satisfied, and the integrity of primary user communication is preserved. In this work, two unique challenges are addressed. The first is the incorporation of primary user activity in the design of resource allocation technique, and the second is the limited hardware capabilities of cognitive terminals compared to those available at the cognitive base station. To address these problems, a novel resource allocation framework is proposed based on the bandwidth-power product minimization, which is an effective metric in evaluating the spectral resource consumption in a cognitive radio environment. The framework takes into consideration the challenges aforementioned. The results show significant enhancement in spectral efficiency by using our framework compared to classical power adaptive optimization using iterative waterfilling scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","startPage":"451","endPage":"463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Resource Allocation Optimization Using Bandwidth-Power Product in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Resource Allocation Optimization Using Bandwidth-Power Product in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342667","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6464637/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Resource Allocation Optimization Using Bandwidth-Power Product in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"451jsac0313tachwali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151022S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464638,"authors":[{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464638/6464638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaowei Wang (S'06-M'07) received the BS, MS and PhD degrees in electronic engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 1997, 2003, and 2006, respectively (with honors).

We propose to address this hard task in two steps. For the first step, we perform subchannel allocation to satisfy heterogeneous users' rate requirements roughly and remove the intractable integer constraints of the optimization problem. For the second step, we perform power distribution among the OFDM subchannels. By exploiting the problem structure to speedup the Newton step, we propose a barrier-based method which is able to achieve the optimal power distribution with an almost linear complexity, significantly better than the complexity of standard techniques. Moreover, we propose a method which is able to approximate the optimal solution with a constant complexity. Numerical results validate that our proposal exploits the overall capacity of CR systems well subjected to different traffic demands of users and interference constraints with given power budget.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464638.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342668","htmlLink":"/document/6464638/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"464jsac0313wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124738S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464639,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Chi Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Google, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464639/6464639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jui-Chi Liang received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011.

However, cognitive radio also brings new challenges in the design of future wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation in cognitive radio networks. Specifically, we consider the problem of proportional fair scheduling in cognitive radio relay networks. Our problem formulation takes into account the fluctuations of usable spectrum resource, channel quality variations caused by frequency selectivity, and interference caused by different transmit power levels. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and is computationally infeasible to be solved in a timely manner by using brute force algorithms. An easy-to-compute upper bound for the formulated problem is also derived. We then propose two heuristic algorithms that are easy-to-implement, yet achieve performance close to the upper bound. The proposed algorithms can be executed and finished within 1 millisecond. Thus, they can meet the requirement of real-time scheduling. Simulation experiments verify that the proposed algorithms can achieve good proportional fairness among users and enhance system throughput by proper power control.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","startPage":"476","endPage":"488","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464639.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6464639/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Relay Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342669","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"476jsac0313liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104461S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464641,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zheng","affiliation":["College of Science and Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464641/6464641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Zheng received the Bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

All the users maximize the network utility by adapting their signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) assignment and transmit power subject to power budget constraints and additional interference temperature constraint for the secondary users. The utility maximization problem is challenging to solve optimally in a distributed manner due to the nonconvexity and the tight coupling between the power budget and interference temperature constraint sets. We first study a special case where egalitarian SINR fairness is the utility, and a tuning-free distributed algorithm with a geometric convergence rate is developed to solve it optimally. Then, we answer the general utility maximization question by developing a cognitive radio network duality to decouple the SINR assignment, the transmit power and the interference temperature allocation. This leads to a utility maximization algorithm that leverages the egalitarian fairness power control as a submodule to maintain a desirable separability in the SINR assignment between the secondary and primary users. This algorithm has the advantage that it can be distributively implemented, and the method converges relatively fast. Numerical results are presented to show that our proposed algorithms are theoretically sound and practically implementable.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464641.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Network Duality and Algorithms for Utility Maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Network Duality and Algorithms for Utility Maximization","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342679","htmlLink":"/document/6464641/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Network Duality and Algorithms for Utility Maximization","sourcePdf":"500jsac0313zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101404S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464642,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Broadband Wirless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464642/6464642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2003 and the M.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. Johns, NL, Canada, in 2008.

This paper provides an asymptotic analysis of the steady-state queue length distribution of secondary users (SUs) under the heavy tailed network environment. Specifically, two network scenarios are investigated. In the first scenario where each SU has its exclusive access to a primary user (PU) channel, it is shown that the heavy tailed nature of either the PU traffic or the SU traffic can make SUs experience heavy tailed queue length with unbounded moments. In the second scenario where multiple SUs share a single PU channel, the queuing performance under throughput optimal scheduling policies is studied. It is proven that if the PU traffic has a heavier tail than any SU traffic, the queue length of each SU is at least one order heavier than the PU traffic under any scheduling policy. Otherwise, if the traffic from at least one of the SUs has a heavier tail than the PU traffic, it is proven that the celebrated throughput-optimal maximum weight scheduling leads to the worst possible asymptotic queuing performance for SUs by letting each SU queue have the heaviest possible tail. On the contrary, it is shown that there always exists a feasible set of \u03b2 parameters such that the maximum weight-\u03b2 scheduling yields the best asymptotic performance for the SU queues by letting each queue have the lightest possible tail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13342670","htmlLink":"/document/6464642/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Queuing Analysis for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks in the Presence of Heavy Tails","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Queuing Analysis for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks in the Presence of Heavy Tails","sourcePdf":"514jsac0313wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106234S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6464643,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Fanous","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464643/6464643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anthony Fanous (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Egypt in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include cognitive radio networks and cross-layer design of wireless networks with focus on cooperation and Network Coding.

If the sensing is perfect, then the secondary nodes do not interfere with the primary node and thus do not affect its stable throughput. In case of imperfect sensing, it is shown that if the primary node's arrival rate is less than some calculated value, then the secondary transmissions do not affect its queueing stability; otherwise, the secondary nodes should regulate their transmission parameters to reduce their interference on the primary. It is also shown that in contrast with the primary user's maximum stable throughput rate which strictly decreases with increased sensing errors, the throughput of the secondary nodes might increase with sensing errors as more transmission opportunities become available to them. Finally, we explore the use of the secondary nodes as relays of the primary node's traffic to compensate for the interference they might cause. In this case, for appropriate modulation scheme and under perfect sensing, it is shown that the more secondary nodes in the system, the better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput. Meanwhile, the secondary nodes might benefit from relaying by having access to a larger number of idle slots becoming available to them due to the increase of the service rate of the primary. For the case of a single secondary node, the proposed relaying protocol guarantees that either both the primary and the secondary benefit from relaying or none of them does.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130317","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464643.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"523","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable Throughput in a Cognitive Wireless Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stable Throughput in a Cognitive Wireless Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464643/","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6464643/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342671","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable Throughput in a Cognitive Wireless Network","sourcePdf":"523jsac0313fanous.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075529S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6464644,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyue Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464644/6464644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongyue Xue (S'11) received the B.S. degree in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.

While providing deterministic upper-bounds for PU queue backlogs, the proposed algorithm approaches the optimal PU throughput arbitrarily close, with a tradeoff in the average delay upper-bounds of flows. The analysis is further extended to a model with a more general \"long-term reward mechanism\", where a time-averaged share of the channel is guaranteed for SUs. The proposed algorithm provides order-optimal delay for the primary traffic. Distributed implementation issues have also been investigated. The properties of the proposed algorithm have also been illustrated through simulation studies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","startPage":"534","endPage":"543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464644.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Scheduling for Cooperative Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6464644/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Scheduling for Cooperative Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342680","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Scheduling for Cooperative Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"534jsac0313xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090827S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464645,"authors":[{"name":"Wesam Gabran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Irvine, USA","Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464645/6464645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wesam Gabran (S'04) was born in Cairo, Egypt.

Elastic data traffic is a popular service whose service response time is an important QoS parameter. We analyze the mean response time of elastic data traffic service operating over a single channel time-slotted centralized CRN under three main service disciplines, namely, shortest processing time without preemption (SPTNP), shortest processing time with preemption, and shortest remaining processing time, in comparison with the processor sharing (PS) service discipline. It is shown that the SPTNP is a better choice over the PS service discipline when the traffic load is high, and that the preemption reduces the mean response time when the data file size (service time requirement) follows a heavy tailed distribution. The response time analysis can be used for call admission control to ensure service satisfaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","volume":"31","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13342672","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464646/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Service Response Time of Elastic Data Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Response Time of Elastic Data Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"559jsac0313gunaward.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121899S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464647,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We develop a strategy whereby the angular domain is divided into sectors, that are accessed via beamforming on a time division basis, to detect signals from primary users. We study the performance of detection metrics based on energy received per beam, and also eigenvalue-based detection statistics through considering the covariance matrix across the various directional beams. The ESPAR is able to achieve over 6dBi SNR improvement due to its beamforming capability. Further, once primary users' signals have been detected, directional transmit opportunities which do not interfere with active PUs become available, and we develop an adaptive beamforming algorithm to capitalise on these to efficiently utilise the spatial domain, which numerically optimises the beampattern and antenna efficiency using a convex formulation. The resulting beampatterns give between -20dB and -30dB nulls in the primary user direction.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464647.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Spatial Domain Cognitive Radio Using Single-Radio Parasitic Antenna Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464647/","displayDocTitle":"On Spatial Domain Cognitive Radio Using Single-Radio Parasitic Antenna Arrays","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342673","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464647/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Spatial Domain Cognitive Radio Using Single-Radio Parasitic Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"571jsac0313wilcox.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068264S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6464648,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Network Communications and Economics Laboratory (NCEL), Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464648/6464648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Gao is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Market-driven secondary spectrum trading is an effective way to achieve this goal, where primary spectrum owners (POs) temporarily lease their licensed spectrum bands to unlicensed secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we consider the short-term secondary spectrum trading between one PO (seller) and multiple SUs (buyers) in a hybrid spectrum market with both guaranteed contracts (futures market) and spot transactions (spot market). In particular, we focus on the PO's expected profit maximization under stochastic network information. The optimal solution consists of (i) a policy that maximizes the ex-ante expected profit based on the stochastic distribution of network information, and (ii) a selling mechanism that determines the real-time allocation and charging based on the realized network information and the derived policy. We study the optimal solution systematically under both information symmetry and asymmetry, depending on whether the PO can observe the SUs' realized private information. Under information symmetry, we show that the optimal solution can be achieved by a perfect price discrimination mechanism, which maximizes both the PO's expected profit (optimality) and the social welfare (efficiency). Under information asymmetry, we propose an integrated contract and auction design-ContrAuction-to elicit SUs' private information effectively. We derive analytically the optimal ContrAuction mechanisms that maximize the PO's expected profit with and without the constraint of efficiency, and characterize systematically the tradeoff between the PO's profit and the social welfare.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13342674","htmlLink":"/document/6464648/","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Contract and Auction Design for Secondary Spectrum Trading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Contract and Auction Design for Secondary Spectrum Trading","sourcePdf":"581jsac0313gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087137S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464649,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6464503/6464649/6464649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu Chen (S'10-M'12) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China) in 2012.

The spatial aspect of spectrum sharing, however, is less understood than many other aspects. In this paper, we generalize a recently proposed spatial congestion game framework to design efficient distributed spectrum access mechanisms with spatial reuse. We first propose a spatial channel selection game to model the distributed channel selection problem with fixed user locations. We show that the game is a potential game, and develop a distributed learning mechanism that converges to a Nash equilibrium only based on users' local observations. We then formulate the joint channel and location selection problem as a spatial channel selection and mobility game, and show that it is also a potential game. We next propose a distributed strategic mobility algorithm, jointly with the distributed learning mechanism, that can converge to a Nash equilibrium.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6464503/06464649.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"593","endPage":"603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Spectrum Access with Spatial Reuse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Spectrum Access with Spatial Reuse","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464649/","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6464649/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13342675","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Spectrum Access with Spatial Reuse","sourcePdf":"593jsac0313chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061176S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6464503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6464503","articleId":"6464649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6464954,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is the first time to use NUFFT technology in SAR image reconstruction. Instead of interpolating the input data, NUFFT interpolate the exponential function for each sampling point. The technology could easily extended to high dimensional by tensor product. The 2-D NUFFT is very suitable to reconstruct SAR image. A ground target example will shown to demonstrate that the reconstructed images have higher resolution than the general method when using the same data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Metamaterials (Meta)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459623/6464906/06464954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Metamaterials (Meta)","doi":"10.1109/META.2012.6464954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/META.2012.6464954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate 2-D nonuniform fast fourier transform method applied to high resolution SAR image reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Synthetic aperture radar","Interpolation","Fast Fourier transforms","Image resolution","Imaging","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sampling","interpolation","radar imaging","radar resolution","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D nonuniform fast Fourier transform method","high resolution SAR image reconstruction method","far-field data","Cartesian grid","NUFFT technology","input data interpolation","high dimensional by tensor product","sampling point","exponential function","ground target"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6464954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An accurate 2-D nonuniform fast fourier transform method applied to high resolution SAR image reconstruction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6464954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371753","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate 2-D nonuniform fast fourier transform method applied to high resolution SAR image reconstruction","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"215Hanmeta120043Ansccurate2Dnonuniform.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06677S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459623","isNumber":"6464906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459623","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6464906","articleId":"6464954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6465130,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Siegmund","affiliation":["Virtual Systems Research Center, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Skovde, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["FLORIAN SIEGMUND studied Computer Science and Operations Research at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.

This can be accomplished by letting the optimization algorithm make use of this preference information and guide the search towards better solutions that correspond to the preferences. One example for such kind of algorithms is the Reference point-based NSGA-II algorithm (R-NSGA-II), by which user-specified reference points can be used to guide the search in the objective space and the diversity of the focused Pareto-set can be controlled. In this paper, the applicability of the R-NSGA-II algorithm in solving industrial-scale simulation-based optimization problems is illustrated through a case study for the improvement of a production line.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2012.6465130","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451330/6464965/06465130.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2012.6465130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference point-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization for industrial systems simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Clustering algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Production","Algorithm design and analysis","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation","production management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reference point-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization","industrial systems simulation","Pareto-optimal solutions","decision making","reference point-based NSGA-II algorithm","R-NSGA-II","production line improvement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Reference point-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization for industrial systems simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13730039","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference point-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization for industrial systems simulation","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"con500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064407S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451330","isNumber":"6464965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451330","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6464965","articleId":"6465130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6465416,"authors":[{"name":"Faizal Arya Samman","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Faizal Arya","lastName":"Samman","id":"37704829500"},{"name":"Pongyupinpanich Surapong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Department of Computer Engineering, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pongyupinpanich","lastName":"Surapong","id":"37708182300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4891-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6465416","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6465416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Random access memory","Registers","Adders","Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPECTRON","biomeditronic application","streaming processor","adaptronic engineering application","floating point based scientific computation","digital signal processing application","floating point operators","dual port memory","Spectron","FPMAC cores","CORDIC cores","image processing","biomedical electronic engineering application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TermsReconfigurable Streaming Processor","Adaptive Signal Processing","Floating-Point Arithmetic","CORDIC Algorithm","Biomedical Electronic Engineering","Adaptronic"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a streaming processor specifically designed for adaptronic and biomedical engineering applications.

The processor can perform 4 parallel streaming/pipeline floating-point operations using its FPMAC and CORDIC cores, resulting in a performance of about 4\u00d7485 = 1.94 GFlops (Giga Floating-point operation per second), which is suitable for high performance image processing in biomedical electronic engineering applications.","doi":"10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465416","publicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457540/6465415/06465416.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPECTRON: Streaming processor specific for adaptronic and biomeditronic applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SPECTRON: Streaming processor specific for adaptronic and biomeditronic applications","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371169","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465416/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPECTRON: Streaming processor specific for adaptronic and biomeditronic applications","confLoc":"Muang, Thailand","sourcePdf":"BME2012005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088625S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457540","isNumber":"6465415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457540","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6465415","articleId":"6465416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6465448,"authors":[{"name":"Chinda Samakee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chinda","lastName":"Samakee","id":"37712536000"},{"name":"Pornchai Phukpattaranont","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pornchai","lastName":"Phukpattaranont","id":"37285039000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4892-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4891-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6465448","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6465448","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Oscillators","Ultrasonic imaging","Kernel","Imaging","Acoustics","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","bubbles","medical image processing","MIMO systems","nonlinear filters","oscillations","Volterra equations","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subharmonic identification","bubble oscillations","MIMO Volterra models","filter transfer function","Volterra systems","identification procedures","subharmonic oscillations","ultrasound contrast agent","impulse response functions","system identification","multiple-input-multiple-output Volterra series representation","image filtering","subharmonic frequency","ultrasound imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subharmonic oscillation","Ultrasound contrast agent","Nonlinear system identification","MIMO Volterra series"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465448","publicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457540/6465415/06465448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of subharmonic in bubble oscillations using MIMO Volterra models","abstract":"Analysis only in filter transfer function of Volterra systems is sufficient but maybe not faultless.

In the experiment, a tri-axial accelerometer was attached to waists of five healthy and young people. In order to evaluate the performance of the fall detection, five young people were asked to simulate four daily-life activities and four falls; walking, jumping, flopping on bed, rising from bed, front fall, back fall, left fall and right fall.

However, nonuniform sampling at low average rate has received much less attention. While uniform sampling rate needs to be at least twice the bandwidth of a signal (Nyquist rate), in theory, nonuniform sampling at sub-Nyquist rate should be adequate for faithful reconstruction if the signal is sufficiently sparse. Noting the known sparsity ECG signals, we attempt to demonstrate sub-Nyquist sampling of such signals. However, alongside this opportunity, reconstruction from nonuniform samples also poses a particular challenge. While uniform sampling admits universal (signal-independent) reconstruction (via sinc interpolation), reconstruction from nonuniform samples is generally data-dependent. In this paper, we make use of compressive sampling theory to demonstrate that nonuniform sampling does provide universal performance guarantee. In our experiments, we use ANSI/AAMI standard test ECG signals, and tune the orthogonal mathing pursuit algorithm for those to obtain superior performance. Our results potentially facilitates development of low-power ECG recording devices with potential application in remote locations without grid power.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465510","publicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th 2012 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457540/6465415/06465510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/BMEiCon.2012.6465510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal nonuniform sampling of ECG signals: Opportunities and obstacles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Universal nonuniform sampling of ECG signals: Opportunities and obstacles","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6465510/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371260","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465510/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal nonuniform sampling of ECG signals: Opportunities and obstacles","confLoc":"Muang, Thailand","sourcePdf":"BME2012126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047479S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6457540","isNumber":"6465415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457540","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6465415","articleId":"6465510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6465542,"authors":[{"name":"Manuj Sharma","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Manuj","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37405455600"},{"name":"Anirudha Sahoo","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Anirudha","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37298471300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5494-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5330-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5329-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-2487"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-2509"}],"articleNumber":"6465542","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Schedules","Ribs","Interference","Receivers","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic multichannel access protocol","dynamic spectrum access networks","multichannel MAC protocol","cognitive radio-enabled secondary users","residual white space distribution-based cognitive MAC protocol","channel residual idle time distribution","sender SU node","receiver SU node","data channel negotiation","interference probability","SU transmission","primary user","RWS-CMAC protocol"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6465542","doi":"10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465542","publicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)","abstract":"We propose a multichannel MAC protocol for cognitive radio enabled Secondary Users (SUs) called Residual White Space Distribution based Cognitive MAC protocol (RWS-CMAC).

The objective of this work is to study the feasibility of using CRN for delay sensitive applications in the presence of primary users with random ON/OFF periods. The first contribution of this work is the modeling of a cognitive node as a Queuing system and characterization of the average delay encountered by a packet on a cognitive node for various scheduling disciplines. This delay characterization gives the application/user the decision power to choose whether to transmit using a particular node depending upon the delay and rate requirements. It also gives the designer of higher layer the ability to make more informed decisions for routing in a multiple node scenario. The second contribution of this work is a comparative study of various scheduling disciplines in a cognitive radio environment. We have considered First Come First Serve (FCFS), strict priority and a proposed Queue Proportional Batch Scheduling (QPBS). QPBS maintains a balance between priority and fairness as opposed to the strict priority scheduling where the fairness is sacrificed at the cost of priority and FCFS where there is no notion of priority. This comparative study clearly brings out the relative pros and cons of aforementioned scheduling schemes in a cognitive radio environment. A discrete event based simulation study has been performed to verify the efficacy of mathematical modeling and validate the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465543/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13371111","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465543/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of scheduling schemes for cognitive radio networks: A quality of service perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of scheduling schemes for cognitive radio networks: A quality of service perspective","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"comsnets08Swarup2621905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072297S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451320","isNumber":"6465521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451320","xplore-issue":"6465521","articleId":"6465543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6465545,"authors":[{"name":"Tamaghna Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engg, Bengal Engineering and Science University Shibpur, Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Tamaghna","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37702442500"},{"name":"Swagata Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engg, Bengal Engineering and Science University Shibpur, Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Swagata","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37086728024"},{"name":"Santi P.

This is mainly due to the low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of SC-FDMA compared to that of OFDMA. Long-term evolution (LTE) uses SC-FDMA on the uplink to exploit this PAPR advantage to reduce transmit power amplifier backoff in user terminals. In this paper, we show that SC-FDMA can be beneficially used for multiuser communication on the downlink as well. We present SC-FDMA transmit and receive signaling architectures for multiuser communication on the downlink. The benefits of using SC-FDMA on the downlink are that SC-FDMA can achieve i) significantly better bit error rate (BER) performance at the user terminal compared to OFDMA, and ii) improved PAPR compared to OFDMA which reduces base station (BS) power amplifier backoff (making BSs more green). SC-FDMA receiver needs to do joint equalization, which can be carried out using low complexity equalization techniques. For this, we present a local neighborhood search based equalization algorithm for SC-FDMA. This algorithm is very attractive both in complexity as well as performance. We present simulation results that establish the PAPR and BER performance advantage of SC-FDMA over OFDMA in multiuser SISO/MIMO downlink as well as in large-scale multiuser MISO downlink with tens to hundreds of antennas at the BS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6465546/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13371114","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SC-FDMA for multiuser communication on the downlink","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SC-FDMA for multiuser communication on the downlink","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"comsnets11InvitedChockalingam2621137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048853S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451320","isNumber":"6465521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451320","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6465521","articleId":"6465546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6465548,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Kokku","affiliation":["IBM Research, Bangalore, India","NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Kokku","id":"37322197800"},{"name":"Rajesh Mahindra","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, USA"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Mahindra","id":"37392246400"},{"name":"Honghai Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, USA"],"firstName":"Honghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280794700"},{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, USA"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan","id":"37282909600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5494-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5330-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5329-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-2487"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-2509"}],"articleNumber":"6465548","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1710},"abstract":"We present the design and implementation of Cell-Slice, a novel system for slicing wireless resources in a cellular network for effective Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing. CellSlice is a gateway-level solution that achieves the slicing without modifying the basestations' MAC schedulers, thereby significantly reducing the barrier for its adoption. Achieving slicing with a gateway-level solution is challenging, however, since resource scheduling decisions occur at the basestations at fine timescales, and these decisions are not visible at the gateways. In the uplink direction, CellSlice overcomes the challenge by indirectly constraining the uplink scheduler's decisions using a simple feedback-based adaptation algorithm. For downlink, we build on the technique used by NVS, a native basestation virtualization solution, and show that effective downlink slicing can be easily achieved without modifying basestation schedulers. We instantiate a prototype of CellSlice on a Picochip WiMAX testbed. Through both prototype evaluation and simulations, we demonstrate that CellSlice's performance for both remote uplink and remote downlink slicing is close to that of NVS. CellSlice's design is access-technology independent, and hence can be equally applicable to LTE, LTE-Advanced and WiMAX networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on

design an adaptive modulation scheme to support opportunistic multicast scheduling in wireless networks. Whereas prior work optimizes capacity, we investigate the finite horizon problem where (once or repeatedly) a fixed number of packets has to be transmitted to a set of wireless receivers in the shortest amount of time - a common problem, e.g., for software updates or video multicast. In the finite horizon problem, the optimum coding and modulation schemes critically depend on the recent reception history of the receivers and require a fine balance between maximizing overall throughput and equalizing individual receiver throughput. We formulate a dynamic programming algorithm that optimally solves this scheduling problem. We then develop two low complexity heuristics that perform very close to the optimal solution and are suitable for practical online scheduling in base stations. We further analyze the performance of our algorithms by means of simulation in a wide range of wireless scenarios. They substantially outperform existing solutions based on throughput maximization or favoring the user with the worst channel, and we obtain a 35% performance improvement over the former and a 100% improvement over the latter in a scenario with Rayleigh fading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13371128","htmlLink":"/document/6465560/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation for finite horizon multicasting of erasure-coded data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation for finite horizon multicasting of erasure-coded data","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"comsnets25Sim2653595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080641S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451320","isNumber":"6465521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451320","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6465521","articleId":"6465560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6465585,"authors":[{"name":"R Vanlin Sathya","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, IN"],"firstName":"R Vanlin","lastName":"Sathya"},{"name":"Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Bheemarjuna Reddy","lastName":"Tamma","id":"37398218800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5494-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5330-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5329-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-2487"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-2509"}],"articleNumber":"6465585","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Dynamic scheduling","Interference","Bandwidth","Computer science","Electronic mail","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","radio spectrum management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum allocation","femto based LTE network","3GPP","LTE femto cells","indoor users","macro cells","LTE femto based system","user traffic demands","enterprise cellular deployments"]}],"abstract":"3GPP has introduced LTE Femto cells to handle the traffic for indoor users and to reduce the load on the Macro cells.

Distribution grid reconfiguration is one of the methods of accommodating more DG into the electric grid, which is illustrated with the help of a 16 node test network in this paper. The reconfiguration of the distribution grid involves changing the grid topology thereby optimizing a few objectives. In addition to the inclusion of DGs, grid reconfiguration also helps in achieving minimal power loss, minimal voltage deviation etc. In this paper the grid reconfiguration problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Simple genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant NSGA-II are used for solving the optimization problem. For a simple test system like the 16 node system discussed in this paper, simple GA is efficient enough to find the global optimum for a single objective optimization. The paper also illustrates the advantage of NSGA-II compared to simple GA when multiple objectives are considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465615/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13371327","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465615/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Smart grid reconfiguration using simple genetic algorithm and NSGA-II","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart grid reconfiguration using simple genetic algorithm and NSGA-II","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"2012ISGTEU011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071816S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450175","isNumber":"6465601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6465601","articleId":"6465615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6465690,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Marra","affiliation":["Department of Technology Development, SMA Solar Technology AG, Niestetal, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6450175/6465601/6465690/6465690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Marra (Student member, IEEE) received the B.

To cope with the effects on grid voltage profiles during high generation and low demand periods, new solutions need to be established. In the long term, these solutions should also aim to allow further more PV installed capacity, while meeting the power quality requirements. In this paper, different concepts of energy storage are proposed to ensure the voltage quality requirements in a LV grid with high PV penetration. The proposed storage concepts can cooperate with reactive power methods and can be used to avoid grid reinforcement and active power curtailment. For the study, a residential LV grid with high share of PV generation is used. Simulation results show substantial benefits for the LV feeders operation, as well as an increased potential for local consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465690","publicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450175/6465601/06465690.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy storage options for voltage support in low-voltage grids with high penetration of photovoltaic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6465690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465690/","displayDocTitle":"Energy storage options for voltage support in low-voltage grids with high penetration of photovoltaic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371402","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465690/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy storage options for voltage support in low-voltage grids with high penetration of photovoltaic","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"2012ISGTEU086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099998S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450175","isNumber":"6465601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450175","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6465601","articleId":"6465690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6465734,"authors":[{"name":"Sven C.

For the design of time-critical applications, simulation tools for an integrated analysis of these domains are needed. In the case of electrical transmission systems, high-performance ICT solutions and fast controllable power equipment enable a new era of dynamic power system operation whereas applications for this purpose need to be investigated with a special focus on their real-time performance. This paper presents a novel, modular co-simulation environment for comprehensive analysis of mutual effects, taking into account communication networks, IT processing and power system response. This hybrid simulation environment has been developed with a focus on the evaluation of the real-time performance of wide-area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) applications, nonetheless, it is applicable to a variety of smart grid applications in transmission and distribution networks. The simulator architecture takes into account various standards from different areas of research - such as IEEE 1516-2000 (High-Level Architecture), IEC 61850, OPC and CIM - in order to provide a highly flexible simulation environment and to enable development of applications close to industrial implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465734","publicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450175/6465601/06465734.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6465734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid simulation of power systems and ICT for real-time applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid simulation of power systems and ICT for real-time applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465734/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371446","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid simulation of power systems and ICT for real-time applications","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"2012ISGTEU130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061432S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450175","isNumber":"6465601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450175","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6465601","articleId":"6465734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6465749,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Das","affiliation":["IBM Research, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"p":["Kaushik Das received his M.Tech(Master of Technology) in Power System Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2011.

System states are estimated when a set of SCADA and/or PMU measurements come in. As PMU measurements come much faster (typically one sample in 20ms) than SCADA measurements (typically one sample in 10 seconds), in between two SCADA measurements, system states of PMU unobservable buses are interpolated using an interpolation matrix (H)live PMU measurements. In between two SCADA samples, if PMU measurements change significantly, pre-computed interpolation matrix (H) is compensated with a sensitivity change matrix (\u0394H) and system states are estimated using the corrected interpolation matrix. In order to compute the \u0394H, the method classified the measurement set into four sub-sets i.e. PMU measurements, SCADA measurements of PMU boundary buses with significant change, SCADA measurements adjacent to the selected boundary buses, and remaining SCADA measurements and run a modified weighted least square method with different weights corresponding to each sub-set of measurements. This compensation improves the estimation accuracy significantly. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated on a number of IEEE benchmark test systems and evaluation results are presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465749","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6450175/6465601/06465749.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time hybrid state estimation incorporating SCADA and PMU measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Real-time hybrid state estimation incorporating SCADA and PMU measurements","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6465749/","accessionNumber":"13371461","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6465749/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time hybrid state estimation incorporating SCADA and PMU measurements","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"2012ISGTEU145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057388S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6450175","isNumber":"6465601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6450175","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6465601","articleId":"6465749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6465854,"authors":[{"name":"Dino Ablakovic","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Dino Ablakovic received his Dipl E1. lng. degree at The University of Tuzla, Bosnia in 2005.

Furthermore, reset current is found to decrease with reducing nanopillar transistor design diameter, which is beneficial for circuit power consumption concern.","doi":"10.1109/INEC.2013.6466006","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 5th International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6457517/6465934/06466006.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INEC.2013.6466006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6465934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully CMOS compatible 1T1R integration of vertical nanopillar GAA transistor and Oxide based RRAM cell for high density nonvolatile memory application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fully CMOS compatible 1T1R integration of vertical nanopillar GAA transistor and Oxide based RRAM cell for high density nonvolatile memory application","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13357398","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466006/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466006/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jan. 2013","conferenceDate":"2-4 Jan. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully CMOS compatible 1T1R integration of vertical nanopillar GAA transistor and Oxide based RRAM cell for high density nonvolatile memory application","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP072303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091151S","chronDate":"2-4 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6457517","isNumber":"6465934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6457517","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6465934","articleId":"6466006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6466009,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chih","lastName":"Huang","id":"38552789900"},{"name":"Huan-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huan-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"38550202300"},{"name":"Huang-Chung Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huang-Chung","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280210300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4842-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4840-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4841-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3531"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3523"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2159-3523"}],"articleNumber":"6466009","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":678},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Films","Electrodes","Copper","Oxidation","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","electrodes","platinum","random-access storage","semiconductor doping","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RRAM cell","random access memory cells","inert electrodes","conductive-bridging mode sample structure","copper active electrode","nondoped titania film","platinum inert electrode","resistance resistive switching characteristics","conductive filaments","electrical characteristics measurements","material analysis","Cu:TiO2","Pt"]}],"abstract":"The random access memory (RRAM) cells consisted with the Cu doped TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n film and both Pt inert electrodes has been purposed.

Most of the available Meta heuristic algorithms attempt to find an optimal solution with respect to a specific fixed fitness measure. The major challenges when using Genetic Algorithms to solve dynamic optimization problems are: (a) to generate and keep the diversity in the populations, which is crucial for avoiding the premature convergence to the local optima and (b) to evolve robust solutions that are able to track the optima. All of these issues will necessitate the development of intelligent adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adapt to the changes in the large-scale Computing Groups.

These offset are compensated by phase compensation interpolation techniques, toward recover the presentation of the OFDM scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of DAP symbols using asynchronized OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466139","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451322/6466095/06466139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of DAP symbols using asynchronized OFDM system","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466139/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13357223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of DAP symbols using asynchronized OFDM system","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"PID172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0386S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451322","isNumber":"6466095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451322","xplore-issue":"6466095","articleId":"6466139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466141,"authors":[{"name":"N.

All the way through the innovation in era and its expanding burden, swift development has occurred within the communication field. Electrical quantities, which were initially transferred in the continuous sphere, are drived further and further in the discrete sphere in existence. In favor of enhanced diffusion, distinct rate influences are being substituted through multi rates. Multi rate arrangements like CDMA and OFDM are used frequently in practice. Within the OFDM arrangement, orthogonally located subcarriers are used to embrace the information from the spreader side to the recipient side. The complexity of ISI can be overcome by the existence of guard band in this arrangement and by superior amount of subcarriers the effect of noise gets diminished. On the other hand the huge Peak to Average Power Ratio of these pointers has several objectionable possessions on the arrangement. In this paper various methods are proposed to diminish PAPR in the OFDM arrangement as a result this arrangement can be worned further frequently plus successfully.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466141","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451322/6466095/06466141.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved performance in OFDM systems by PAPR reduction techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466141/","displayDocTitle":"Improved performance in OFDM systems by PAPR reduction techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13357225","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466141/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved performance in OFDM systems by PAPR reduction techniques","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"PID174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058384S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451322","isNumber":"6466095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451322","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6466095","articleId":"6466141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6466152,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As far as memory applications are concerned the soft errors and single event upsets are always a matter of problem. The paper mainly focuses on the design of an efficient Majority Logic Detector/Decoder (MLDD) for fault detection along with correction of fault for memory applications, by considerably reducing fault detection time. The error detection and correction method is done by one step majority logic decoding and is made effective for Euclidean Geometry Low Density Parity Check Codes (EG-LDPC). Even though majority decodable codes can correct large number of errors, they need high decoding time for detection of errors and ML Decoding method may take same fault detecting time for both erroneous and error free code words, which in turn delays the memory performance. The proposed fault-detection method can detect the fault in less decoding cycles (almost in three). When the data read is error free, it can obviously reduce memory access time. The technique keeps the area overhead minimal and power consumption low for large code word sizes.","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451322/6466095/06466152.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466152","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fault detection and correction technique for memory applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel fault detection and correction technique for memory applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466152/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6466152/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13357236","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fault detection and correction technique for memory applications","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"PID208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054658S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451322","isNumber":"6466095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451322","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466095","articleId":"6466152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466153,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An improved energy function was designed for the HNN to perform the boundary detection which was formulated, in this paper, as an optimization process that could locate the boundary points of wood defects. The gray value of each pixel in the image was considered as a neuron state of HNN. An initial defect boundary was roughly estimated using Canny Algorithm. Based on the initial states, all the neuron's states updated till the energy function get the minimum value. The defect boundary was identified when the neurons get the final states. The results show we obtain a more accurate boundary using this method comparing to using other traditional methods, and the noises were effectively removed.

The viterbi decoder using survivor path with necessary parameters for wireless communication is an attempt to reduce the power and cost and at the same time increase the speed compared to normal decoder. This paper presents three objectives. Firstly, an orthodox viterbi decoder is designed and simulated. For faster process application, the Gate Diffused Input Logic (GDIL) based viterbi decoder is designed using Xilinx ISE, simulated and synthesized successfully. The new proposed GDIL viterbi provides very less path delay with low power simulation results. Secondly, the GDIL viterbi is again compared with our proposed technique, which comprises a Survivor Path Unit (SPU) implements a trace back method with DRAM. This proposed approach of incorporating DRAM stores the path information in a manner which allows fast read access without requiring physical partitioning of the DRAM. This leads to a comprehensive gain in speed with low power effects. Thirdly, all the viterbi decoders are compared, simulated, synthesized and the proposed approach shows the best simulation and synthesize results for low power and high speed application in VLSI design. The Add-Compare-Select (ACS) and Trace Back (TB) units and its sub circuits of the decoder(s) have been operated in deep pipelined manner to achieve high transmission rate. Although the register exchange based survivor unit has better throughput when compared to trace back unit, but in this paper by introducing the RAM cell between the ACS array and output register bank, a significant amount of reduction in path delay has been observed. All the designing of viterbi is done using Xilinx ISE 12.4 and synthesized successfully in the FPGA Virtex 6 target device operated at 64.516 MHz clock frequency, reduces almost 41% of total path delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13357249","htmlLink":"/document/6466245/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speed optimization of a FPGA based modified viterbi decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed optimization of a FPGA based modified viterbi decoder","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"PID234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063429S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451322","isNumber":"6466095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451322","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6466095","articleId":"6466245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466247,"authors":[{"name":"Barnali Goswami","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Assam Engineering College, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Barnali","lastName":"Goswami","id":"37089102267"},{"name":"Vanita Agrawal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Assam Engineering College, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Vanita","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37086648867"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2907-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2906-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2905-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466247","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Fuzzy logic","Security","Fuels","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security constrained economic dispatch","hybrid fuzzy genetic algorithm approach","adaptive probabilities","convergence capacity","genetic algorithm operators","cross-over operators","mutation operators","fuzzy logic approach","IEEE 30-bus 6-unit systems","IEEE 6-bus 3-unit systems","convergence property","computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Security Constrained Economic Dispatch","Fuzzy Logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466247","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451322/6466095/06466247.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Constrained Economic Dispatch using a hybrid Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm approach","abstract":"Premature convergence, which occurs due to loss of diversity, is one of the major issues in Genetic Algorithm.

This paper introduces a relatively simple method, which is more tolerant to such cases. In the proposed method, word segmentation requires the document to be already segmented into text lines. The proposed system begins with pre-processing the scanned image of the handwritten text, to increase the accuracy of recognition by enhancing some features and eliminating some inconsistencies. It solves the issue of spatial measure and threshold, which are sensitive to shape the connected component (CC), by reducing the region of interest to core region. This method rectifies the problem of segmenting words from lines using bounding box (BB) method, which suppresses the structure of character. Trimmed mean (TM) is used to detect the core region and also as threshold for gap discrimination in this segmentation method. The system was developed in Java and its performance was evaluated on word images selected from the IAM database.

therefore, the control algorithms are invariantly subjected to approximations. This paper presents a novel technique for implementation of an efficient FPGA based digital Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for the motion control of a permanent magnet DC motor. The implementation technique circumnavigates the problem of interfacing analog and digital systems in real-time. The controller is used in a speed control loop. The hardware implementation has been done on a Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA chip.

The fractional Fourier transform has many applications recently like we can compute the DFTs of sequences with prime lengths and sparse sequences, sequences of noninteger periodicities, reducing the noise in noisy images but it is possible when the noise and data are uncorrelated, in sonar signal processing and this transform gives better results compared to the Fourier transform in many areas.

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not.

The basic idea of ICA is to find the underlying independent components in the mixture by searching for a linear or nonlinear transformation and minimizing the statistical dependence between components. Due to the computational complexity of ICA and commonly used data sets, the ICA process is very time-consuming. For reducing the complexity of ICA algorithm, modularity, hierarchy and parallelism are introduced in VLSI implementation. It is more efficient when the cost function, which measures the independence of the components, is optimized. System level design of ICA with evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed for EEG signal processing. The use of evolutionary computation based optimizations i.e Adaptive Shuffled Frog Leap Optimization Algorithm with additional operations of mutation, crossover and feedback resolves the permutation ambiguity to a large extent [8]. This ensures the convergence of the algorithm to a global optimum and its VLSI implementation ensures high speed processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466314","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451322/6466095/06466314.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of optimized independent component analysis processor for biomedical application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of optimized independent component analysis processor for biomedical application","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466314/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13357318","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of optimized independent component analysis processor for biomedical application","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"PID357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074109S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451322","isNumber":"6466095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6466095","articleId":"6466314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466317,"authors":[{"name":"Jyoti Mansukhani","affiliation":["Defence Research and Development Organisation, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Jyoti","lastName":"Mansukhani","id":"38542896300"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["G.S.Sanyal School of Telecommunications, IIT, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Saswat","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37287172900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2907-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2906-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2905-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466317","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Peak to average power ratio","Indexes","Reflection","Computers","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","marine communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","PAPR reduction","OFDM signal","Marine Channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","OFDM modulation","orthogonal subcarriers","multipath fading","OFDM systems","peak-to average power ratio","high power amplifier","SLM technique","demodulation","degrading transmission efficiency","sea environment","cyclic shifting","marine channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","high power amplifier (HPA)","SLM","Marine Channel"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation using orthogonal subcarriers reduces the delay spread by increasing robustness to multipath fading and can use overlapped bandwidth due to orthogonality on frequency domain.

Several methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce the peak power of OFDM signals and substantial gains were reported. In SLM technique of PAPR reduction, side information needs to be transmitted for demodulation while degrading transmission efficiency.

However, existing versioning file systems do not perform well with the emerging PCM (phase-change memory) storage, because they are optimized for hard disks. Specifically, a large amount of additional writes incurred by maintaining snapshot degrades the performance of PCM seriously as write operations are the performance bottleneck of PCM. This paper presents a novel versioning file system, designed for PCM, that reduces the writing overhead of a snapshot significantly. Unlike existing versioning file systems that incur cascade writes up to the file system root, our scheme breaks the recursive update chain at the immediate parent level. The proposed file system is implemented on Linux 2.6 as a prototype. Measurement studies with various I/O benchmarks show that the proposed file system improves the I/O throughput by 144 percent on average, compared to ZFS, a representative versioning file system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466325/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13875718","volume":"25","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On-Demand Snapshot: An Efficient Versioning File System for Phase-Change Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Demand Snapshot: An Efficient Versioning File System for Phase-Change Memory","sourcePdf":"ttk2013122841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106311S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6648553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6648553","articleId":"6466325","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6466333,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Zeeshan Shakir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6466333/6466333-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Zeeshan Shakir (M'03) received B.E. degree in electrical engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan, in 2002.

The generalization of the detectors namely (i) the eigenvalue ratio detector (ERD) involving the ratio of the largest and the smallest eigenvalues; (ii) the Geometric mean detector (GEMD) involving the ratio of the largest eigenvalue and the geometric mean of the eigenvalues and (iii) the Arithmetic mean detector (ARMD) involving the ratio of the largest and the arithmetic mean of the eigenvalues is explored. The foundation of the proposed unified framework is based on the calculation of exact analytical moments of the random variables of test statistics of the respective detectors. In this context, we approximate the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistics of the respective detectors by Gaussian/Gamma PDF using the moment matching method. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions to calculate the decision threshold of the eigenvalue based detectors by exchanging the derived exact moments of the random variables of test statistics with the moments of the Gaussian/Gamma distribution function. The performance of the eigenvalue based detectors is compared with the traditional detectors such as energy detector (ED) and cyclostationary detector (CSD) and validate the importance of the eigenvalue based detectors particularly over realistic wireless cognitive environments. Analytical and simulation results show that the GEMD and the ARMD yields considerable performance advantage in realistic spectrum sensing scenarios. Moreover, our results based on proposed simple and tractable approximation approaches are in perfect agreement with the empirical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","volume":"61","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13487687","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466333/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Mean Detector for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Mean Detector for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"1242-tc1304-zeeshan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122775S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6466333","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6466334,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Hessar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6466334/6466334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farzad Hessar Farzad Hessar received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology in 2008 and M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology in 2010.

Implementation of such source coding techniques in wireless networks requires the application of coding mechanisms (such as multilayer coding) which allow unequal error protection for different layers of the transmitted data. In this paper, we study the performance of multilayer coding for quasi-static fading channels where the source and the destination are equipped with multiple antennas and the Channel-State-Information (CSI) is only known at the destination. We limit the study to the scenarios where the destination is only able to perform successive-decoding (joint-decoding is not possible) and the objective is to find the design of a multilayer code which maximizes the average data rate received at the destination. To this end, we first propose a design rule for constructing a proper multilayer code for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) networks. Furthermore, the paper presents a procedure which uses the proposed design rule to determine the parameters of the multilayer code. The performance of the designed multilayer coding scheme is then studied for different network setups.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021513.110826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6514800/06466336.pdf","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021513.110826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer Codes for Broadcasting over Quasi-Static Fading MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466336/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer Codes for Broadcasting over Quasi-Static Fading MIMO Networks","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487690","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466336/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer Codes for Broadcasting over Quasi-Static Fading MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"1573-tc1304-vahid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078567S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6466336","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466338,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Under pairwise correlation and joint Gaussian assumption of received signals in frequency domain, an approximated form of the log-likelihood function is derived. Instead of a high complexity two-dimension grid-search on the likelihood function, a five-step method is employed for accurate estimations. Several variants are presented in the same framework with different complexities. Unlike conventional pilot-assisted schemes using the extra phase rotations within one OFDM block, the proposed technique turns to the phase rotations between adjacent OFDM blocks. Analytical expressions of the variances and biases are derived. Extensive simulation results indicate significant performance improvements over conventional schemes. Additionally, effects of several noise models including non-Gaussianity, cyclo-stationarity, and temporal correlation are analyzed and simulated. Robustness of the proposed technique against violation of the joint Gaussian assumption is also verified by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021413.120112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6514800/06466340.pdf","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021413.120112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Sampling Timing Acquisition for Baseband OFDM Power-Line Communication in Non-Gaussian Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466340/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Sampling Timing Acquisition for Baseband OFDM Power-Line Communication in Non-Gaussian Noise","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487692","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466340/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Sampling Timing Acquisition for Baseband OFDM Power-Line Communication in Non-Gaussian Noise","sourcePdf":"1608-tc1304-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154941S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6466340","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466342,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Ivanov","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6466342/6466342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mikhail Ivanov was born in 1986 in St. Petersburg, Russia.

This paper proposes energy-aware, optimal power allocation schemes for an amplify-and-forward cooperative communication system in the presence of imperfect CSI, to i) minimize the total transmit power; ii) maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Energy awareness is incorporated in the schemes either by avoiding over-provisioning of quality-of-service (QoS) or, by preventing unsuccessful transmissions, depending on the application. In both the schemes, the source and relay nodes share a fixed total transmit power budget, and transmission is allowed only if the minimum required end-to-end SNR can be achieved with the available power budget. Closed-form expressions for the source and relay optimal transmit powers are derived for both these schemes. Performance of the systems under the proposed schemes are investigated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021513.100278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06466345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021513.100278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Power Allocation in Cooperative Communication Systems with Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Power Allocation in Cooperative Communication Systems with Imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530836","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6466345/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Power Allocation in Cooperative Communication Systems with Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"1633-tc1305-rajiv.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077518S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6466345","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466348,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Simulation results for different figures of merit, such as optical common-mode rejection ratios (CMRRs) and phase errors, are provided for both nominal and worst case scenarios. Additionally, system simulations are performed to compute imbalance-induced power penalty. Our results indicate that the combined effect of realistic foundry tolerances on device performance is significant. In particular, a fourfold reduction is predicted between nominal (\u224340 nm) and worst cases (\u224310 nm) when optical CMRRs and phase errors are compared against Optical Internetworking Forum specifications. By contrast, a much greater bandwidth is expected at the system level (\u2265 40 nm) if a power penalty of less than 1 dB (@BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n) is to be allowed.

In our considered EH system, there is one information transmitting (ITx) node, one traditional information receiving (IRx) node and multiple EH nodes. EH nodes can transform the received electromagnetic waves into energy to enlarge the network operation life. When the ITx node sends signals to the destination, it should also optimize the beamforming/precoder matrix to charge the EH nodes efficiently simultaneously. Additionally, the charged energy should be larger than a predefined threshold. Under the EH constraints, in our work both minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) and mutual information are taken as the performance metrics for the beamforming designs at the ITx node. In order to make the proposed algorithms suitable for practical implementation and have affordable overhead, our work focuses on the beamforming designs with partial CSI and this is the distinct contribution of our work. Finally, numerical results are given to show the performance advantages of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2247999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6461093/06466369.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2247999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461093","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Beamforming Designs With Partial CSI Under Energy Harvesting Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Beamforming Designs With Partial CSI Under Energy Harvesting Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13353435","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6466369/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Beamforming Designs With Partial CSI Under Energy Harvesting Constraints","sourcePdf":"lsp-xing-2247999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069054S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6461093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6461093","articleId":"6466369","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466377,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Lun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Lun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065817700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6466377","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2272},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Very large scale integration","Interpolation","Clamps","Memory management","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","convolution","image restoration","interpolation","spatial filters","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","low-cost high-quality image scaling processor","spatial filter","clamp filter","bilinear interpolation","blurring reduction","inversed T-model convolution kernels","CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilinear","clamp filter","image zooming","reconfigurable calculation unit (RCU)","sharpening spatial filter","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a low-complexity, low-memory-requirement, and high-quality algorithm is proposed for VLSI implementation of an image scaling processor. The proposed image scaling algorithm consists of a sharpening spatial filter, a clamp filter, and a bilinear interpolation. To reduce the blurring and aliasing artifacts produced by the bilinear interpolation, the sharpening spatial and clamp filters are added as prefilters. To minimize the memory buffers and computing resources for the proposed image processor design, a T-model and inversed T-model convolution kernels are created for realizing the sharpening spatial and clamp filters. Furthermore, two T-model or inversed T-model filters are combined into a combined filter which requires only a one-line-buffer memory. Moreover, a reconfigurable calculation unit is invented for decreasing the hardware cost of the combined filter. Moreover, the computing resource and hardware cost of the bilinear interpolator can be efficiently reduced by an algebraic manipulation and hardware sharing techniques.

Most current SAEAs, however, focus on small-scale problems. SAEAs for medium-scale problems (i.e., 20-50 decision variables) have not yet been well studied. In this paper, a Gaussian process surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithm for medium-scale computationally expensive optimization problems (GPEME) is proposed and investigated. Its major components are a surrogate model-aware search mechanism for expensive optimization problems when a high-quality surrogate model is difficult to build and dimension reduction techniques for tackling the \u201ccurse of dimensionality.\u201d A new framework is developed and used in GPEME, which carefully coordinates the surrogate modeling and the evolutionary search, so that the search can focus on a small promising area and is supported by the constructed surrogate model. Sammon mapping is introduced to transform the decision variables from tens of dimensions to a few dimensions, in order to take advantage of Gaussian process surrogate modeling in a low-dimensional space. Empirical studies on benchmark problems with 20, 30, and 50 variables and a real-world power amplifier design automation problem with 17 variables show the high efficiency and effectiveness of GPEME. Compared to three state-of-the-art SAEAs, better or similar solutions can be obtained with 12% to 50% exact function evaluations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"18","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14196619","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6466380/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Gaussian Process Surrogate Model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Medium Scale Expensive Optimization Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Gaussian Process Surrogate Model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Medium Scale Expensive Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-liu-2248012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130741S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6779627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"6779627","articleId":"6466380","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466393,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Shang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6563118/6466393/6466393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Shang (S\u201912) was born in Shandong, China.

Reduced CMV space-vector modulation (RCMV SVM) methods have been proposed in both voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC) systems. The available RCMV SVMs reduce the CMV by avoiding using zero-state vectors. However, this will lead to some negative effects, such as shrink of modulation index range, increase of switching frequencies, bipolar line-to-line voltage pulse patterns in VSCs, and power quality performance deterioration. In this paper, a RCMV SVM method for CSCs is proposed. By allowing the use of zero-state vectors, the proposed RCMV SVM still produces much lower CMV. However, its other performance indices, such as switching frequency and harmonic performance, are unaffected and comparable to the conventional SVMs. The effectiveness of the proposed RCMV SVM for CSCs is verified in the simulations and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2248025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6563118/06466393.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2248025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space-Vector Modulation Method for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Current-Source Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Vector Modulation Method for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Current-Source Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466393/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13678450","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Vector Modulation Method for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Current-Source Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-shang-2248025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230861S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6563118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6563118","articleId":"6466393","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6466395,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Daniel J.

These issues result in modeling difficulty because a large pool of candidate models almost fit the data equally well. Through the Integrated Nanomanufacturing and Nanoinformatics (INN) strategy, we derive the process models from physical and statistical domains, respectively, and reinforce the understanding of growth processes by identifying the common model structure across two domains. This cross-domain model building strategy essentially validates models by domain knowledge rather than by (unavailable) data. It not only increases modeling confidence under large uncertainties, but also enables insightful physical understanding of the growth kinetics. We present this method by studying the weight growth kinetics of silica nanowire under two temperature conditions. The derived nanowire growth model is able to provide physical insights for prediction and control under uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2013.2243433","startPage":"571","endPage":"578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/6549150/06466395.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2013.2243433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Domain Model Building and Validation (CDMV): A New Modeling Strategy to Reinforce Understanding of Nanomanufacturing Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Nanobioscience","Mathematical model","Uncertainty","Silicon compounds","Kinetic theory","Absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanofabrication","nanowires","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silica nanowire","physical domain","statistical domain","INN strategy","integrated nanomanufacturing and nanoinformatics","nanomanufacturing process","cross-domain model building and validation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-domain modeling and validation","nanomanufacturing","nanostructure growth","physical mechanism selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Domain Model Building and Validation (CDMV): A New Modeling Strategy to Reinforce Understanding of Nanomanufacturing Processes","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6466395/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13599291","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Domain Model Building and Validation (CDMV): A New Modeling Strategy to Reinforce Understanding of Nanomanufacturing Processes","sourcePdf":"tase-huang-2243433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119107S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6549150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6549150","articleId":"6466395","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466396,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Kader Mustafa","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunication and Microelectronics, Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6587116/6466396/6466396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdul Kader Mustafa received the B.S. degree from North South University, Dhaka, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree from Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia, in 2011.","He was a Lecturer at James Cook University.

However, the non-linear operations for LINC separation lead to bandwidth expansion. The expanded bandwidth causes problems for the analog circuitry and effectively places a limit on the modulation bandwidth of the transmitted signal. We show that for multi-carrier signals, it is the phase component of the transmitted modulation that dominates the spectrum of the LINC components. A novel bandwidth reduction scheme is then proposed for these components. The scheme repetitively limits the bandwidth of the LINC components while inhibiting envelope variations. Measurements show a 46% bandwidth reduction while still meeting the WLAN spectrum mask. This implies an increase of 85% in the modulation bandwidth of the transmitted signal.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2246255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6587116/06466396.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2246255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6587116","startPage":"2502","endPage":"2510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Limitation for the Constant Envelope Components of an OFDM Signal in a LINC Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Limitation for the Constant Envelope Components of an OFDM Signal in a LINC Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13747752","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6466396/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Limitation for the Constant Envelope Components of an OFDM Signal in a LINC Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ahmed-2246255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065344S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6587116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6587116","articleId":"6466396","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6466397,"authors":[{"name":"Manohar Ayinala","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6587116/6466397/6466397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manohar Ayinala (S'10\u2013M'12) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India, in 2006 and the M.S. and Ph.D degrees from University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently with Intel Corporation, Allentown, PA, USA.

Using theories and techniques from continuum percolation and ergodicity, we analytically characterize the connectivity of the secondary network defined in terms of the almost sure finiteness of the multihop delay, and show the occurrence of a phase transition phenomenon while studying the impact of the temporal dynamics of the primary traffic on the connectivity of the secondary network. Specifically, as long as the primary traffic has some temporal dynamics caused by either mobility and/or changes in traffic load and pattern, the connectivity of the secondary network depends solely on its own density and is independent of the primary traffic; otherwise, the connectivity of the secondary network requires putting a density-dependent cap on the primary traffic load. We show that the scaling behavior of the multihop delay depends critically on whether or not the secondary network is instantaneously connected. In particular, we establish the scaling law of the minimum multihop delay with respect to the source-destination distance when the propagation delay is negligible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14111386","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466404/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Traffic Dynamics Improve the Connectivity of Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Traffic Dynamics Improve the Connectivity of Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-ren-2244612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15303S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6739138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6739138","articleId":"6466404","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6466422,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan K.

In this paper, we focus on a smart grid in which the demand-side comprises traditional users as well as users owning some kind of distributed energy source and/or energy storage device. By means of a day-ahead demand-side management mechanism regulated through an independent central unit, the latter users are interested in reducing their monetary expense by producing or storing energy rather than just purchasing their energy needs from the grid. Using a general energy pricing model, we tackle the grid optimization design from two different perspectives: a user-oriented optimization and an holistic-based design. In the former case, we optimize each user individually by formulating the grid optimization problem as a noncooperative game, whose solution analysis is addressed building on the theory of variational inequalities. In the latter case, we focus instead on the joint optimization of the whole system, allowing some cooperation among the users. For both formulations, we devise distributed and iterative algorithms providing the optimal production/storage strategies of the users, along with their convergence properties. Among all, the proposed algorithms preserve the users' privacy and require very limited signaling with the central unit.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6504823/06466429.pdf","startPage":"2454","endPage":"2472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2248002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2248002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncooperative and Cooperative Optimization of Distributed Energy Generation and Storage in the Demand-Side of the Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Optimization","Energy consumption","Energy storage","Games","Production","Pricing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Demand-side management","distributed pricing algorithm","game theory","proximal decomposition algorithm","smart grid","variational inequality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Noncooperative and Cooperative Optimization of Distributed Energy Generation and Storage in the Demand-Side of the Smart Grid","volume":"61","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncooperative and Cooperative Optimization of Distributed Energy Generation and Storage in the Demand-Side of the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsp-atzeni-2248002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067988S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"115","articleId":"6466429","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6466431,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We pose and prove the necessary conditions of linear IA feasibility for general MIMO-IBC. Except for the proper condition, we find another necessary condition to ensure a kind of irreducible interference to be eliminated. We then prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for a special class of MIMO-IBC, where the numbers of antennas are divisible by the number of data streams per user. Since finding an invertible Jacobian matrix is crucial for the sufficiency proof, we first analyze the impact of sparse structure and repeated structure of the Jacobian matrix. Considering that for the MIMO-IBC the sub-matrices of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the transmit and receive matrices have different repeated structure, we find an invertible Jacobian matrix by constructing the two sub-matrices separately. We show that for the MIMO-IBC where each user has one desired data stream, a proper system is feasible. For symmetric MIMO-IBC, we provide proper but infeasible region of antenna configurations by analyzing the difference between the necessary conditions and the sufficient conditions of linear IA feasibility.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6492148/06466434.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2248005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2248005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Feasibility of Linear Interference Alignment for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels With Constant Coefficients","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Interference","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Matrix converters","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","broadcast channels","interference suppression","Jacobian matrices","MIMO communication","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear interference alignment","MIMO interference broadcast channels","constant coefficients","multiinput-multioutput iinterference broadcast channel","linear IA feasibility","irreducible interference","necessary and sufficient conditions","data streams","invertible Jacobian matrix","sufficiency proof","sparse structure","repeated structure","submatrices","transmit matrix","receive matrix","symmetric MIMO-IBC","antenna configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degrees of freedom (DoF)","interference alignment feasibility","interference broadcast channel","multi-input\u2013multi-output (MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Feasibility of Linear Interference Alignment for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels With Constant Coefficients","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6466434/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13412992","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Feasibility of Linear Interference Alignment for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels With Constant Coefficients","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2248005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094318S","chronDate":"May1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6492148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6492148","articleId":"6466434","onlineDate":"20 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466439,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos H.

Aiming to improve coverage, cell-edge throughput, and overall system capacity, self-organizing solutions, such as range expansion bias, an almost blank subframe (ABS), and distributed antenna systems, are considered. Herein, stochastic geometry is used to model network deployments, whereas higher order statistics through the cumulants concept is utilized to characterize the probability distribution of received power and aggregate interference at the user of interest. A comprehensive analytical framework is introduced to evaluate the performance of such self-organizing networks in terms of outage probability and average channel capacity with respect to the tagged receiver. To conduct our studies, we consider a shadowed fading channel model incorporating lognormal shadowing and Nakagami-\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula>\n fading. Results show that the analytical framework matches well with numerical results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.

A good example of such a transformation is the German power system, where renewable energy sources (RESs) are now contributing 25% of the power needed to meet electricity demand, compared with 5% only 20 years ago. In particular, photovoltaic (PV) systems have been skyrocketing over the last couple of years. As of September 2012, about 1.2 million PV systems were installed, with a total installed peak capacity of more than 31 GWp. During some hours of 2012, PV already contributed about 40% of the peak power demand.

The first component addresses the robust identification of the candidate traffic signs in each frame of the video sequence. The second component discards the traffic sign candidates that do not comply with stringent shape constraints, and the last component implements the classification of the traffic signs using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The main novel elements of our TSR algorithm are given by the approach that has been developed for traffic sign classification and by the experimental evaluation that was employed to identify the optimal image attributes that are able to maximize the traffic sign classification performance. The TSR algorithm has been validated using video sequences that include the most important categories of signs that are used to regulate the traffic on the Irish and UK roads, and it achieved 87.6% sign detection, 99.2% traffic sign classification accuracy and 86.7% overall traffic sign recognition.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Shape","Image segmentation","Roads","Classification algorithms","Vehicles","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image recognition","image sequences","object detection","road traffic","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust algorithm","traffic sign detection","video data","imaging problems","motion artifacts","weather conditions","shadows","partial occlusion","video traffic sequences","moving vehicle","traffic sign recognition system","TSR systems","computational stages","robust identification","candidate traffic signs","traffic sign candidates","shape constraints","support vector machines","SVM","TSR algorithm","optimal image attributes","traffic sign classification performance","video sequences","traffic sign classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic signs","Color segmentation","Shape analysis","Image attributes","Support Vector Machines"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466568","startPage":"108","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459626/6466564/06466568.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust algorithm for detection and classification of traffic signs in video data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A robust algorithm for detection and classification of traffic signs in video data","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13371891","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6466568/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust algorithm for detection and classification of traffic signs in video data","confLoc":"Saigon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p108bui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054549S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459626","isNumber":"6466564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459626","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6466564","articleId":"6466568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6466579,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Khanh Quang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Nguyen Khanh","lastName":"Quang","id":"38509232600"},{"name":"Nguyen Trung Hieu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nguyen Trung","lastName":"Hieu","id":"38267717600"},{"name":"G.

The estimation of the rotor position and speed is achieved by using a parallel reduced-order Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to alleviate the need of physical sensors. Compared with the traditional method of EKF, the system order is reduced, the process of iteration of speed estimation algorithm is greatly simplified and it is easy to realize the digital system. To achieve this objective, a comparison is made between the parallel reduced-order EKF, full-order EKF and sliding mode observer (SMO). The developed controller has been implemented in a FPGA-based environment and the very high speed integrated circuit-hardware description language (VHDL) is adopted to describe advantageous features of the proposed control system. The validity of the approach is verified through simulation results based on the Modelsim/Simulink co-simulation method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based sensorless PMSM drive using parallel reduced-order Extended Kalman Filter","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466579","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459626/6466564/06466579.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based sensorless PMSM drive using parallel reduced-order Extended Kalman Filter","conferenceDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466579/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371902","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based sensorless PMSM drive using parallel reduced-order Extended Kalman Filter","confLoc":"Saigon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p164nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078895S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459626","isNumber":"6466564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459626","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6466564","articleId":"6466579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466580,"authors":[{"name":"Sayed A.

The advantages of these structures come from the use of semi-active devices for the fail safe operations and low energy consumption. However, the control of MR dampers is hindered by their nonlinear force-displacement and hysteresis force-velocity responses which usually affect control performance. On the other hand, the required yielding force to suppress structural vibrations results from the magnetization of the fluid particle suspension in the damper housing via the controlled current. To robustly control the dampers' magnetization current, the sliding mode control methodology is adopted.

In our proposed algorithm, at first, each transmitter in secondary networks receives the feedback information about signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) from its corresponding receiver. Based on the information, the transmitter derives the transmitted power with PID control in order to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) constraints in secondary networks. Then, the transmitter decides the actual transmitted power according to a constraint condition in addition to the derived power. This constraint condition is effective for avoiding the interference with primary networks. Since the constraint condition affects the performance of our proposed method significantly, we propose an effective update algorithm. In the update algorithm, the transmitter changes the constraint condition by comparing the derived transmitted power with both the maximum interference power tolerance and the target SINR. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm with simulation. Numerical examples show that our proposed algorithm is effective for the power control in cognitive radio networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466564","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459626/6466564/06466600.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power adjustment in cognitive radio networks using PID control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6466600/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power adjustment in cognitive radio networks using PID control","conferenceDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371923","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power adjustment in cognitive radio networks using PID control","confLoc":"Saigon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p265matsui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098435S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459626","isNumber":"6466564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459626","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466564","articleId":"6466600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6466603,"authors":[{"name":"Vinh Hao Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vinh Hao","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37290798400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0813-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0812-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0811-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466603","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Kalman filters","Data communication","Noise measurement","State estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","estimation theory","signal sampling","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","state estimation problem","network applying event-based sampling scheme","networked estimation problem","sensor data","level-crossing","send-on-delta","estimator node","sensor value","time-triggered method","bandwidth improvement","sampling method","sensor node","system state estimation","estimation performance","multirate filter","network bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the networked estimation problem in which sensor data are transmitted over the network. In the event-based sampling scheme known as level-crossing or send-on-delta, sensor data are transmitted to the estimator node if the difference between the current sensor value and the last transmitted one is greater than a given threshold. The event-based sampling has been shown to be more efficient than the time-triggered method in some situations, especially in the bandwidth improvement for networks. Motivated by this advantage, we propose a novel sampling method where the sensor node transmits data using event-based sampling scheme but the estimator node estimates the system states periodically. We then formulate a state estimation problem and analyze the estimation performance applying the proposed sampling scheme. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, we show that the proposed method introduces a better estimation performance than the multirate filter under the same network bandwidth. Therefore, when the proposed sampling scheme is applied, we get benefits from the network bandwidth improvement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466603","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459626/6466564/06466603.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"287","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of state estimation problem over network applying event-based sampling scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of state estimation problem over network applying event-based sampling scheme","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6466603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371926","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466603/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of state estimation problem over network applying event-based sampling scheme","confLoc":"Saigon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p283nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051608S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459626","isNumber":"6466564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459626","xplore-issue":"6466564","articleId":"6466603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6466616,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Trung Hieu","affiliation":["DCSELAB, Hochiminh City University of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Trung","lastName":"Hieu","id":"38267717600"},{"name":"Nguyen Thanh Tu","affiliation":["Hochiminh City University of Science, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Thanh","lastName":"Tu","id":"38551940200"},{"name":"Nguyen Viet Ha","affiliation":["Hochiminh City University of Science, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Viet","lastName":"Ha","id":"37085612880"},{"name":"Tran Thi Thao Nguyen","affiliation":["Hochiminh City University of Science, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tran Thi Thao","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086235434"},{"name":"Bui Huu Phu","affiliation":["DCSELAB, Hochiminh City University of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Bui Huu","lastName":"Phu","id":"37294397400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0813-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0812-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0811-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466616","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","MIMO","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Field programmable gate arrays","Modulation","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","diversity reception","fading channels","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","receiving antennas","space-time block codes","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","MIMO-OFDM STBC systems","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques","OFDM techniques","space-time block coding","diversity gain","hardware design","Simulink platform","DSP Simulink library","DSP builder library","FPGA Altera development KIT","Verilog HDL","Quartus II software","4QAM modulation","receiver antennas","MIMO multipath fading environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","STBC","MIMO","MIMO-OFDM","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466616","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466564","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459626/6466564/06466616.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of MIMO-OFDM STBC systems","abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques has been received a great attention in recent years.

Since the requirement for cooperation and dynamism increases with the new spectrum access approach, time synchronization is mandatory for ensuring the proper operation of CRNs. In this paper, we propose DCR-Sync, a novel time synchronization protocol for CRNs. Differently from existing proposals, DCR-Sync is fully distributed and resilient towards failure of root nodes, i.e., the nodes which play the role of master on the synchronization process. We present DCR-Sync in two versions. The first version is static in nature, and the second version can adapt dynamically to network changes. Through extensive simulations, we show that both versions outperform the performance of existing synchronization protocols. Precisely, both versions of DCR-Sync are simulated using NS2 simulator and are compared to the TPSN protocol. Simulation results show the improvements obtained by DCR-Sync in terms of network overhead and convergence time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GIIS.2012.6466661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466654","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Global Information Infrastructure and Networking Symposium (GIIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6461168/6466654/06466661.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reliable and distributed time synchronization for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6466661/","displayDocTitle":"A reliable and distributed time synchronization for Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13371970","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reliable and distributed time synchronization for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Choroni, Venezuela","sourcePdf":"1569669329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048095S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6461168","isNumber":"6466654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6461168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466654","articleId":"6466661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466675,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466675","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Routing","Design automation","Arrays","Pins","Optimization","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","bioMEMS","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design automation","digital microfluidic biochips","chip optimization","computer-aided-design tools","design complexity","bioassay operations","biochemical samples","nanoliter volumes","microliter","molecular biology","biochemistry"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466675","abstract":"Advances in droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have led to the emergence of biochips for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of microliter of nanoliter volumes of biochemical samples and reagents. They combine electronics with biology, and integrate various bioassay operations, such as sample preparation, analysis, separation, and detection. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis to chip-level design. Design automations are expected to relieve the design burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06466675.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466675","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design automation for digital microfluidic biochips: From fluidic-level toward chip-level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466675/","displayDocTitle":"Design automation for digital microfluidic biochips: From fluidic-level toward chip-level","htmlLink":"/document/6466675/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13356719","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design automation for digital microfluidic biochips: From fluidic-level toward chip-level","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S5201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078985S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6466675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466676,"authors":[{"name":"James Yingbo Jia","affiliation":["Microsemi Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James Yingbo","lastName":"Jia","id":"38237670300"},{"name":"Fethi Dhaoui","affiliation":["Microsemi Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fethi","lastName":"Dhaoui","id":"37403641600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466676","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Couplings","Logic gates","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Microprocessors","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupling ratio measurement","2T FPGA flash cell","2T cell architecture","voltage coupling","common floating gate","programming modes","read modes","source-drain overlaps"]}],"abstract":"In this study, a new method is proposed and implemented to measure the coupling ratios in a single 2-T FPGA Flash cell.

A certain memory density may be achieved by any array architecture but with different numbers of stacking layers. A smaller pitch allows the achieving of high density at reasonable number of stacked memory layers (\u2264 32) and thus potentially offers lower cost. VG NAND has good pitch scalability thus is very attractive. On the other hand, it is more difficult to decode the bit line in a VG architecture, thus decoding innovations are required for a compact array architecture design. This paper provides a systematic comparison of four different decoding methods of VG NAND.

Thereby the racetrack memory can be used as universal storage to address both embedded and standalone applications. In this paper, we present the device physics, integration circuit and architecture designs of a racetrack memory based on MTJs with PMA.

The power consumption of modulator is 90\u03bcW under 1.5V power supply.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466706","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06466706.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 90-\u03bcW 16 bit 20 KHz-BW feedforward double-sampled sigma-delta modulator in 0.18 CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A 90-\u03bcW 16 bit 20 KHz-BW feedforward double-sampled sigma-delta modulator in 0.18 CMOS","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466706/","accessionNumber":"13356749","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466706/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 90-\u03bcW 16 bit 20 KHz-BW feedforward double-sampled sigma-delta modulator in 0.18 CMOS","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S5801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058102S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6466706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6466713,"authors":[{"name":"Esteve Amat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Esteve","lastName":"Amat","id":"37317946000"},{"name":"Carmen G.

Compared with a conventional 2D mesh, REmesh, which employs a few more routers and multiplexers, can be easily reconfigured to restore a 2D mesh topology to tolerant core faults in NoCs. Based on REmesh, TRARE repeatedly categorizes routers, connects cores with routers, and eventually finds out a reconfiguration solution. Simulation results show that in the topologies which sizes do not exceed 7\u00d78, more than 90% successful reconfiguration rate can be guaranteed when less than 9% of the total cores are faulty. Simulation also suggests that when the number of faulty cores reaches the number of redundant cores, more redundancy should be added to ensure high successful reconfiguration rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of a reconfigurable 2D mesh network-on-chip architecture and a topology reconfiguration algorithm","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466732","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06466732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6466732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of a reconfigurable 2D mesh network-on-chip architecture and a topology reconfiguration algorithm","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466732/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356775","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of a reconfigurable 2D mesh network-on-chip architecture and a topology reconfiguration algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S3901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050291S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6466732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6466743,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaojiao Ou","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaojiao","lastName":"Ou","id":"38466344900"},{"name":"Ru Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Huang","id":"37273463400"},{"name":"Yuchao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuchao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655761700"},{"name":"Runsheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Runsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406140300"},{"name":"Yangyuan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangyuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281435300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6466743","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance investigation of SRAM cells based on gate-all-around (GAA) Si nanowire transistor for ultra-low voltage applications","abstract":"In this paper, the performance metrics (i.e., read and write margins, operation speed, power consumption) of 6T SRAM cell based on gate-all-around (GAA) Si nanowire transistor (SNWT) at 16nm technology node are investigated, as well as the impacts of device variations on GAA SNWT SRAM cells.

It can be estimated as the noise residual between the image content and its denoised version. However, the SPN extracted from a single image can be contaminated largely by image scene because image edge noise is usually much stronger than the SPN. So the identification performance is heavily dependent upon the purity of the estimated SPN, especially for small size images because they have less and weaker SPN. Although there are some existing works dedicated to improving the performance of source camera identification, an effective method to eliminate the contamination of image scene and extract an accurate SPN is currently lacking. In this paper, we will propose an edge adaptive SPN predictor based on context adaptive interpolation (PCAI) to exclude the contamination of image scene. Different from most of the existing methods extracting SPN from wavelet high frequency coefficients, we extract SPN directly from the spatial domain with a pixel-wise adaptive Wiener filter, based on the assumption that the SPN is a white signal. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PCAI method achieves the best receiver operating characteristic (ROC) performance among all of the state-of-the-art CSI schemes on different sizes of images, and has the best performance in resisting JPEG compression (e.g. with a quality factor of 90%) simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466839","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06466839.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A context adaptive predictor of sensor pattern noise for camera source identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466839/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A context adaptive predictor of sensor pattern noise for camera source identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466839/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13356484","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A context adaptive predictor of sensor pattern noise for camera source identification","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075706S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6466839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6466857,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Dimitriou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Dimitriou","id":"37089120134"},{"name":"Anastasios Delopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Delopoulos","id":"37374768800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6466857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Motion segmentation","Computer vision","Vectors","Clustering algorithms","Noise","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image segmentation","matrix algebra","video signal processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved motion segmentation","locally sampled subspace","video processing applications","affine camera model","local algorithm","4-subsets","ordered residual kernel","similarity measurement","FastMap","kernel matrix","dimensionality reduction technique","embedded vectors","affinity matrix","spectral clustering","Hopkins155 database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["motion segmentation","affine model","FastMap","Hopkins155"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466857","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06466857.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved motion segmentation using Locally sampled Subspaces","abstract":"Motion segmentation is an important component of various video processing applications.

paper presents a new method which uses graph embedding and foreground-background patch pairs to perform object tracking. We first use particle filter to sample some particles. Then we evaluate each particle based on graph embedding and foreground-background patch pairs. For each particle, we use a two-layer model to represent the object, i.e. the inner layer (object layer) and the outer layer (background layer). Both the two layers are divided into patches. We cluster the foreground patches to several classes. Each class forms one sample group pair with the background patches. We perform graph embedding on multiple sample group pairs to discriminate the foreground and the background. Experimental results showed that our method tracked the objects efficiently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6466876/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356520","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiple sample group pairs' graph embedding for tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple sample group pairs' graph embedding for tracking","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05091S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6466876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6466919,"authors":[{"name":"Daeyoung Kim","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38554175800"},{"name":"Kuk-jin Yoon","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kuk-jin","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38182036400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6466919","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":273},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466919","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Noise","Sensors","Image resolution","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image resolution","image sampling","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality depth map up-sampling","edge noise","range sensor","low-resolution depth maps","time-of-flight camera","Markov random field","error rate","mean absolute error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["depth","up-sampling","MRFs","ToF","KINECT"]}],"abstract":"A new method to up-sample low-resolution depth maps to high quality and high resolution is proposed.

The proposed method consists mainly of two steps: (1) construction of 3D structures by non-rigid registration and (2) an image-based rendering procedure. For seamless registration, we apply a thin plate spline-based deformation onto a 3D point cloud rather than a conventional rigid-body transformation which would result in inaccurate registration due to the low precision of depth measurements from a distance. For rendering, our approach first draws a non-rigidly registered point cloud onto a depth buffer in the GPU and then fills holes and removes noise. Finally, we project an RGB color image onto reconstructed 3D points using the projective texture technique. Since most of the procedures are implemented using programmable CPUs, our methods fit well with modern graphics hardware and therefore can accelerate computationally heavy processes. Experiments showed high-quality seamlessly rendered results of multiple RGB-D images compared with the previous point-based rendering and registration techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated view synthesis from multiple RGB-D images","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466924","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06466924.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6466924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated view synthesis from multiple RGB-D images","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6466924/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated view synthesis from multiple RGB-D images","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050283S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6466924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6466930,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Dong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Dong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38195318400"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595831200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6466930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"abstract":"In the field of face recognition, most existing preprocessing methods only try to filter the low frequency part of the spectrum of face images to eliminate illumination variations.

Each local histogram to be specified is learned by estimating the distribution of gray values in the corresponding local region of all normal lighting images in the training set. The proposed method is able to alleviate both the low and high frequency parts of illumination on face images as well as enhance face features lying in the low frequency part. Reasonable window size is also empirically studied.

Recently, synthesis sparsifying dictionaries that are directly adapted to the data have become popular in image processing. However, the idea of learning sparsifying transforms has received only little attention. We propose a novel problem formulation for learning doubly sparse transforms for signals or image patches. These transforms are a product of a fixed, fast analytic transform such as the DCT, and an adaptive matrix constrained to be sparse.

However, it has been eclipsed by the advent of more advanced physical or statistical methods, as well as complex learning based methods. Recently, a new independent line of work claims that the simple idea of using maximum pixel values is not as naive as it seems, but can also be made to perform very well via some manipulations. The bright areas of images can include highlights and specularity as well as white surfaces or light sources, and indeed all may be helpful in the illumination estimation process. In this paper, we define the White Patch Gamut as a new extension to the Gamut Mapping Colour Constancy method, comprising the bright pixels of the image. Adding new constraints based on the possible White Patch Gamut to the standard gamut mapping constraints, a new combined method outperforms gamut mapping methods as well as other wellknown colour constancy methods. The new constraints that are brought to bear are powerful, and indeed can be more discriminating than those in the original gamut mapping method itself.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466981","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06466981.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"804","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"White Patch Gamut Mapping Colour Constancy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6466981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"White Patch Gamut Mapping Colour Constancy","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13356620","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6466981/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"White Patch Gamut Mapping Colour Constancy","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062483S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6466981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6467003,"authors":[{"name":"Huihui Bai","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37287036100"},{"name":"Mengmeng Zhang","affiliation":["North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mengmeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406626500"},{"name":"Anhong Wang","affiliation":["Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Anhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37290539000"},{"name":"Yao Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37291007900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467003","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"abstract":"For many practical applications, stereo-paired video is an important special case of multiview video coding (MVC). This paper presents a novel framework of stereo video coding based on distributed compressive sensing, which also can be easily extended to MVC. According to distributed video coding (DVC) at the encoder the video sequences from each view can be compressed independently without any communications between the cameras while at the decoder the inter-view correlation can be exploited for quality enhancement. Furthermore, due to compressive sensing (CS) principles, low complexity at the encoder side can result in low power consumption in the cameras, which may be promising in wireless camera sensor network. Here, the joint dictionary is applied in compressive sensing, which can make good use of inter-view and temporal correlation for better reconstruction quality of convex optimization. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with better performance than other compared schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467003.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"892","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo video coding using distributed compressive sensing with joint dictionary","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Dictionaries","Joints","Decoding","Cameras","Correlation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convex programming","correlation methods","decoding","image reconstruction","image sequences","stereo image processing","video cameras","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo video coding","distributed compressive sensing","joint dictionary","stereo-paired video","multiview video coding","MVC","distributed video coding","DVC","encoder","video sequence","decoder","inter-view correlation","quality enhancement","CS","power consumption","camera","temporal correlation","reconstruction quality","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stereo video coding","distributed video coding","compressive sensing","joint dictionary"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Stereo video coding using distributed compressive sensing with joint dictionary","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356642","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo video coding using distributed compressive sensing with joint dictionary","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045604S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6467004,"authors":[{"name":"Dao Lam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Dao","lastName":"Lam","id":"38553883200"},{"name":"Donald Wunsch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Wunsch","id":"37298522600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467004","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Wavelet transforms","Volume measurement","Image coding","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image sampling","image sequences","video coding","video streaming","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video compressive sensing","3D wavelet","3D noiselet","compressive video sampling method","video stream frames","fast reconstruction algorithms","video stream quality maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Wavelet","Noiselet","\u21131-norm","video coding"]}],"abstract":"A new compressive video sampling method is investigated.

The proposed method adopted the sampling with replacement in bootstrapping to extract L signals from the mixture. The extracted L signals from the ensemble of signals corrupted by Gaussian noise with the same mean and variance. The signals have different bases; thus, they he in different space. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Partially Known Support (OMP-PKS) is applied to reconstruct the L signals to the same sparse space. Gaussian noise is reduced by averaging the reconstructed signals. The performance of the proposed method was compared with Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN), OMP-PKS and Distributed Compressed Sensing using Simultaneously Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DCS-SOMP).

computer vision problem with applications in photometric stereo and shape-from-shading. In the case of morphologically complex surfaces observed in the presence of shadowing and transparency artifacts, a relatively large number of gradient measurements may be required for accurate surface reconstruction. Consequently, due to hardware limitations of image acquisition devices, situations are possible in which the available sampling density might not be sufficiently high to allow for recovery of essential surface details. In this paper, the above problem is resolved by means of derivative compressed sensing (DCS). DCS can be viewed as a modification of the classical compressed sensing (CS), which is particularly suited for reconstructions involving image/surface gradients. We demonstrate that using DCS results in substantial data savings as compared to the standard (dense) sampling, while producing estimates of higher accuracy and smaller variability, as compared to CS-base estimates. The results of this study are further supported by a series of numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467009","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient-based surface reconstruction using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gradient-based surface reconstruction using compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467009/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356648","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6467009/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient-based surface reconstruction using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045874S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6467010,"authors":[{"name":"Yoann Le Montagner","affiliation":["Institut Pasteur, CNRS URA 2582, Unit\u00e9 d'Analyse d'Image Quantitative, Paris, France","Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, CNRS LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Le Montagner","id":"38286222300"},{"name":"Elsa Angelini","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, CNRS LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Angelini","id":"37289124100"},{"name":"Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin","affiliation":["Institut Pasteur, CNRS URA 2582, Unit\u00e9 d'Analyse d'Image Quantitative, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Christophe","lastName":"Olivo-Marin","id":"38551815500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467010","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","TV","Image coding","PSNR","Dictionaries","Compressed sensing","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image sampling","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video reconstruction","compressed sensing measurement","3D total variation regularization","bioimaging application","pseudo-random linear measurement","nonlinear reconstruction","structured signal sampling","structured signal recovery","2D image recovery","joint reconstruction","time-correlated 2D image sequence","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","total variation","video"]}],"abstract":"The theory of compressed sensing (CS) predicts that random (or pseudo-random) linear measurements together with non-linear reconstruction can be used to sample and recover structured signals in a compressive manner.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances images efficiently in terms of both objective quality and subjective quality.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467022","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"965","endPage":"968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467022.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Vectors","Equations","Optimization","Aggregates","Approximation algorithms","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image representation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered difference representation-based contrast enhancement","gray-level differences","tree-like structure","output image","constrained optimization problem","transformation function","image enhancement algorithm","objective quality","subjective quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contrast enhancement","layered difference representation","histogram equalization","and constrained optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Contrast enhancement based on layered difference representation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467022/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467022/","accessionNumber":"13356661","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrast enhancement based on layered difference representation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039736S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":6467046,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Moreover, in real environments the source nodes monitor different scenes that may be of dissimilar importance. Hence a higher end-to-end quality is demanded for those nodes that are assigned a higher priority. Overall, each node has different power and resource requirements, and therefore a global optimization approach is required.

From event detection point of view, traditional video coding schemes such as H.264 are inefficient as they ignore the \u201cmeaning\u201d of video content and thus waste many bits to convey irrelevant information. To take advantage of the powerful computing resource on cameras, we propose a novel event-driven video coding scheme. Unlike previous approach that attempts to find anomalous image frame with potential events, we propose to detect salient regions in each image and transmit the image fragments marked with saliency to the receiver. This scheme rarely drops an event as it transmits all image fragments with potential events, and also requires no training procedure.

To this end, we adopt the so-called Joint-Detection-Estimation (JDE) framework introduced in [1] and augmented in [2]. An inherent difficulty is to find the right spatial scale at which brain hemodynamics estimation makes sense. The voxel level is clearly not appropriate as estimating a full hemodynamic response function (HRF) from a single voxel time course may suffer from a poor signal-to-noise-ratio and lead to potentially misleading results (non-physiological HRF shapes). More robust estimation can be obtained by considering groups of voxels (i.e. parcels) with some functional homogeneity properties. Current JDE approaches are therefore based on an initial parcellation but with no guarantee of its optimality or goodness. In this work, we propose a joint parcellation-detection-estimation (JPDE) procedure that incorporates an additional parcel estimation step solving this way both the parcellation choice and robust HRF estimation issues. As in [3], inference is carried out in a Bayesian setting using variational approximation techniques for computational efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Hidden Markov models","Brain modeling","Joints","Hemodynamics","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","biomedical MRI","brain","medical image processing","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust voxel-wise joint detection estimation framework","brain activity","functional MRI data","JDE framework","brain hemodynamics estimation","hemodynamic response function","HRF","single voxel time course","initial parcellation","parcel estimation step","Bayesian setting","using variational approximation techniques","JPDE procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variational EM","MRF","Biomedical signal detection","Magnetic resonance imaging"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467099","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1276","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467099.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust voxel-wise joint detection estimation of brain activity in fMRI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust voxel-wise joint detection estimation of brain activity in fMRI","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13367708","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6467099/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust voxel-wise joint detection estimation of brain activity in fMRI","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047195S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6467105,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"38468780500"},{"name":"Gene Cheung","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics"],"firstName":"Gene","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37269486500"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["West Virginia University, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280864900"},{"name":"Oscar Au","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Au","id":"37271414400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467105","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":509},"abstract":"Depth map compression is important for efficient network transmission of 3D visual data in texture-plus-depth format, where the observer can synthesize an image of a freely chosen viewpoint via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) using received neighboring texture and depth maps as anchors. Unlike texture maps, depth maps exhibit unique characteristics like smooth interior surfaces and sharp edges that can be exploited for coding gain. In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution approach to depth map compression using previously proposed graph-based transform (GBT). The key idea is to treat smooth surfaces and sharp edges of large code blocks separately and encode them in different resolutions: encode edges in original high resolution (HR) to preserve sharpness, and encode smooth surfaces in low-pass-filtered and down-sampled low resolution (LR) to save coding bits. Because GBT does not filter across edges, it produces small or zero high-frequency components when coding smooth-surface depth maps and leads to a compact representation in the transform domain. By encoding down-sampled surface regions in LR GBT, we achieve representation compactness for a large block without the high computation complexity associated with an adaptive large-block GBT. At the decoder, encoded LR surfaces are up-sampled and interpolated while preserving encoded HR edges. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-resolution approach using GBT reduced bitrate by 68% compared to native H.264 intra with DCT encoding original HR depth maps, and by 55% compared to single-resolution GBT encoding small blocks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467105.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1300","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth map compression using multi-resolution graph-based transform for depth-image-based rendering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image edge detection","Transforms","Image coding","Decoding","Interpolation","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","graph theory","image coding","image resolution","image texture","interpolation","low-pass filters","rendering (computer graphics)","smoothing methods","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution graph-based transform","3D visual data network transmission","texture-plus-depth format","image synthesis","depth-image-based rendering","DIBR","texture maps","depth map compression","code block smooth surface-encoding","high-resolution code block sharp-edge encoding","sharpness preservation","low-pass-filtered-down-sampled low-resolution encoding","coding bit saving","high-frequency components","smooth-surface depth map coding gain","transform domain compact representation","LR GBT","adaptive large-block GBT","decoders","encoded LR surface up-sampling","encoded LR surface interpolation","encoded HR edge preservation","bitrate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth map coding","multi-resolution","graph-based transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Depth map compression using multi-resolution graph-based transform for depth-image-based rendering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467105/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367714","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth map compression using multi-resolution graph-based transform for depth-image-based rendering","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058263S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6467149,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406079100"},{"name":"Hongyu Li","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37067565900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467149","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":687},"abstract":"Automatic image quality assessment (IQA) attempts to use computational models to measure the image quality in consistency with subjective ratings. In the past decades, dozens of IQA models have been proposed. Though some of them can predict subjective image quality accurately, their computational costs are usually very high. To meet real-time requirements, in this paper, we propose a novel fast and effective IQA index, namely spectral residual based similarity (SR-SIM), based on a specific visual saliency model, spectral residual visual saliency. SR-SIM is designed based on the hypothesis that an image's visual saliency map is closely related to its perceived quality. Extensive experiments conducted on three large-scale IQA datasets indicate that SR-SIM could achieve better prediction performance than the other state-of-the-art IQA indices evaluated. Moreover, SR-SIM can have a quite low computational complexity.

To match point spread functions (PSFs) between images of the same field taken at different times a convolution technique is used. Particularly suitable for large-scale images is a computationally intensive spatially-varying kernel. The underlying algorithm is inherently massively parallel due to unique kernel generation at every pixel location. The spatially-varying kernel cannot be efficiently computed through the Convolution Theorem, and thus does not lend itself to acceleration by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This work presents results of accelerated implementation of the spatially-varying kernel image convolution in multi-cores with OpenMP and graphic processing units (GPUs). Typical speedups over ANSI-C were a factor of 50 and a factor of 1000 over the initial IDL implementation, demonstrating that the techniques are a practical and high impact path to terabyte-per-night image pipelines and petascale processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367803","htmlLink":"/document/6467202/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GPU acceleration of image convolution using spatially-varying kernel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU acceleration of image convolution using spatially-varying kernel","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038194S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6467204,"authors":[{"name":"Eduarda Monteiro","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduarda","lastName":"Monteiro","id":"38235969700"},{"name":"Marilena Maule","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marilena","lastName":"Maule","id":"37847352800"},{"name":"Felipe Sampaio","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Sampaio","id":"37394596800"},{"name":"Cl\u00e1udio Diniz","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e1udio","lastName":"Diniz","id":"37550679100"},{"name":"Bruno Zatt","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Zatt","id":"37295620700"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["Informatics Institute-PPGC-PGMICRO, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467204","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"abstract":"This work presents an efficient method to map Motion Estimation (ME) algorithms onto General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) architectures using CUDA programming model.

LRBP is inspired by the fact that the shape of a face photo and its corresponding sketch is similar, even when the sketch is exaggerated by an artist. Therefore, the shape of face can be exploited to compute features which are robust against modality differences between face photo and sketch. In LRBP framework, the characteristics of face shape are captured by transforming face image into Radon space. Then, micro-information of face shape in new space is encoded by Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Finally, LRBP is computed by concatenating histograms of local LBPs. In order to capture both local and global characteristics of face shape, LRBP is extracted in a spatial pyramid fashion. Experiments on CUFS and CUFSF datasets indicate the efficiency of LRBP for face sketch recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image

The state-of-the-art reranking methods for CBIR are mainly based on spatial verification and global feature. To mine the complementary properties of different reranking strategies, we combine features representing images from different perspectives with RankSVM to obtain a reranking model to refine the initial ranking list. Besides, compared with traditional spatial verification based methods which measure image similarity only with single inlier's statistical properties, we bind close inlier visual words together to mine more geometric information from images. Through organizing inliers into sequence and computing the relative positions among inliers, we define an efficient similarity measurement with the order consistency between inlier sequences. Experimental results on both Oxford and imageNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed reranking method is effective and promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6467264/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367859","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to rerank images with enhanced spatial verification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to rerank images with enhanced spatial verification","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060547S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6467268,"authors":[{"name":"Yongming Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Chen","id":"38552339300"},{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38555667200"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280461100"},{"name":"Zhang Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38552743700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467268","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Switches","Logistics","Multimedia communication","Internet","Media","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","correlation methods","image classification","Internet","multimedia computing","regression analysis","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-modal multimedia retrieval experiments","canonical correlation analysis","CCA","information dissipation","continuum regression model","fixed variance coefficient","multinomial logistic regression model","retrieval precision","real Internet search applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Canonical correlation analysis","continuum regression","partial least squares regression","cross-modal retrieval"]}],"abstract":"Understanding the relationship among different modalities is a challenging task. The frequently used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants have proved effective for building a common space in which the correlation between different modalities is maximized. In this paper, we show that CCA and its variants may cause information dissipation when switching the modals, and thus propose to use the continuum regression (CR) model to handle this problem. In particular, the CR model with a fixed variance coefficient of 1/2 is adopted here. We also apply the multinomial logistic regression model for further classification task. To evaluate the CR model, we perform a series of cross-modal retrieval experiments in terms of two kinds of modals, namely image and text. Compared with previous methods, experimental results show that the CR model has achieved the best retrieval precision, which demonstrates the potential of our method for real internet search applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467268","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","startPage":"1949","endPage":"1952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuum regression for cross-modal multimedia retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Continuum regression for cross-modal multimedia retrieval","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467268/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367863","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6467268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuum regression for cross-modal multimedia retrieval","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062765S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6467292,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrasekhar Bhagavatula","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chandrasekhar","lastName":"Bhagavatula","id":"38507062800"},{"name":"Aaron Jaech","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Jaech","id":"38506592100"},{"name":"Marios Savvides","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Savvides","id":"37272021900"},{"name":"Vijayakumar Bhagavatula","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijayakumar","lastName":"Bhagavatula","id":"37325864300"},{"name":"Robert Friedman","affiliation":["Non-Invasive Medical Technologies, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Friedman","id":"38235422100"},{"name":"Rebecca Blue","affiliation":["University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Blue","id":"38027110100"},{"name":"Marc O Griofa","affiliation":["University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Marc O","lastName":"Griofa","id":"38015950600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467292","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Heart beat","Continuous wavelet transforms","Electrocardiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cepstral analysis","electrocardiography","haemodynamics","medical signal processing","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic cardiosynchronous waveform segmentation","cepstral analysis","continuous wavelet transforms","cardiosynchronous signal","radio frequency impedance interrogation","RFII signal","noninvasive method","hemodynamics monitoring","combat triage","biometric identification","heart beat cycle","fiducial point identification","fiducial point location","high temporal resolution","average heart rate estimation","time-frequency spectrum","electrocardiogram signals","ECG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical","Biometrics","ECG","RFII","Wavelets"]}],"abstract":"The cardiosynchronous signal obtained through Radio Frequency Impedance Interrogation (RFII) is a non-invasive method for monitoring hemodynamics with potential applications in combat triage and biometric identification.

By scheduling scalable video layers over MIMO antennas with different signal strength, the video layers are transmitted with un-equal error protections. Considering layer dependencies and various antenna conditions, it is a non-linear combinatorial problem for AS to minimize the overall end-to-end distortion. To find the optimal solution with low complexity, a cross-entropy based solution, named CEBAS, is proposed. All solutions are indexed by unique binary strings, and the primal problem is reformulated to a binary combination problem. Then, random strings are generated using the probability distribution of solutions, which is updated by the cross-entropy optimization method. The feasibility of solution is guaranteed by our proposed projection strategy. CEBAS is iterative in nature and converges to the global optimum in probability. Simulation results reveal both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. When comparing CEBAS against other existing algorithms, consistent superior performance has been observed.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467339","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467339.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-entropy based antenna selection for scalable video streaming over MIMO wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-entropy based antenna selection for scalable video streaming over MIMO wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467339/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367934","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6467339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-entropy based antenna selection for scalable video streaming over MIMO wireless networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060647S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6467350,"authors":[{"name":"Xinggong Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science & Technology, Peking University, Beijing, P.R.

In this paper, a joint source-channel coding and antenna mapping scheme for scalable video transmission over MIMO systems is proposed. Bandwidth are elaborately allocated between video source and channel protections by layer extracting and FEC coding. For the extracted layers, we determine i) which antenna will they be transmitted over and ii) how much redundancy bits will be added for error protections. We formulate this scheme into a non-linear integer optimization problem, whose complexity is very high. Instead, a low-complexity branch-and-bound algorithm is presented. Source layers are partitioned into subsets of layers, and the selected layer are mapped to antennas using Min-max scheduling algorithm. By branching and pruning, the computation complexity are reduced significantly. We carry out extensive numerical experiments under various network conditions. The results demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency and the overall transmission quality is improved significantly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel JSCC scheme for scalable video transmission over MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467350","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467350.pdf","startPage":"2277","endPage":"2280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel JSCC scheme for scalable video transmission over MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467350/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13367945","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel JSCC scheme for scalable video transmission over MIMO systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075033S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6467355,"authors":[{"name":"Bae-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bae-Hyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38552255400"},{"name":"Seungheun Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungheun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38552183400"},{"name":"Youngil Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngil","lastName":"Kim","id":"38553093300"},{"name":"Kyungil Cho","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungil","lastName":"Cho","id":"38549951800"},{"name":"Dongwook Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwook","lastName":"Kim","id":"38554174800"},{"name":"Jongkeun Song","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongkeun","lastName":"Song","id":"38555233000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467355","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Transducers","Array signal processing","Apertures","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniaturized real-time volumetric ultrasound scanners","full-sampled array beamformation","computer simulation","miniaturized volumetric ultrasound imaging scanners","2D array scanning method","medical image system","hybrid beam formation method","system complexity","spatial resolution","firing events","front-end electronics","system channels","manipulating massive ultrasound data","real-time 3D ultrasound imaging","2D array transducers","volumetric ultrasound imaging scanners"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Hybrid beamforming","2-D array transducer","Ultrasound scanner","Phased array system"]}],"abstract":"In real-time 3-D ultrasound imaging using 2-D array transducers, manipulating massive ultrasound data acquired from a large number of system channels is a challenge as is interconnecting hundreds or thousands of elements of 2-D array with the imaging system's front-end electronics.

By adaptively changing the downsampling rate, we can control the injected redundancy in the sub-band signals. Thus, we can modify the level of signal protection based on the importance of different parts of the signal or variations in the condition of the channel. This can be used in protection of Region of Interests (ROI) in image/video coding and can also be considered as some form of puncturing. Here, using time-domain analysis, we will provide sufficient conditions on OFB structure to perfectly reconstruct the output.

In this paper, we formulate the solution of NMF by performing EE and AE iteratively. Based on our previous Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) based AE algorithm, an HNN is also constructed for EE to solve the multiplicative updating problem of NMF for SMA. As a result, SMA is conducted in an unsupervised manner and our algorithm is able to extract virtual endmembers without assuming the presence of spectrally pure constituents in hyperspectral scenes.

Conventional Fourier-transform-based SAR processing techniques are not fit to remove ghosting effects prior to image formation due to the non-stationary nature of the returned signals from vibrating objects. Recently, a method based on the discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) has been developed for estimating the instantaneous vibration accelerations and vibrating frequencies from returned SAR signals. Here, a novel image de-ghosting algorithm for vibrating targets in SAR imagery is proposed by employing the DFrFT-based vibration-estimation algorithm. The proposed de-ghosting method is applied to SAR data collected by the Lynx SAR system. Experimental results show a substantial reduction in ghosting caused by a 1.5-cm amplitude, 0.8-Hz vibration present in a test target.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International

First, a novel high-frequency feature based on optical flow (HFOF) is introduced. It can well capture the dynamic information of optical flow. Besides, we adopt the other two types of features, namely multi-scale histogram of optical(MHOF), and dynamic textures (DT). MHOF reserves the motion direction information, while DT captures appearance variant property. The three types of features can complement each other in modeling crowd motions. Finally, multiple kernel learning (MKL) is adopted to train a classifier for anomaly detection. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset of escaping scenarios from University of Minnesota and a challenging dataset from Internet. The results of comparative experiments show the promising performance against other related work.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467457","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467457.pdf","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in crowded scene via appearance and dynamics joint modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467457/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in crowded scene via appearance and dynamics joint modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13368047","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467457/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in crowded scene via appearance and dynamics joint modeling","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055036S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6467481,"authors":[{"name":"Hi\u00eap Quang Luong","affiliation":["TELIN-IPI-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hi\u00eap Quang","lastName":"Luong","id":"37398058800"},{"name":"Bart Goossens","affiliation":["TELIN-IPI-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Goossens","id":"37295130200"},{"name":"Jan Aelterman","affiliation":["TELIN-IPI-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Aelterman","id":"37396105900"},{"name":"Aleksandra Pi\u017eurica","affiliation":["TELIN-IPI-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pi\u017eurica","id":"37295254100"},{"name":"Wilfried Philips","affiliation":["TELIN-IPI-IBBT, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Philips","id":"37265643400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A primal-dual algorithm for joint demosaicking and deconvolution","abstract":"In this paper, we present a first-order primal-dual algorithm for tackling the joint demosaicking and deconvolution problem. The proposed algorithm exploits the sparsity of both discrete gradient (TV) and shearlet coefficients as prior knowledge. In order to deal with this sparsity across the color channels, we first decorrelate the signals in color space before sparsifying them spatially, resulting in a separable transform. We demonstrate that this approach yields better results than employing group sparsity strategies. We propose to update the decorrelation operator during the image reconstruction, this approach will result in a significant improvement in PSNR. By relaxing the sparsity of the chrominance signals, we obtain both better objective and subjective image quality compared to other state-of-the-art demosaicking and deconvolution algorithms. Also, color artifacts due to demosaicking are suppressed very well.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6451323/6466779/06467481.pdf","startPage":"2801","endPage":"2804","publicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467481","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467481","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467481","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Transforms","Deconvolution","Joints","Decorrelation","PSNR","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","filtering theory","gradient methods","image colour analysis","image reconstruction","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chrominance signals","color filter array","subjective image quality","objective image quality","color artifacts suppression","peak signal-to-noise ratio","PSNR","image reconstruction","color space","signal decorrelation","color channels","shearlet coefficients","discrete gradient coefficients","joint deconvolution problem","joint demosaicking problem","first-order primal-dual algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Demosaicking","deconvolution","shearlets","sparsity","primal-dual algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467481/","displayDocTitle":"A primal-dual algorithm for joint demosaicking and deconvolution","accessionNumber":"13368070","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6467481/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A primal-dual algorithm for joint demosaicking and deconvolution","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054764S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451323","isNumber":"6466779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451323","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6466779","articleId":"6467481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6467512,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Dong","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications Company, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Dong","id":"37394133700"},{"name":"Yan Ye","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications Company, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085498465"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2533-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2532-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"6467512","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":264},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Encoding","Video coding","Filtering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","High definition video","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","high definition video","image sampling","performance evaluation","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive downsampling","high-definition video coding","decoding","encoding","rate-distortion performance improvement","optimal downsampling ratio","optimal R-D performance","up-sampling"]}],"abstract":"Previous research has shown that downsampling prior to encoding and upsampling after decoding can improve the rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared with directly coding the original video using standard coding technologies, e.g., JPEG and H.264/AVC, especially at low bit rates.

theory is widely adopted to interpret the process of conductive filaments (CF) formation and rupture in electrolyte based resistive switching memory. However, this theory generally suit the situation of fast ionic mobility. For material system with low ionic mobility, there exist some controversies with the conventional electrochemical metallization theory. In this work, we performed real-time characterization of resistive switching in binary oxide electrolyte based RRAM. We found the CF was grown from the anode instead of the cathode.

First we designed the filter by using Silicon-based CMOS Operational Amplifiers (Si-OPAMPs). Then we designed the filter with Carbon Nanotube-based Operational Amplifiers (CNT-OPAMPs) using a benchmark nine-transistor Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) model with single-walled Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (SW-CNTFETs) as primary building-blocks for 32nm technology. We compared the performance between the two and achieved higher phase margin, improved power dissipation, and significantly low output resistance for the CNT-OPAMP based filter. Then we further evaluated the performance of the CNT-OPAMP based filter by changing the number of SWNTs used for making each of the CNTFET, keeping all other design parameters the same. Our simulation-based assessment has shown a satisfactory superiority for CNT-OPAMP filter design in comparison with Si-based CMOS filter design. The results obtained suggest that the CNT-OPAMP has a promising potential for low-power, highspeed applications in both analog and mixed-signal nanoelectronic circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467737","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06467737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a 32-nm CNT-OPAMP in analog circuits: Design and comparison of Elliptical filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a 32-nm CNT-OPAMP in analog circuits: Design and comparison of Elliptical filters","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467737/","accessionNumber":"13356962","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a 32-nm CNT-OPAMP in analog circuits: Design and comparison of Elliptical filters","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046336S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6467737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6467751,"authors":[{"name":"Minjie Lv","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Minjie","lastName":"Lv","id":"38551356600"},{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596251500"},{"name":"Tai Min","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Tai","lastName":"Min","id":"37303168000"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECSE, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6467751","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467751","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Memory management","Random access memory","Design methodology","Mobile communication","Magnetic tunneling","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","magnetoelectronics","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous design methodology","mobile SoC","spin-torque transfer random access memory","universal memory","system-on-chip","structure design techniques","STT-RAM based memory system","Cacti 6.5 simulator","SimpleScalar simulator"]}],"abstract":"Spin-torque transfer random access memory (STT-RAM) has emerged as a potential candidate for universal memory.

The RC-triggered silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is widely studied for the high turn-on efficiency and discharge capability. However, the large gate leakage current of MOS capacitor in the traditional RC network in nanoscale process is not desired. In this work, a modified detection circuit with feedback technique is proposed. The leakage current is reduced to 16 nA at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). Under the ESD event, it injects 38 mA trigger current into the p-substrate of SCR.

The simulation result shows that this clamp circuit can be used in industry.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharges","Leakage current","Clamps","Logic

The simulated results of the SNM, the power consumption, the propagation delay and the power delay product (PDP) are compared between the dynamic power 6T SRAM cell and the proposed 8T SRAM cell.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06467901.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467901","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel asymmetric 8T SRAM cell with dynamic power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel asymmetric 8T SRAM cell with dynamic power","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467901/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6467901/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13357114","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel asymmetric 8T SRAM cell with dynamic power","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120846S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6467901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6467902,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Yuan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Information, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuan-Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38551759700"},{"name":"Zi-Ou Wang","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zi-Ou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404921000"},{"name":"Li-Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li-Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406074300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6467902","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage current","Power demand","Noise","Transistors","SRAM cells","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","CMOS integrated circuits","leakage currents","low-power electronics","nanoelectronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power cache design","6-transistor SRAM cell","static random access memory","power consumption","power dissipation","write operation","read operation","nanoscale technology","low power application","CMOS technology","complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology","leakage current","positive feedback","nanoscale SRAM","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"Power consumption is becoming a pressing issue in cache design. And SRAM (static random access memory) cells occupy a large area of the cache. Recent research shows that SRAM's power dissipation contributes to a key part of the whole chip power consumption. By using separate write and read operation, this paper presents a new 6T-SRAM cell structure of nano-scale technology for low power application. Simulation results with standard 65nm CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology show that the speed is closed to the traditional 6T cell, power consumption is reduced by 22.45% during the write operation of 0. Particularly, in idle mode this structure maintains its data with the help of leakage current and positive feedback, which can greatly improves the power consumption of the nano-scale SRAM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new 6-transistor SRAM cell for low power cache design","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467902","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2012.6467902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466666","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459619/6466666/06467902.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6467902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6467902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new 6-transistor SRAM cell for low power cache design","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6467902/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13357115","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new 6-transistor SRAM cell for low power cache design","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050978S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459619","isNumber":"6466666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459619","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6466666","articleId":"6467902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6467950,"authors":[{"name":"Xifan Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Xifan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086662060"},{"name":"Lingli Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Lingli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086663089"},{"name":"Hu Xu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Integrated System, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37714034100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2474-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2473-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6467950","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit modeling","Transistors","Routing","Estimation","Mathematical model","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","network routing","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA routing resources","accurate dynamic power model","power modeling techniques","ASIC","MUXes","power estimation","pass transistor chains"]}],"abstract":"Accurately modeling the dynamic power of FPGAs is a challenging task due to the changeable functionality and a large number of pass transistors.

We introduce an enhanced structure preserving oversampling (ESPO) technique and synergistically combine it with interpolation-based oversampling. ESPO is used to generate a large percentage of the synthetic minority samples based on multivariate Gaussian distribution, by estimating the covariance structure of the minority-class samples and by regularizing the unreliable eigen spectrum. To protect the key original minority samples, we use an interpolation-based technique to oversample a small percentage of synthetic population. By preserving the main covariance structure and intelligently creating protective variances in the trivial eigen dimensions, ESPO effectively expands the synthetic samples into the void area in the data space without being too closely tied with existing minority-class samples. This also addresses a key challenge for applying oversampling for imbalanced time series classification, i.e., maintaining the correlation between consecutive values through preserving the main covariance structure. Extensive experiments based on seven public time series data sets demonstrate that our INOS approach, used with support vector machines (SVM), achieved better performance over existing oversampling methods as well as state-of-the-art methods in time series classification.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6648553/06468038.pdf","startPage":"2809","endPage":"2822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Oversampling for Imbalanced Time Series Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Null space","Covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sampling methods","Support vector machines","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","Gaussian distribution","interpolation","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated oversampling method","INOS","imbalanced time series classification","enhanced structure preserving oversampling technique","ESPO","interpolation-based oversampling","multivariate Gaussian distribution","covariance structure estimation","minority-class samples","eigen spectrum","data space","support vector machines","SVM","time series data sets","machine learning","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oversampling","learning","imbalanced data","time series","SVM","structure preserving","classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Oversampling for Imbalanced Time Series Classification","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6468038/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13875727","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Oversampling for Imbalanced Time Series Classification","sourcePdf":"ttk2013122809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100354S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6648553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6648553","articleId":"6468038","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6468041,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Sigg","affiliation":["Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division, National Institute of Informatics, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6763180/6468041/6468041-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stephan Sigg is with the Georg-August University Goettingen.

Since environmental changes impact the transmission channel between devices, the detection of this alteration can be used to classify environmental situations. We identify relevant features to detect activities of non-actively transmitting subjects. In particular, we distinguish with high accuracy an empty environment or a walking, lying, crawling or standing person, in case-studies of an active, device-free activity recognition system with software defined radios. We distinguish between two cases in which the transmitter is either under the control of the system or ambient. For activity detection the application of one-stage and two-stage classifiers is considered. Apart from the discrimination of the above activities, we can show that a detected activity can also be localized simultaneously within an area of less than 1 meter radius.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Accuracy","Monitoring","Radio transmitters","Wireless communication","Transceivers","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio transmitters","signal detection","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF-sensing","activity detection","radio frequency channel","software defined radio","radio transmitter","one-stage classifier","two-stage classifier","local signals","ambient signals","device-free recognition systems","noncooperative subjects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pervasive computing","signal analysis","synthesis","and processing","signal processing","location-dependent and sensitive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468041","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.28","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6763180/06468041.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.28","startPage":"907","endPage":"920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6763180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF-Sensing of Activities from Non-Cooperative Subjects in Device-Free Recognition Systems Using Ambient and Local Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF-Sensing of Activities from Non-Cooperative Subjects in Device-Free Recognition Systems Using Ambient and Local Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468041/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6468041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14156902","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-Sensing of Activities from Non-Cooperative Subjects in Device-Free Recognition Systems Using Ambient and Local Signals","sourcePdf":"tmc-sigg-28-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159688S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6763180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"6763180","articleId":"6468041","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468044,"authors":[{"name":"Hassen Drira","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique, (UMR 8022), Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, TELECOM Lille 1, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6560338/6468044/6468044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassen Drira received the engineering and MSc degrees in computer science from the National School of Computer Science, Manouba, Tunisia, in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Lille 1, France, in 2011.

Here we represent facial surfaces by radial curves emanating from the nose tips and use elastic shape analysis of these curves to develop a Riemannian framework for analyzing shapes of full facial surfaces. This representation, along with the elastic Riemannian metric, seems natural for measuring facial deformations and is robust to challenges such as large facial expressions (especially those with open mouths), large pose variations, missing parts, and partial occlusions due to glasses, hair, and so on. This framework is shown to be promising from both-empirical and theoretical-perspectives. In terms of the empirical evaluation, our results match or improve upon the state-of-the-art methods on three prominent databases: FRGCv2, GavabDB, and Bosphorus, each posing a different type of challenge. From a theoretical perspective, this framework allows for formal statistical inferences, such as the estimation of missing facial parts using PCA on tangent spaces and computing average shapes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6560338/06468044.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition under Expressions, Occlusions, and Pose Variations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Shape","Face recognition","Nose","Mouth","Probes","Lips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","inference mechanisms","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","expression","occlusion","pose variation","geometric framework","3D face analysis","facial surface representation","radial curve","elastic shape analysis","Riemannian framework","elastic Riemannian metric","facial deformation measurement","facial expression","FRGCv2 database","GavabDB database","Bosphorus database","statistical inference","PCA","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D face recognition","shape analysis","biometrics","quality control","data restoration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Biometric Identification","Databases, Factual","Elasticity","Eyeglasses","Face","Facial Expression","Female","Hair","Hand","Humans","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Male","Posture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition under Expressions, Occlusions, and Pose Variations","volume":"35","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6468044/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13639696","pubMedId":"23868784","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition under Expressions, Occlusions, and Pose Variations","sourcePdf":"ttp2013092270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119374S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6560338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"6560338","articleId":"6468044","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6468048,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-8146-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468048","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","AC motors","Rotors","Variable speed drives","Synchronous motors","Protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ac motor protection","adjustable-speed drive motor protection","IEEE C37.96","induction motor protection","microprocessor-based motor protection","motor","motor bus transfer","rotating machinery protection","synchronous motor protection","wound rotor motor protection"]}],"abstract":"Generally accepted methods of protection for ac motors are provided.

We show that the received signals define a fourth-order tensor satisfying two nested PARAFAC models, and a semi-blind receiver is then derived using a two-step alternating least squares algorithm for joint channel and symbol estimation.

The ability to measure and process these signals may help HCI users to overcome many of the physical limitations and inconveniences in daily life. However, there are currently no effective multidirectional classification methods for monitoring eye movements. Here, we describe a classification method used in a wireless EOG-based HCI device for detecting eye movements in eight directions. This device includes wireless EOG signal acquisition components, wet electrodes and an EOG signal classification algorithm. The EOG classification algorithm is based on extracting features from the electrical signals corresponding to eight directions of eye movement (up, down, left, right, up-left, down-left, up-right, and down-right) and blinking. The recognition and processing of these eight different features were achieved in real-life conditions, demonstrating that this device can reliably measure the features of EOG signals. This system and its classification procedure provide an effective method for identifying eye movements. Additionally, it may be applied to study eye functions in real-life conditions in the near future.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2248154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6558849/06468076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2248154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6558849","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling a Human\u2013Computer Interface System With a Novel Classification Method that Uses Electrooculography Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Controlling a Human\u2013Computer Interface System With a Novel Classification Method that Uses Electrooculography Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13655163","pubMedId":"23446030","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468076/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling a Human\u2013Computer Interface System With a Novel Classification Method that Uses Electrooculography Signals","sourcePdf":"tbme-lin-2248154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09271S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6558849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6558849","articleId":"6468076","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468079,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Yuan Kao","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Penghu University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/6681913/6468079/6468079-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuo-Yuan Kao received the B.S. degree in information engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1989 and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA, in 1997.","He is one the early pioneers of Computer Go.

It uses Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the values of nodes in a search tree. The node values are then used to select the actions during subsequent simulations. The performance of MCTS heavily depends on the quality of its default policy, which guides the simulations beyond the search tree. In this paper, we propose an MCTS improvement, called incentive learning, which learns the default policy online. This new default policy learning scheme is based on ideas from combinatorial game theory, and hence is particularly useful when the underlying game is a sum of games. To illustrate the efficiency of incentive learning, we describe a game named Heap-Go and present experimental results on the game.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2248086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel7/4804728/6681913/06468079.pdf","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive Learning in Monte Carlo Tree Search","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2248086","startPage":"346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Incentive Learning in Monte Carlo Tree Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468079/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13969825","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468079/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive Learning in Monte Carlo Tree Search","sourcePdf":"tciaig-wu-2248086-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11222S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"6681913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6681913","articleId":"6468079","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6468083,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hsiao Peng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6572865/6468083/6468083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Hsiao Peng received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1997, 1999, and 2005, respectively.","From 2000 to 2001, he was with the Intel Microprocessor Research Laboratory, Santa Clara, CA, USA, where he developed the first real-time MPEG-4 fine granularity scalability codec and demonstrated its application in 3-D, peer-to-peer video conferencing.

It has a salient feature of not having to signal the template MV, while achieving a prediction performance close to that of bi-prediction. We begin by studying template matching prediction (TMP) from a theoretical perspective. Based on two signal models, the template MV is shown to approximate the pixel true motion around the template centroid, through which we explain why TMP generally outperforms SKIP prediction but is inferior to block-based motion compensation in terms of prediction performance. We then approach the problem of finding another MV to best complement the template MV from both deterministic and statistical viewpoints, the latter leading to the search of its optimal sampling location in the motion field. The result is a search criterion with OBMC window functions forming a geometry-like motion partitioning when the template area is straddled on the top and to the left of a target block. Generalizations to adaptive template design, multihypothesis prediction and motion merging are made to explore the complexity and performance trade-offs. Extensive experiments based on the HM-6.0 software show that the best of them, in terms of compression performance, achieves 1.7-2.0% BD-rate reductions at a cost of 26% and 39% increases in encoding and decoding times, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2248214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6572865/06468083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2248214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572865","startPage":"1432","endPage":"1446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interframe Prediction Technique Combining Template Matching Prediction and Block-Motion Compensation for High-Efficiency Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Interframe Prediction Technique Combining Template Matching Prediction and Block-Motion Compensation for High-Efficiency Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13685955","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interframe Prediction Technique Combining Template Matching Prediction and Block-Motion Compensation for High-Efficiency Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-peng-2248214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116115S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6572865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6572865","articleId":"6468083","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468087,"authors":[{"name":"Su Nguyen","affiliation":["Victoria University of Wellington, Evolutionary Computation Research Group, Wellington, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6779627/6468087/6468087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Su Nguyen received the B.E. degree in industrial and systems engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2006, and the M.E. degree in industrial engineering and management from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Bangkok, Thailand.

However, the design of an effective scheduling policy is complicated and time consuming due to the complexity of each scheduling decision, as well as the interactions among these decisions. This paper develops four new multi-objective genetic programming-based hyperheuristic (MO-GPHH) methods for automatic design of scheduling policies, including dispatching rules and due-date assignment rules in job shop environments. In addition to using three existing search strategies, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2, and harmonic distance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to develop new MO-GPHH methods, a new approach called diversified multi-objective cooperative evolution (DMOCC) is also proposed. The novelty of these MO-GPHH methods is that they are able to handle multiple scheduling decisions simultaneously. The experimental results show that the evolved Pareto fronts represent effective scheduling policies that can dominate scheduling policies from combinations of existing dispatching rules with dynamic/regression-based due-date assignment rules. The evolved scheduling policies also show dominating performance on unseen simulation scenarios with different shop settings. In addition, the uniformity of the scheduling policies obtained from the proposed method of DMOCC is better than those evolved by other evolutionary approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2248159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2248159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6779627/06468087.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Design of Scheduling Policies for Dynamic Multi-objective Job Shop Scheduling via Cooperative Coevolution Genetic Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Design of Scheduling Policies for Dynamic Multi-objective Job Shop Scheduling via Cooperative Coevolution Genetic Programming","volume":"18","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14196622","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468087/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Design of Scheduling Policies for Dynamic Multi-objective Job Shop Scheduling via Cooperative Coevolution Genetic Programming","sourcePdf":"tevc-nguyen-2248159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128889S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6779627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6779627","articleId":"6468087","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468109,"authors":[{"name":"Zekeriya Uykan","affiliation":["Engineering Faculty, Control and Automation Engineering Department, Dogus University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Zekeriya","lastName":"Uykan","id":"37443661700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6468109","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Convergence","Standards","Lyapunov methods","Channel allocation","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Associative memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","computational complexity","Hopfield neural nets","nonlinear functions","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear function","convergence speed","time-varying link gains","NP-complete","channel allocation optimization problem","cellular radio systems","HNN","fast-convergent double-sigmoid Hopfield neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associative memory","channel allocation problem in cellular radio systems","continuous-time Hopfield neural network","convergence speed","Lyapunov function","optimization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Logic","Memory Disorders","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons","Nonlinear Dynamics"]}],"abstract":"The Hopfield neural network (HNN) has been widely used in numerous different optimization problems since the early 1980s.

In this strategy, on one hand, the 125 space vectors are combined by 96 triangles in the seven-segment vector synthesis method, then the triangles are divided into seven categories which have different characteristics of balancing the NP voltage, and every category has its own principles to choose the vector sequence and compute the vector durations. On the other hand, the dead-time effects of the 5L-ANPC converter are studied in detail and the transitions between different switching states are constrained in the optimized control strategy to avoid the dead-time effects that cannot be compensated by traditional pulse-based dead-time compensation methods. Finally, the optimized SVPWM strategy is experimentally verified in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2248172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2248172","startPage":"386","endPage":"395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6563118/06468110.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized SVPWM Strategy for Five-Level Active NPC (5L-ANPC) Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized SVPWM Strategy for Five-Level Active NPC (5L-ANPC) Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468110/","accessionNumber":"13678447","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468110/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized SVPWM Strategy for Five-Level Active NPC (5L-ANPC) Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-deng-2248172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088262S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6563118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6563118","articleId":"6468110","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Canadian-Crown","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6468116,"authors":[{"name":"Taehui Na","affiliation":["Yonsei University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Taehui","lastName":"Na","id":"37072572600"},{"name":"Seung-Han Woo","affiliation":["Yonsei University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Han","lastName":"Woo","id":"38277621000"},{"name":"Jisu Kim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jisu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600795900"},{"name":"Hanwool Jeong","affiliation":["Yonsei University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hanwool","lastName":"Jeong","id":"38475670800"},{"name":"Seong-Ook Jung","affiliation":["Yonsei University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Ook","lastName":"Jung","id":"37983982700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6468116","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2862},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Transistors","MOS devices","Delay","Power demand","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","semiconductor storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["latch type sense amplifiers","offset voltage","input voltage region","dead zone sensing","memory device","sensing delay","power consumption","PDP","predictive technology model","size 65 nm","voltage 1.1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Latch-type","mismatch","offset voltage","sense amplifier (SA)","sensing dead zone"]}],"abstract":"When the input voltage difference of a sense amplifier (SA) exceeds the offset voltage (VOS), the SA correctly detects it and outputs a large signal. However, when the input voltage is in a certain region, the SA can fail to sense the input voltage difference even if it is sufficiently large. This input voltage region is defined as the sensing dead zone of the SA. Because sensing dead zones differ depending on SAs and the input voltages to the SA differ depending on the memory devices, analyzing the sensing dead zone is very important. In this brief, we analyze the sensing dead zones of the most popular latch-type SAs: voltage- and current-latched SAs. Furthermore, a suitable latch-type SA scheme is suggested for various SA input voltages in terms of sensing delay, power consumption, and PDP, using a 65-nm predictive technology model at a VDD of 1.1 V.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2239320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2239320","startPage":"425","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6716075/06468116.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Study of Various Latch-Type Sense Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Study of Various Latch-Type Sense Amplifiers","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056655","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6468116/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Study of Various Latch-Type Sense Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jung-2239320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179677S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6716075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6716075","articleId":"6468116","onlineDate":"21 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6468119,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085779807"},{"name":"Bo Du","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Du","id":"37392445700"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1939-1404"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1535"}],"articleNumber":"6468119","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Vectors","Optimization","Linear programming","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["endmember dissimilarity constrained nonnegative matrix factorization method","hyperspectral unmixing","NMF","nonconvex problem","endmember dissimilarity constraint","EDC","smooth spectra","dataset space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery","linear mixture model","non-negative matrix factorization","spectral unmixing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468119","abstract":"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been introduced into the field of hyperspectral unmixing in the last ten years.

The proposed constraint can measure the difference between the signatures as well as constrain the signatures to be smooth. A set of smooth spectra contained in the dataset space with the largest differences can be obtained, as far as is possible, which can be seen as endmembers.

Early progress was focused on the numerical design of two dimensional (2-d) transfer functions and the challenging stability issues associated with low-complexity infinite impulse response (iir) implementations. However, over the last decade or so, important practical advances have occurred in the design of 3-d and 4-d iir filters, leading to some important emerging applications. in this tutorial article, some of these applications are described, with emphasis on 2-d spatio-temporal beamforming and 4-d light field processing. in particular, advances in spatio-temporal beamforming for cognitive radio systems and for synthetic aperture radio telescopes are considered. in the 4-d case, we describe a class of 4-d light field filters for image processing, 4-d hyper-fan filters for low-light imaging, depth filtering, denoising and the attenuation of distracting objects, with applications in computational photography and habitat monitoring. Both analog and digital systolic VLsi circuit implementations are described with emphasis on recent progress using field programmable gate array (fPgA)-based and digital VLsi circuits that can potentially operate at radio frequencies in the multi-gHz range. these new innovations open up exciting possibilities for real-time md filters having frames rates in the multi-gHz for emerging radio frequency (rf) antenna signal processing and imaging systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13325844","htmlLink":"/document/6468142/","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional (MD) Circuits and Systems for Emerging Applications Including Cognitive Radio, Radio Astronomy, Robot Vision and Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional (MD) Circuits and Systems for Emerging Applications Including Cognitive Radio, Radio Astronomy, Robot Vision and Imaging","sourcePdf":"13mcas01-madanayake-2237141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267772S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"6468120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6468120","articleId":"6468142","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6468167,"authors":[{"name":"Fred Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6468162/6468167/6468167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fred Chen (S'05) received the B.S. degree from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1997, the M.S. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","From 2000 to 2005 he was with Rambus Inc., Los Altos, CA, where he worked on the design of high-speed I/O and equalization circuits.

We examine the trade-off between the required transmission energy (compression performance) and desired recovered signal quality in the presence of practical non-idealities such as quantization noise, input signal noise and channel errors. The end-to-end system evaluation framework was designed to analyze CS performance under practical sensor settings. The evaluation shows that CS compression can enable over 10X in transmission energy savings while preserving the recovered signal quality to roughly 8 bits of precision. We further present low complexity error control schemes tailored to CS that further reduce the energy costs by 4X as well as diversity scheme to protect against burst errors. Results on a real electrocardiography (EKG) signal demonstrate 10X in energy reduction and corroborate the system analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","volume":"60","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13325876","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468167/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Design of Compressed Sensing Systems for Wireless Sensors Under Performance and Reliability Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Design of Compressed Sensing Systems for Wireless Sensors Under Performance and Reliability Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2215738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194819S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6468162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6468162","articleId":"6468167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6468217,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Liu-ai","affiliation":["School of Mathematics Physics and Software Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Liu-ai","id":"38554696400"},{"name":"Fan Wen-Qing","affiliation":["School of Traffic and Transportation, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wen-Qing","id":"38552430700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2601-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4809-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468217","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468217","abstract":"It is difficult to determine optimal combination parameter which can make the solving performance of ant colony algorithm work better, owing to the bulkiness of parameter space and relevance among parameters.

Finally, an experimental case is analyzed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and the empirical results show that the method can effectively help the client to find the optimal services.","doi":"10.1109/ICEBE.2012.54","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on e-Business Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on e-Business Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6467962/6468209/06468253.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2012.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468209","startPage":"292","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS Evaluation Model for Test-Bed in the Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A QoS Evaluation Model for Test-Bed in the Cloud Computing Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468253/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372274","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468253/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS Evaluation Model for Test-Bed in the Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4809a292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059464S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6467962","isNumber":"6468209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6467962","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6468209","articleId":"6468253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6468296,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Feng Lai","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National ILan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Feng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37289520200"},{"name":"Ying-Xun Lai","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Xun","lastName":"Lai","id":"38238324000"},{"name":"Laurence Tianruo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Saint Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Laurence Tianruo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441600"},{"name":"Han-Chieh Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National ILan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Han-Chieh","lastName":"Chao","id":"37273526700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5146-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4865-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468296","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":687},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home appliances","Energy management","Protocols","Humans","Internet","Random variables","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","domestic appliances","electrical products","energy conservation","energy management systems","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT energy management system service layer","appliance recognition","activity recognition","Internet of Things","energy saving","intelligent system development","household appliance recognition","communication services","human activity","context data","Naive Bayes","electric appliances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Energy Management","Appliance Recognition","Activity Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468296","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) extends and expands the range of the internet by interconnecting Internet and end device networks.

In most cases these networks were proprietary and stand-alone. More recently, many efforts have been undertaken to connect these networks to the Internet using standard protocols. Current solutions that integrate smart resource-constrained objects into the Internet are mostly gateway-based. In these solutions, security, firewalling, protocol translations and intelligence are implemented by gateways at the border of the Internet and the resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach to facilitate the realization of what is called the Internet of Things. Our approach focuses on the objects, both resource-constrained and non-constrained, that need to cooperate by integrating them into a secured virtual network, named an Internet of Things Virtual Network or IoTVN. Inside this IoT-VN full end-to-end communication can take place through the use of protocols that take the limitations of the most resource-constrained devices into account. We describe how this concept maps to several generic use cases and, as such, can constitute a valid alternative approach for supporting selected applications. A first implementation demonstrating the key concepts of this approach is described. It illustrates the feasibility of integrating resource-constrained devices into virtual networks, but also reveals open challenges.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet of Things Virtual Networks: Bringing Network Virtualization to Resource-Constrained Devices","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2012.152","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6467822/6468287/06468329.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2012.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Internet of Things Virtual Networks: Bringing Network Virtualization to Resource-Constrained Devices","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468329/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372148","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internet of Things Virtual Networks: Bringing Network Virtualization to Resource-Constrained Devices","confLoc":"Besancon, France","sourcePdf":"4865a293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054561S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6467822","isNumber":"6468287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6467822","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6468287","articleId":"6468329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6468342,"authors":[{"name":"Javier J.M.

Wildlife sounds usually provide enough data to classify and monitor the fauna. In this context, anurans (frogs and toads) have been used by biologists as early indicators of ecological stress in a given environment. Compressive sensing is a promising technique that can be used to reduce the amount of transmitted data in a wireless sensor network, and, thus, minimize the limited resources of sensors nodes. In this work, we collect samples of the anuran audio using compressive sensing, send them towards the sink node, where the samples are reconstructed and identify the correct anuran specie of each call. Our main goal is to evaluate whether compressive sensing is a viable technique to reconstruct properly the anuran calls and identify the correct specie in an environment monitored by a wireless sensor network. We evaluate the proposed methodology by calculating different sound distances between the original and the reconstructed calls. Results show that sampling only 10% of the original data, the sink node can reconstruct the original audio with a high quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Compressive Sensing for the Reconstruction of Anuran Sounds in a Wireless Sensor Network","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2012.64","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6467822/6468287/06468342.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2012.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Compressive Sensing for the Reconstruction of Anuran Sounds in a Wireless Sensor Network","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468342/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Compressive Sensing for the Reconstruction of Anuran Sounds in a Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Besancon, France","sourcePdf":"4865a394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08075S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6467822","isNumber":"6468287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6467822","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6468287","articleId":"6468342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6468354,"authors":[{"name":"Kensaku Kawauchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensaku","lastName":"Kawauchi","id":"37666203000"},{"name":"Jun Rekimoto","affiliation":["Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Rekimoto","id":"37267458200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5146-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4865-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468354","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Databases","Robot sensing systems","Estimation","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","data acquisition","Global Positioning System","indoor radio","mobile computing","mobile robots","signal sampling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling platform","autonomous robot","mobile device","sensor data collection","indoor environment","calibration","FineMesh method","signal collection","Wi-Fi indoor positioning system","size 10 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor Environments","Walking Robot","Location Positioning","Wi-Fi","Digital Compass"]}],"abstract":"Mobile devices have become wide spread, as a result of improvements in hardware and communication technologies. These devices are equipped with some sensors to protect themselves. In recently years, technologies have been developed that allow a device to recognize its environments using sensor data are developed. However, in an indoor environment, there are objects that affect sensor data. Therefore, sensors required either calibration to adjust their behavior, or clarification of the cause of incorrect behavior. This requires large amounts of sensor data to be collected indoors, but it is difficult for humans to collect this data in the indoor environment. Methods of data collection by humans are limited by the number of observation points that can reasonably be attained. In this paper, we proposed the Fine Mesh method for dense sampling using an autonomous robot. Our proposed method aims to increase the number of observation points. We constructed an autonomous robot that collects signals at 10 cm intervals using positioning estimates with camera images. To confirm the effect of collecting signals in more detail, we evaluate the accuracy of a Wi-Fi indoor positioning system constructed by our robot. We then use our platform to evaluate the efficacy of detailed signal collection.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2012.56","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6467822/6468287/06468354.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"486","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2012.56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FineMesh: High-Density Sampling Platform Using an Autonomous Robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"FineMesh: High-Density Sampling Platform Using an Autonomous Robot","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6468354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372172","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FineMesh: High-Density Sampling Platform Using an Autonomous Robot","confLoc":"Besancon, France","sourcePdf":"4865a477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055677S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6467822","isNumber":"6468287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6467822","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6468287","articleId":"6468354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6468374,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Xu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Xu","id":"38552457600"},{"name":"Roberto Rojas-Cessa","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Rojas-Cessa","id":"38554705100"},{"name":"Haim Grebel","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Haim","lastName":"Grebel","id":"37265962900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5146-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4865-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468374","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":272},"abstract":"Electrical power supply of data centers constitutes major operational costs. In this paper, we focus on providing the supplying energy to exact match the consumption demands by using the properties of a digital power grid. Different from the present power grid, where energy is supplied continuously and in amounts to satisfy large demands, the digital power grid supplies energy in the form of packets and upon request. Energy packets are specifically addressed to one, or multiple servers and to no others, and they carry the amount of energy that has been requested. To evaluate the level of energy supply, we model the consumption time of a server as an ON-OFF Markov chain.

Industrial control system networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of. In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network.

Focusing on individual code regions, our compiler uses a novel search technique to compute a set of optimal solutions, which are encoded into a multi-versioned executable.

We demonstrate our method by tuning loop tiling in cache-sensitive parallel programs, optimizing for both runtime and efficiency. Our static optimizer finds solutions matching or surpassing those determined by exhaustively sampling the search space on a regular grid, while using less than 4% of the computational effort on average. Additionally, we show that parallelism-aware multi-versioning approaches like our own gain a performance improvement of up to 70% over solutions tuned for only one specific number of threads.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.7","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468452.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective auto-tuning framework for parallel codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective auto-tuning framework for parallel codes","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372305","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468452/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective auto-tuning framework for parallel codes","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108027S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468463,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Malawski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland","Center for Research Computing, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Malawski","id":"37421618700"},{"name":"Gideon Juve","affiliation":["USC Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gideon","lastName":"Juve","id":"38550359000"},{"name":"Ewa Deelman","affiliation":["USC Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ewa","lastName":"Deelman","id":"37276642300"},{"name":"Jarek Nabrzyski","affiliation":["Center for Research Computing, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Jarek","lastName":"Nabrzyski","id":"37443466900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0806-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0805-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"CD","value":"2167-4329"}],"articleNumber":"6468463","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Runtime","Schedules","Dynamic scheduling","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","scheduling","task analysis","uncertainty handling","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workflow structure","admission procedure","task runtime estimation","uncertainty handling","resource provisioning","task scheduling","static strategy","dynamic strategy","assess algorithm","infrastructure as a service","IaaS cloud","scientific workflow ensemble"]}],"abstract":"Large-scale applications expressed as scientific workflows are often grouped into ensembles of inter-related workflows. In this paper, we address a new and important problem concerning the efficient management of such ensembles under budget and deadline constraints on Infrastructure- as-aService (IaaS) clouds. We discuss, develop, and assess algorithms based on static and dynamic strategies for both task scheduling and resource provisioning. We perform the evaluation via simulation using a set of scientific workflow ensembles with a broad range of budget and deadline parameters, taking into account uncertainties in task runtime estimations, provisioning delays, and failures. We find that the key factor determining the performance of an algorithm is its ability to decide which workflows in an ensemble to admit or reject for execution.

This provides load balance and maximizes parallelism. However, existing automatic tiling frameworks often choose hyperplanes that lead to pipelined start-up and load imbalance. We address this issue with a new tiling technique that ensures concurrent start-up as well as perfect load-balance whenever possible. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions on tiling hyperplanes to enable concurrent start for programs with affine data accesses. We then provide an approach to find such hyperplanes. Experimental evaluation on a 12-core Intel Westmere shows that our code is able to outperform a tuned domain-specific stencil code generator by 4% to 27%, and previous compiler techniques by a factor of 2\u00d7 to 10.14\u00d7.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.107","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468470.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tiling stencil computations to maximize parallelism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468470/","displayDocTitle":"Tiling stencil computations to maximize parallelism","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372322","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468470/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tiling stencil computations to maximize parallelism","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103744S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468471,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38548808000"},{"name":"Pietro Cicotti","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Cicotti","id":"37281804400"},{"name":"Eric Bylaska","affiliation":["Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Bylaska","id":"38054709700"},{"name":"Dan Quinlan","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Quinlan","id":"37326536200"},{"name":"Scott B.

We achieved our results with only modest amounts of programmer annotation and no intrusive reprogramming of the original application source.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6468471/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372323","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bamboo -- Translating MPI applications to a latency-tolerant, data-driven form","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bamboo -- Translating MPI applications to a latency-tolerant, data-driven form","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09637S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6468480,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37598555300"},{"name":"Doe Hyun Yoon","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Doe Hyun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38243849300"},{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA","University of Notre Dame, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238884300"},{"name":"Jishen Zhao","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA","Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jishen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537641000"},{"name":"Jung Ho Ahn","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673865600"},{"name":"Jay B.

Providing strong error tolerance in memory usually requires a wide memory channel that incurs a large access granularity (hence, a large cache line). Unfortunately, applications with limited spatial locality waste memory power and bandwidth on systems with a large access granularity. Thus, careful design considerations must be made to balance memory system performance, power efficiency, and resiliency. In this paper, we propose MAGE, a Memory system with Adaptive Granularity and ECC, to achieve high performance, power efficiency, and resiliency. MAGE can adapt memory access granularities and ECC schemes to applications with different memory behaviors. Our experiments show that MAGE achieves more than a 28% energy-delay product improvement, compared to the best existing systems with static granularity and ECC.","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468480.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAGE: Adaptive Granularity and ECC for resilient and power efficient memory systems","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.73","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MAGE: Adaptive Granularity and ECC for resilient and power efficient memory systems","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372331","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6468480/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAGE: Adaptive Granularity and ECC for resilient and power efficient memory systems","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129787S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468481,"authors":[{"name":"Donghong Wu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Donghong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37067095600"},{"name":"Bingsheng He","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bingsheng","lastName":"He","id":"37532755800"},{"name":"Xueyan Tang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xueyan","lastName":"Tang","id":"38550413500"},{"name":"Jianliang Xu","affiliation":["Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianliang","lastName":"Xu","id":"38553175500"},{"name":"Minyi Guo","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Minyi","lastName":"Guo","id":"38551714900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0806-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0805-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"CD","value":"2167-4329"}],"articleNumber":"6468481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Energy consumption","Histograms","Memory management","Predictive models","Optimization","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","optimisation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAMZzz","rank aware DRAM power management","dynamic migrations","dynamic demotions","energy consumer","server machines","rank aware energy saving optimizations","memory controller","dynamic page migrations","data access patterns","power state transitions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468481","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468481.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.99","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAMZzz: Rank-aware DRAM power management with dynamic migrations and demotions","abstract":"Main memory is a significant energy consumer which may contribute to over 40% of the total system power, and will become more significant for server machines with more main memory.

Recent publications have confirmed that DRAM errors are a common source of failures in the field. Therefore, further attention to the faults experienced by DRAM sub-systems is warranted. In this paper, we present a study of 11 months of DRAM errors in a large high-performance computing cluster. Our goal is to understand the failure modes, rates, and fault types experienced by DRAM in production settings. We identify several unique DRAM failure modes, including single-bit, multi-bit, and multi-chip failures. We also provide a deterministic bound on the rate of transient faults in the DRAM array, by exploiting the presence of a hardware scrubber on our nodes. We draw several conclusions from our study. First, DRAM failures are dominated by permanent, rather than transient, faults, although not to the extent found by previous publications. Second, DRAMs are susceptible to large multi-bit failures, such as failures that affect an entire DRAM row or column, indicating faults in shared internal circuitry. Third, we identify a DRAM failure mode that disrupts access to other DRAM devices that share the same board-level circuitry. Finally, we find that chipkill error-correcting codes (ECC) are extremely effective, reducing the node failure rate from uncorrected DRAM errors by 42x compared to single-error correct/double-error detect (SEC-DED) ECC.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.13","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468486.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of DRAM failures in the field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468486/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A study of DRAM failures in the field","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13372336","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6468486/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of DRAM failures in the field","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090493S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6468487,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Gainaru","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Gainaru","id":"37546431600"},{"name":"Franck Cappello","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Cappello","id":"37299773700"},{"name":"Marc Snir","affiliation":["MCS, ANL, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Snir","id":"37295848200"},{"name":"William Kramer","affiliation":["NCSA, UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37340172500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0806-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0805-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"CD","value":"2167-4329"}],"articleNumber":"6468487","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Itemsets","Signal analysis","Data mining","Checkpointing","Algorithm design and analysis","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fault tolerant computing","microscopes","parallel processing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","component failure dynamics","event log signal analyzer toolkit","ELSA toolkit","data mining techniques","checkpoint-restart strategy","fault tolerance strategies","high-performance computing systems","HPC systems","microscope","fault prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault tolerance","large-scale HPC systems","signal analysis","fault detection"]}],"abstract":"A large percentage of computing capacity in today's large high-performance computing systems is wasted because of failures. Consequently current research is focusing on providing fault tolerance strategies that aim to minimize fault's effects on applications. By far the most popular technique is the checkpointrestart strategy. A complement to this classical approach is failure avoidance, by which the occurrence of a fault is predicted and preventive measures are taken. This requires a reliable prediction system to anticipate failures and their locations. Thus far, research in this field has used ideal predictors that were not implemented in real HPC systems. In this paper, we merge signal analysis concepts with data mining techniques to extend the ELSA (Event Log Signal Analyzer) toolkit and offer an adaptive and more efficient prediction module. Our goal is to provide models that characterize the normal behavior of a system and the way faults affect it. Being able to detect deviations from normality quickly is the foundation of accurate fault prediction. However, this is challenging because component failure dynamics are heterogeneous in space and time. To this end, a large part of the paper is focused on a detailed analysis of the prediction method, by applying it to two large-scale systems and by investigating the characteristics and bottlenecks of each step of the prediction process. Furthermore, we analyze the prediction's precision and recall impact on current checkpointing strategies and highlight future improvements and directions for research in this field.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.57","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468487.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault prediction under the microscope: A closer look into HPC systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault prediction under the microscope: A closer look into HPC systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468487/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372337","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468487/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault prediction under the microscope: A closer look into HPC systems","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085109S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6468489,"authors":[{"name":"Linchuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Linchuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38550864800"},{"name":"Xin Huo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Huo","id":"37847138500"},{"name":"Gagan Agrawal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Gagan","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37276602400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0806-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0805-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"CD","value":"2167-4329"}],"articleNumber":"6468489","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":451},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Computer architecture","Message systems","Load management","Pipeline processing","Indexes","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","graphics processing units","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MapReduce","coupled CPU-GPU architecture","scalable high performance computing","parallel application","data mining","machine learning","map-dividing scheme","pipelining scheme","dynamic work distribution scheme","runtime tuning method","continuous reduction method","intranode acceleration"]}],"abstract":"The work presented here is driven by two observations. First, heterogeneous architectures that integrate a CPU and a GPU on the same chip are emerging, and hold much promise for supporting power-efficient and scalable high performance computing. Second, MapReduce has emerged as a suitable framework for simplified parallel application development for many classes of applications, including data mining and machine learning applications that benefit from accelerators. This paper focuses on the challenge of scaling a MapReduce application using the CPU and GPU together in an integrated architecture. We develop different methods for dividing the work, which are the map-dividing scheme, where map tasks are divided between both devices, and the pipelining scheme, which pipelines the map and the reduce stages on different devices. We develop dynamic work distribution schemes for both the approaches. To achieve high load balance while keeping scheduling costs low, we use a runtime tuning method to adjust task block sizes for the map-dividing scheme. Our implementation of MapReduce is based on a continuous reduction method, which avoids the memory overheads of storing key-value pairs. We have evaluated the different design decisions using 5 popular MapReduce applications. For 4 of the applications, our system achieves 1.21 to 2.1 speedup over the better of the CPU-only and GPU-only versions. The speedups over a single CPU core execution range from 3.25 to 28.68. The runtime tuning method we have developed achieves very low load imbalance, while keeping scheduling overheads low. Though our current work is specific to MapReduce, many underlying ideas are also applicable towards intra-node acceleration of other applications on integrated CPU-GPU nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating MapReduce on a coupled CPU-GPU architecture","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.16","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468489.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating MapReduce on a coupled CPU-GPU architecture","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468489/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372339","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating MapReduce on a coupled CPU-GPU architecture","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079604S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6468490,"authors":[{"name":"Seyong Lee","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Seyong","lastName":"Lee","id":"38552184200"},{"name":"Jeffrey S.

However, their programming complexity remains as a major hurdle for their widespread adoption. To provide better abstractions for programming GPU architectures, researchers and vendors have proposed several directive-based GPU programming models. These directive-based models provide different levels of abstraction, and required different levels of programming effort to port and optimize applications. Understanding these differences among these new models provides valuable insights on their applicability and performance potential. In this paper, we evaluate existing directive-based models by porting thirteen application kernels from various scientific domains to use CUDA GPUs, which, in turn, allows us to identify important issues in the functionality, scalability, tunability, and debuggability of the existing models. Our evaluation shows that directive-based models can achieve reasonable performance, compared to hand-written GPU codes.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.51","publicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468170/6468439/06468490.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2012.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early evaluation of directive-based GPU programming models for productive exascale computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468490/","displayDocTitle":"Early evaluation of directive-based GPU programming models for productive exascale computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13382730","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468490/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early evaluation of directive-based GPU programming models for productive exascale computing","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074055S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6468497,"authors":[{"name":"N.

For dataintensive applications, network performance becomes key component as the amount of data being stored and replicated to HDFS increases. In this paper, we present a novel design of HDFS using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over InfiniBand via JNI interfaces. Experimental results show that, for 5GB HDFS file writes, the new design reduces the communication time by 87% and 30% over 1Gigabit Ethernet (1GigE) and IP-over-InfiniBand (IPoIB), respectively, on QDR platform (32Gbps). For HBase, the Put operation performance is improved by 26% with our design.

First, our solver is the first numerically stable tridiagonal solver for GPUs. Our solver provides comparable quality of stable solutions to Intel MKL and Matlab, at speed comparable to the GPU tridiagonal solvers in existing packages like CUSPARSE. It is also scalable to multiple GPUs and CPUs.

One potential solution is to change the data analysis pipeline from a post-process centric to a concurrent approach based on either in-situ or in-transit processing. In this context computations are considered in-situ if they utilize the primary compute resources, while in-transit processing refers to offloading computations to a set of secondary resources using asynchronous data transfers. In this paper we explore the design and implementation of three common analysis techniques typically performed on large-scale scientific simulations: topological analysis, descriptive statistics, and visualization. We summarize algorithmic developments, describe a resource scheduling system to coordinate the execution of various analysis workflows, and discuss our implementation using the DataSpaces and ADIOS frameworks that support efficient data movement between in-situ and in-transit computations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our lightweight, flexible framework by deploying it on the Jaguar XK6 to analyze data generated by S3D, a massively parallel turbulent combustion code. Our framework allows scientists dealing with the data deluge at extreme scale to perform analyses at increased temporal resolutions, mitigate I/O costs, and significantly improve the time to insight.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and

describes and evaluates a scalable and efficient resilience scheme based on the concept of containment domains. Containment domains are a programming construct that enable applications to express resilience needs and to interact with the system to tune and specialize error detection, state preservation and restoration, and recovery schemes. Containment domains have weak transactional semantics and are nested to take advantage of the machine and application hierarchies and to enable hierarchical state preservation, restoration, and recovery. We evaluate the scalability and efficiency of containment domains using generalized trace-driven simulation and analytical analysis and show that containment domains are superior to both checkpoint restart and redundant execution approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13372377","htmlLink":"/document/6468537/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Containment domains: A scalable, efficient, and flexible resilience scheme for exascale systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment domains: A scalable, efficient, and flexible resilience scheme for exascale systems","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"1000a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102688S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6468170","isNumber":"6468439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468170","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6468439","articleId":"6468537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6468542,"authors":[{"name":"Surendra Byna","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Surendra","lastName":"Byna","id":"37085862825"},{"name":"Jerry Chou","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Chou","id":"37274488400"},{"name":"Oliver Rubel","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Rubel","id":"38549423900"},{"name":"Prabhat","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA"],"lastName":"Prabhat","id":"37589721200"},{"name":"Homa Karimabadi","affiliation":["University of California-San Diego, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Homa","lastName":"Karimabadi","id":"37423676400"},{"name":"William S.

We demonstrate the successful application of H5Part, a particle data extension of parallel HDF5, for writing the dataset at a significant fraction of system peak I/O rates. To enable efficient analysis, we develop hybrid parallel FastQuery to index and query data using multi-core CPUs on distributed memory hardware. We show good scalability results for the FastQuery implementation using up to 10,000 cores.

Firstly, combined with the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the active-segment selection. Multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification.

Experimental results on multiple VCI datasets show that the proposed solution can effectively cure the problem when the datasets are noisy and highly imbalanced.","doi":"10.1109/GrC.2012.6468599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GrC.2012.6468599","startPage":"376","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459622/6468554/06468599.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass SVM with ramp loss for imbalanced data classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass SVM with ramp loss for imbalanced data classification","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468599/","accessionNumber":"13397092","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468599/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass SVM with ramp loss for imbalanced data classification","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"G2085452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065161S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459622","isNumber":"6468554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459622","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6468554","articleId":"6468599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6468680,"authors":[{"name":"Jie-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, 100081, China"],"firstName":"Jie-Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089055316"},{"name":"Ming Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, 100081, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37087490493"},{"name":"Feng-Jiao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, 100081, China"],"firstName":"Feng-Jiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087490059"},{"name":"An-Di Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, 100081, China"],"firstName":"An-Di","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087490309"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2311-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2310-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6468680","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468680","abstract":"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack presents the following characteristics, that the botnets become extra-large scale, the mode of attack presents a variety of characteristics and the application-level attacks become the main attack approach, which seriously impact on Internet Security.

The main drawback of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is not translation invariant. Translations of an image lead to different wavelet coefficients.

The classification of human emotional state is achieved by extracting the energies from all sub-bands of UWT. The robust K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) is constructed for classification.

Although functional devices below 10 nm have been already demonstrated, assessing the ultimate scaling of RRAM requires a detailed understanding and modeling of switching and reliability processes. This work discusses the modeling of bipolar switching in RRAM. An analytical model is first introduced to describe the temperature- and field-accelerated growth of the conductive filament (CF) induced by ion migration. The analytical model accounts for time-resolved data of the set transition, highlighting the central role of voltage as the driving parameter for set/reset transitions. The analytical model also accounts for the switching parameters as a function of the compliance current.

While finding and counting all cycles in a graph is a very hard problem, efficient algorithms have been proposed recently to find all short cycles up to some maximum length. For the message-passing decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, these short cycles are the main cause for the existing performance gap to optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding. In this paper, we exploit this observation in the proposed novel method of realizing rate-compatible (RC) LDPC codes with short block lengths by inserting known dummy bits into the information bit sequence before encoding. This technique can be seen as a special case of traditional code shortening and allows to achieve lower code rates using one fixed rate mother code. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the selection of the specific dummy bit positions in a way that \"breaks\" a significant number of short cycles in the mother code's graph which, thus, no longer degrade the decoding performance.","publicationTitle":"SCC 2013; 9th International ITG Conference on Systems, Communication and Coding","displayPublicationTitle":"SCC 2013; 9th International ITG Conference on Systems, Communication and Coding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468888/6468889/06468978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Breaking Cycles with Dummy Bits: Improved Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes with Short Block Lengths","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breaking Cycles with Dummy Bits: Improved Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes with Short Block Lengths","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"453482027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029076S","chronDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","isNumber":"6468889","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468888","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6468978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6468990,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Leduc-Primeau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468990/6468990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fran\u00e7ois Leduc-Primeau (S'09) received the B.

However, achieving this in a circuit implementation is complicated by the number of wires required to exchange messages between processing nodes. Decoding algorithms that exchange binary messages are interesting for fully-parallel implementations because they can reduce the number and the length of the wires, and increase logic density. This paper introduces the Relaxed Half-Stochastic (RHS) decoding algorithm, a binary message belief propagation (BP) algorithm that achieves a coding gain comparable to the best known BP algorithms that use real-valued messages. We derive the RHS algorithm by starting from the well-known Sum-Product algorithm, and then derive a low-complexity version suitable for circuit implementation. We present extensive simulation results on two standardized codes having different rates and constructions, including low bit error rate results. These simulations show that RHS can converge faster on average than existing state-of-the-art decoding algorithms, leading to improvements in throughput and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468990.pdf","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxed Half-Stochastic Belief Propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed Half-Stochastic Belief Propagation","volume":"61","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530837","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468990/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468990/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed Half-Stochastic Belief Propagation","sourcePdf":"1648-tc1305-leduc.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075707S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468990","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6468991,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Pourahmadi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468991/6468991-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vahid Pourahmadi received the B.

Finally, we show through a few examples that there exist some network configurations where multi-stream data transmission in conjunction with interference alignment is necessary in order to achieve the upper-bound.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468991.pdf","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO-MAC with Random Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468991/","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO-MAC with Random Access","volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530838","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468991/","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of MIMO-MAC with Random Access","sourcePdf":"1956-tc1305-vahid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081996S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468991","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6468993,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Ozdemir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468993/6468993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ozgur Ozdemir received the B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bogazici University, Turkey in 1999 and the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

We derive a new analytical expression for the average subcarrier SINR of the I/Q imbalance-ignorant beamformer in terms of the I/Q imbalance level at both the transmit and receive sides, the size of the beamforming array, and the input SNR level. This expression motivates the need for I/Q imbalance compensation and provides valuable design insights when examining several special and limiting cases. Next, we derive the throughput-maximizing multiple beamforming transmit/receive coefficients under a general system model with an asymmetric frequency-dependent (FD) joint transmit-receive I/Q imbalance. In addition, we propose a low-complexity pilot-aided scheme for the estimation of the channel and I/Q imbalance parameters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed generalized multiple beamforming scheme is highly effective in mitigating I/Q imbalance effects at practical complexity levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I/Q Imbalance in Multiple Beamforming {OFDM} Transceivers: SINR Analysis and Digital Baseband Compensation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120321","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468993.pdf","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"I/Q Imbalance in Multiple Beamforming {OFDM} Transceivers: SINR Analysis and Digital Baseband Compensation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6468993/","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530840","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I/Q Imbalance in Multiple Beamforming {OFDM} Transceivers: SINR Analysis and Digital Baseband Compensation","sourcePdf":"1914-tc1305-ozgur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115295S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468993","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468995,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche 8506, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00c9lectricit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468995/6468995-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Di Renzo (S'05-AM'07-M'09) was born in L'Aquila, Italy, in 1978.

The framework leverages recent application of stochastic geometry and Poisson Point Processes (PPPs) theory to network interference modeling. To assess the impact of spatial dependence across multiple receive-antennas, three models of network interference are studied: i) the isotropic model, where all receive-antennas see interferers belonging to the same PPP; ii) the independent model, where each receive-antenna sees interferers belonging to an independent PPP; and iii) the mixture model, which is a superposition of isotropic and independent interferences. Depending on the fading distribution of the interferers, the Nakagami-m fading parameter of the probe link, and the number of receive-antennas, either exact or upper-bound formulas of the error probability averaged over noise, fading, and spatial interference are given. Our analysis shows that, depending on the interference model, performance can either improve or get worse with multiple antennas at the receiver. The proposed analytical methodology is applicable to single- and multi-PPPs interference environments.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468995.pdf","startPage":"2025","endPage":"2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Performance of Multi-Antenna Receivers in a Poisson Field of Interferers: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468995/","displayDocTitle":"Error Performance of Multi-Antenna Receivers in a Poisson Field of Interferers: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530842","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468995/","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Performance of Multi-Antenna Receivers in a Poisson Field of Interferers: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","sourcePdf":"2025-tc1305-marco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.2041S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468995","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6468996,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmal Fernando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer System Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468996/6468996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nirmal Fernando received the B.Sc (Hones), and PG.

In order to avoid this, we introduce a new technique called smart carrier positioning. We show both analytically and by simulation that the smart carrier positioning can improve the diversity order and the performance of standard self-het OFDM by approximately 4dB at bit error rate of 10^{-2}. In addition, we investigate the optimum power allocation between the carrier and the OFDM subcarriers under frequency selective conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468996.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Heterodyne OFDM Transmission for Frequency Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468996/","displayDocTitle":"Self-Heterodyne OFDM Transmission for Frequency Selective Channels","volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530843","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6468996/","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Heterodyne OFDM Transmission for Frequency Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"1936-tc1305-nirmal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161919S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468996","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468997,"authors":[{"name":"Can Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468997/6468997-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Can Sun received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 2006 and 2012 from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA, now renamed as Beihang University).

We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE), where both the transmit and circuit power consumptions are taken into consideration. To this end, we optimize the active number of subcarriers and the number of bits to each subcarrier at the two source nodes. The optimal solution turns out to be a bidirectional water-filling bit allocation to minimize the overall transmit power, and a subcarrier reduction algorithm to balance the transmit and circuit power consumptions. When the data amounts at the two source nodes are unequal, the bidirectional water-filling leads to a hybrid one- and two-way relaying strategy, which employs one-way relaying on some subcarriers and two-way relaying on some of the other subcarriers. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid one- and two-way relaying with subcarrier reduction, which is optimized towards EE, is more energy efficient than that without subcarrier reduction, which only minimizes the transmit power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468997/","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6468997/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13530844","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient OFDM Relay Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient OFDM Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"1797-tc1305-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071508S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468997","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6468998,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Zennaro","affiliation":["Cisco Systems Italy s.r.l., Milano-Vimercate, Italy","Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468998/6468998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Zennaro (S'07, M'13) was born in Venice on August 26th, 1984.

Assuming exponentially distributed random delays in a two-way message exchange mechanism, this work proposes a network-wide clock synchronization algorithm using a factor graph representation of the network. Message passing using the max-product algorithm is adopted to derive the update rules for the proposed iterative procedure. A closed form solution is obtained for each node's belief about its clock offset at each iteration. Simulation results show that the application of the proposed message passing-based network-wide clock synchronization algorithm provides convergent estimates for both regular cycle-free and random topologies. Moreover, the mean square error (MSE) performance of the proposed algorithm is also compared with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for small example networks, which further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","startPage":"2012","endPage":"2024","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06468998.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Wide Clock Synchronization via Message Passing with Exponentially Distributed Link Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6468998/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network-Wide Clock Synchronization via Message Passing with Exponentially Distributed Link Delays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530845","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Wide Clock Synchronization via Message Passing with Exponentially Distributed Link Delays","sourcePdf":"2012-tc1305-davide.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12608S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468998","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6468999,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Safari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6468999/6468999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid Safari (S'08-M'11) received B.

A framework is presented for analytical and numerical performance analyses of multi-beam FSO systems employed in a diversity or multiplexing scheme. The performance analyses show that the far-field assumptions may not correctly estimate the system behavior in many geometrical scenarios within practical interest. The results demonstrate the degrading effects of diffraction and spatial correlation of atmospheric turbulence in the form of diversity gain reduction in diversity systems and crosstalk in multiplexing systems. These effects have been mostly neglected in the literature by applying far-field assumptions. Our results can thus be useful in the design of practical diversity or multiplexing FSO systems especially when a compact design is desired.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6468999/","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6468999/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13530846","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diversity and Multiplexing for Near-Field Atmospheric Optical Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity and Multiplexing for Near-Field Atmospheric Optical Communication","sourcePdf":"1988-tc1305-majid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051601S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6468999","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469000,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6469000/6469000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuai Wang received his B.Eng degree and Ph.D. degree from Zhengzhou University and Beijing Institute of Technology, P.

We establish the optimal multiuser timing and channel estimates for the uplink MC-DS-CDMA receiver by minimising a weighted least squares cost function with respect to K independent parameters, where K is the number of active users. A guided random search procedure known as Repeated Weighted Boosting Search (RWBS) is invoked for numerically solving this challenging multivariate optimisation problem, and thereby for producing near-optimal timing and channel estimates. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the JTCE problem of interest is derived to benchmark the performance of the proposed RWBS based estimator. Quantitatively, for the scenario of K=10 users, E_b/N_0\u22653 dB where E_b is the energy per bit and N_0 the single-sided noise power spectral density, and for a near-far ratio of 10 dB, the RWBS based estimator using an observation window of 20 symbols is shown to approach the CRLB at a complexity 10 orders of magnitude lower in comparison to its full maximum likelihood search based counterpart. The proposed algorithm does not require the transmission of known pilots, yet it is capable of handling time-variant channel states.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06469000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.120858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Timing and Channel Estimation for Bandlimited Long-Code-Based MC-DS-CDMA: A Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Algorithm and the CRLB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Timing and Channel Estimation for Bandlimited Long-Code-Based MC-DS-CDMA: A Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Algorithm and the CRLB","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530847","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Timing and Channel Estimation for Bandlimited Long-Code-Based MC-DS-CDMA: A Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Algorithm and the CRLB","sourcePdf":"1998-tc1305-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169756S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6469000","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469001,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6521948/6469001/6469001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Zhu received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 1997, and the M.

Recently, Wang and Luo investigated the clipped signal and proposed a modified algorithm called optimized ICF (OICF). This is an optimal algorithm since it can achieve the required PAPR reduction with minimum in-band distortion and far fewer iterations. However, OICF needs to solve a convex optimization problem with O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) complexity, where N represents the number of subcarriers. In this paper, instead of analyzing the clipped signal, we study the clipping noise and propose a simplified OICF algorithm. In the new algorithm, solving the convex optimization problem is approximated by some simple algebraic operations and the computational complexity reduces to O(N). Simulation results show that after three iterations, the original OICF algorithm can achieve the desired PAPR while the simplified one exhibits almost the same performance: for a 128-subcarrier and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated OFDM system, the PAPR-reduction performance difference between the two algorithms are 5\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\ndB at a 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n clipping probability and the bit-error-rate performance difference is 6\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n dB at a 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-7</sup>\n error probability.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.110867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6521948/06469001.pdf","startPage":"1891","endPage":"1901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021913.110867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Approach to Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469001/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Approach to Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13530848","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469001/","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Approach to Optimized Iterative Clipping and Filtering for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"1891-tc1305-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083981S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6521948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6521948","articleId":"6469001","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6469076,"authors":[{"name":"Ian M.

From this data, we extracted overall grasp frequency, duration distributions for each grasp, and common transitions between grasps. The results show that for 80 percent of the study duration the housekeepers used just five grasps and the machinists used 10. The grasping patterns for the different subjects were compared, and the overall top 10 grasps are discussed in detail.

We base our work on two observations. First, most physical phenomena are compressible in some transform domain basis. Second, most WSNs have some form of heterogeneity. Given these two observations, we propose a nonuniform compressive sensing method to improve the performance of WSNs by exploiting both compressibility and heterogeneity. We apply our proposed method to real WSN data sets. We find that our method can provide a more accurate temporal-spatial profile for a given energy budget compared with other sampling methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2248253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2248253","endPage":"2128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6504509/06469154.pdf","startPage":"2120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform Compressive Sensing for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469154/","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform Compressive Sensing for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"13448894","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469154/","publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform Compressive Sensing for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-shen-2248253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074918S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6504509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6504509","articleId":"6469154","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469157,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Behdad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Behdad","id":"37279808100"},{"name":"Meng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Li","id":"37536965400"},{"name":"Yazid Yusuf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Yazid","lastName":"Yusuf","id":"37544049000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6469157","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3463},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Ultra wideband antennas","Resonant frequency","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","loop antennas","microwave antennas","UHF antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional radiation patterns","ultra wideband antenna","monopole-like radiation characteristics","diamond-shaped loops","series capacitor","feeding terminals","microwave antennas","UHF antennas","frequency 1.0 GHz to 4.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband antennas","electrically small antennas","omnidirectional antennas","ultrawideband (UWB) antennas"]}],"abstract":"We present a compact, ultra-low-profile, ultrawideband (UWB) antenna with monopole-like radiation characteristics.

Utilizing this mode, the correlation of a lossy long-term evolution (LTE) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array can be reduced efficiently, even down to zero, by increasing the Q factors of the MIMO antenna elements. In practice, the Q factors can be straight forwardly tuned through different input impedance matching. The zero correlation occurs at a Q factor higher than that resulting from the conjugate input impedance matching. On one hand, if the inter-element distance is larger than a certain distance (what we denominate as the Critical Distance), the total efficiency can also be improved in addition to reducing the correlation. On the other hand, when the inter-element distance is less than the critical distance, a reference MIMO antenna with high correlation and high total efficiency is obtained. This antenna can well be proposed for over-the-air (OTA) measurement applications. The introduced scattering mode is investigated for dual monopoles on a large lossy ground plane and for various mobile terminal MIMO antenna designs. A wideband MIMO antenna, with multiple resonances, covering the band 746-870 MHz is proposed with the envelope correlation coefficient and total efficiency less than 0.5 and higher than 50% (-3 dB), respectively. Measurements and simulations agree well for all the fabricated prototypes. The envelope correlations and the multiplexing efficiencies of the prototypes are also investigated in propagation channels with Gaussian distributed angle of arrivals.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2248071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6521402/06469169.pdf","startPage":"3280","endPage":"3291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2248071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of the Envelope Correlation Coefficient With Improved Total Efficiency for Mobile LTE MIMO Antenna Arrays: Mutual Scattering Mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of the Envelope Correlation Coefficient With Improved Total Efficiency for Mobile LTE MIMO Antenna Arrays: Mutual Scattering Mode","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469169/","accessionNumber":"13529434","volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of the Envelope Correlation Coefficient With Improved Total Efficiency for Mobile LTE MIMO Antenna Arrays: Mutual Scattering Mode","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2248071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08213S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6521402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6521402","articleId":"6469169","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6469170,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-an Chan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-an","lastName":"Chan","id":"37716639100"},{"name":"Lin-shan Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lin-shan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37271904300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"6469170","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech","Speech recognition","Data models","Viterbi algorithm","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood estimation","query processing","speech recognition","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MediaEval 2011 Spoken Web Search corpus","mean average precision improvement","ASM indexing","zero-resource settings","pseudorelevant-irrelevant examples","query-antiquery HMM","pseudorelevance feedback framework","pseudolikelihood ratio approach","speaking rate distortion problem","DC-Vite algorithm","duration-constrained Viterbi algorithm","time trajectory","signal distributions","query frames","document state matching","query matching phase","acoustic segment models","repeated patterns","self-organizing models","dynamic time warping","annotated data","speech recognition","spoken queries","model-based unsupervised spoken term detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic segment model","dynamic time warping","unsupervised spoken term detection","zero-resource"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469170","abstract":"We present a set of model-based approaches for unsupervised spoken term detection (STD) with spoken queries that requires neither speech recognition nor annotated data. This work shows the possibilities in migrating from DTW-based to model-based approaches for unsupervised STD. The proposed approach consists of three components: self-organizing models, query matching, and query modeling. To construct the self-organizing models, repeated patterns are captured and modeled using acoustic segment models (ASMs). In the query matching phase, a document state matching (DSM) approach is proposed to represent documents as ASM sequences, which are matched to the query frames. In this way, not only do the ASMs better model the signal distributions and time trajectories of speech, but the much-smaller number of states than frames for the documents leads to a much lower computational load. A novel duration-constrained Viterbi (DC-Vite) algorithm is further proposed for the above matching process to handle the speaking rate distortion problem. In the query modeling phase, a pseudo likelihood ratio (PLR) approach is proposed in the pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) framework. A likelihood ratio evaluated with query/anti-query HMMs trained with pseudo relevant/irrelevant examples is used to verify the detected spoken term hypotheses. The proposed framework demonstrates the usefulness of ASMs for STD in zero-resource settings and the potential of an instantly responding STD system using ASM indexing. The best performance is achieved by integrating DTW-based approaches into the rescoring steps in the proposed framework. Experimental results show an absolute 14.2% of mean average precision improvement with 77% CPU time reduction compared with the segmental DTW approach on a Mandarin broadcast news corpus. Consistent improvements were found on TIMIT and MediaEval 2011 Spoken Web Search corpus.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2248714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2248714","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/10376/6484971/06469170.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Unsupervised Spoken Term Detection with Spoken Queries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Unsupervised Spoken Term Detection with Spoken Queries","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2013","volume":"21","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13384933","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469170/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Unsupervised Spoken Term Detection with Spoken Queries","sourcePdf":"tasl-chan-2248714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051208S","chronDate":"July  2013","isNumber":"6484971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6469170","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6469172,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Hioka","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Tokyo, Japan","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6472052/6469172/6469172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yusuke Hioka (S'04\u2013M'05\u2013SM'12) received his B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 2000, 2002, and 2005 from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.

These multipliers discard part of the partial products matrix, to reduce hardware cost, and employ extra correction functions to reduce approximation error. While previous papers mainly focus on average error metrics (like mean-square error), we present an in-depth analysis of the maximum absolute error (MAE) of these circuits. The MAE is the main parameter to be considered in important applications, like function evaluation. We describe an efficient numerical method to compute the MAE in fixed-width multipliers and fixed-width multiplier-accumulator (MAC) circuits. Further we present a technique to compute a compensation function, that can be efficiently implemented in hardware, aimed to minimize the MAE. The novel fixed-width multiplier topologies proposed in the paper exhibit a MAE that is better than previously proposed solutions and that is close to the theoretical lower bound. As a practical application we employ the developed MAC with minimum MAE for the hardware computation of elementary functions, using piecewise linear approximation. Implementation results in a 65 nm technology and comparison with previously proposed architectures show that the topologies proposed in this paper allow reducing the MAE without worsening the electrical performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","volume":"60","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13747748","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469188/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-Width Multipliers and Multipliers-Accumulators With Min-Max Approximation Error","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-Width Multipliers and Multipliers-Accumulators With Min-Max Approximation Error","sourcePdf":"tcsi-decaro-2245252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162841S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6587116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6587116","articleId":"6469188","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6469193,"authors":[{"name":"Yoash Levron","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6563116/6469193/6469193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoash Levron received the Ph.D. degree from Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.","His research interests include power electronics, power systems and distributed power management."]},"firstName":"Yoash","lastName":"Levron","id":"37396552600"},{"name":"Josep M.

The problems of simultaneous estimation of frequency and harmonic distortion in a wind farm are investigated. An adaptive and robust application of the STLS algorithm is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters during the dynamic changes due to forced islanding conditions. Equipped with a self-tuning procedure, the algorithm is resistant to noise which significantly improves its accuracy. The system frequency is considered as an unknown model parameter and estimated simultaneously with fundamental and harmonic components. The outcome is an estimation method which is not sensitive to variations of system frequency.

The proposed novel algorithm consists of a linear space-variant edge detector, a low complexity sharpening spatial filter, and a simplified bilinear interpolation. The edge detector is designed to discover the image edges by a low-cost edge-catching technique. The sharpening spatial filter is added as a prefilter to reduce the blurring effect produced by the bilinear interpolation. Furthermore, an adaptive technology is used to enhance the effect of the edge detector by adaptively selecting the input pixels of the bilinear interpolation. In addition, an algebraic manipulation and a hardware sharing techniques are used to simplify bilinear interpolation, which efficiently reduces the computing resources and silicon area in very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits. By adding eight 8-bit registers as a register bank, this design can process streaming data directly and requires only a one-line-buffer memory. The VLSI architecture of this paper contains 6.67-K gate counts and achieves about 280-MHz processing rate by using the TSMC 0.13-um CMOS process. Compared with previous low-complexity techniques, this paper performs with better quality, higher performance, less memory requirements, and lower hardware cost than other image scaling methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13748040","htmlLink":"/document/6469195/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of an Adaptive Edge-Enhanced Image Scalar for Real-Time Multimedia Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of an Adaptive Edge-Enhanced Image Scalar for Real-Time Multimedia Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2248492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166249S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6588337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6588337","articleId":"6469195","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6469205,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhen Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6755472/6469205/6469205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yizhen Tian received the B.Eng. degree from Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China, in 2008 and the M.A.Sc. degree in circuits and system from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2013.","She is currently with the School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University.

A TSCIT2FNN uses type-2 fuzzy sets in an FNN in order to handle the uncertainties associated with information or data in the knowledge base. The antecedent part of each compensatory fuzzy rule is an interval type-2 fuzzy set in the TSCIT2FNN, where compensatory-based fuzzy reasoning uses adaptive fuzzy operation of a neural fuzzy system to make the fuzzy logic system effective and adaptive, and the consequent part is of the TSK type. The TSK-type consequent part is a linear combination of exogenous input variables. Initially, the rule base in the TSCIT2FNN is empty. All rules are derived according to online type-2 fuzzy clustering. For parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are tuned by a variable-expansive Kalman filter algorithm to the reinforce parameter learning ability. The antecedent type-2 fuzzy sets and compensatory weights are learned by a gradient descent algorithm to improve the learning performance. The performance of TSCIT2FNN for the identification is validated and compared with several type-1 and type-2 FNNs.

The RFID reader can measure the phase of the signals coming from responding tags. This phase has non-univocal dependence on the distance robot tag, but in the considered frequency, it is really sensitive to a change in the position of the robot. For this reason, a multihypothesis Kalman filtering approach provides a really satisfactory performance even in the case that a very small density of tags is used: In the experimental tests, an average position estimation error of about 4 cm is achieved using only two tags for an area of about 5 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2248333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6563218/06469211.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2248333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"365","endPage":"376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Robot Localization Using the Phase of Passive UHF RFID Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Robot Localization Using the Phase of Passive UHF RFID Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469211/","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6469211/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13694132","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Robot Localization Using the Phase of Passive UHF RFID Signals","sourcePdf":"tie-martinelli-2248333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099279S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6563218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6563218","articleId":"6469211","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6469213,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Nerg","affiliation":["LUT-Energy, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6734701/6469213/6469213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Janne Nerg (M'99\u2013SM'12) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, the Licentiate of Science (Technology) degree, and the D.Sc.

In particular, sparsity constraints have had a significant impact on sampling theory, where they are used in compressed sensing and allow structured signals to be sampled far below the rate traditionally prescribed. Nearly, all of the theory developed for compressed sensing signal recovery assumes that samples are taken using linear measurements. In this paper, we instead address the compressed sensing recovery problem in a setting where the observations are nonlinear. We show that, under conditions similar to those required in the linear setting, the iterative hard thresholding algorithm can be used to accurately recover sparse or structured signals from few nonlinear observations. Similar ideas can also be developed in a more general nonlinear optimization framework. In the second part of this paper, we therefore present related result that shows how this can be done under sparsity and union of subspaces constraints, whenever a generalization of the restricted isometry property traditionally imposed on the compressed sensing system holds.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6516641/06469229.pdf","startPage":"3466","endPage":"3474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2245716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2245716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Observations and Related Nonlinear Optimization Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Vectors","Compressed sensing","Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","iterative methods","optimisation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear observations","nonlinear optimization problems","nonconvex constraints","sparsity constraints","sampling theory","structured signals","compressed sensing signal recovery","linear measurements","compressed sensing recovery problem","linear setting","iterative hard thresholding algorithm","sparse signals","general nonlinear optimization framework","restricted isometry property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","inverse problems","nonconvex constraints","nonlinear optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Observations and Related Nonlinear Optimization Problems","volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6469229/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13499523","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing With Nonlinear Observations and Related Nonlinear Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tit-blumensath-2245716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134472S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6516641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6516641","articleId":"6469229","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6469237,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano L.

The tendency is to yield classification models that are biased towards the overrepresented (majority) class. This paper investigates this class imbalance problem in the context of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The consequences of the equal cost (loss) assumption on imbalanced data are formally discussed from a statistical learning theory point of view. A new cost-sensitive algorithm (CSMLP) is presented to improve the discrimination ability of (two-class) MLPs. The CSMLP formulation is based on a joint objective function that uses a single cost parameter to distinguish the importance of class errors. The learning rule extends the Levenberg-Marquadt's rule, ensuring the computational efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, it is theoretically demonstrated that the incorporation of prior information via the cost parameter may lead to balanced decision boundaries in the feature space. Based on the statistical analysis of results on real data, our approach shows a significant improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n-mean measures of regular MLPs.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2246188","startPage":"888","endPage":"899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2246188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6494635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6494635/06469237.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Improve the Multilayer Perceptron Performance on Imbalanced Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469237/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Improve the Multilayer Perceptron Performance on Imbalanced Data","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6469237/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13414522","pubMedId":"24808471","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Improve the Multilayer Perceptron Performance on Imbalanced Data","sourcePdf":"tnnls-castro-2246188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117473S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6494635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6494635","articleId":"6469237","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6469239,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6613560/6469239/6469239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Yu (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering and automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2010.

Motivated by recent findings in biological systems, a unified and consistent feedforward system network with a proper encoding scheme and supervised temporal rules is built for solving the pattern recognition task. The temporal rules used for processing precise spiking patterns have recently emerged as ways of emulating the brain's computation from its anatomy and physiology. Most of these rules could be used for recognizing different spatiotemporal patterns. However, there arises the question of whether these temporal rules could be used to recognize real-world stimuli such as images. Furthermore, how the information is represented in the brain still remains unclear. To tackle these problems, a proper encoding method and a unified computational model with consistent and efficient learning rule are proposed. Through encoding, external stimuli are converted into sparse representations, which also have properties of invariance. These temporal patterns are then learned through biologically derived algorithms in the learning layer, followed by the final decision presented through the readout layer. The performance of the model with images of digits from the MNIST database is presented. The results show that the proposed model is capable of recognizing images correctly with a performance comparable to that of current benchmark algorithms. The results also suggest a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of rapid and robust recognition in the brain.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2245677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6613560/06469239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2245677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6613560","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid Feedforward Computation by Temporal Encoding and Learning With Spiking Neurons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Feedforward Computation by Temporal Encoding and Learning With Spiking Neurons","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796290","pubMedId":"24808592","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid Feedforward Computation by Temporal Encoding and Learning With Spiking Neurons","sourcePdf":"tnnls-tang-2245677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106818S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6613560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6613560","articleId":"6469239","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469240,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligence Science and Technology, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6494635/6469240/6469240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Yang received the B.S. degree from Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Hohai University, Nanjing, China.","She is currently a Lecturer with Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai Campus, China.

The MIMO system utilizes a uniform linear antenna array. Instead of increasing the number of antennas or simply changing the parameters of the antenna array, such as separation and geometry, the capacity gain can be obtained by adjusting the weights of multiantenna array groups, because there are few scatterers in strong LOS environments. On the other hand, it is hard to obtain the array gain of MIMO beamforming for HSRs because of drastic changes in the receiving angle when the train travels across E-UTRAN Node B. Without changing the antenna design of Long-Term Evolution systems, this paper proposes a multiple-group multiple-antenna (MGMA) scheme that makes the columns of such a MIMO channel orthogonal by adjusting the weights among MGMA arrays, and the stable capacity gain can be obtained. The value of weights depends on the practical network topologies of the railway wireless communication system. However, the reasonable scope of group number N is less than 6. In selecting N, one important consideration is the tradeoff between practical benefit and cost of implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2244106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6557008/06469255.pdf","startPage":"2558","endPage":"2569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2244106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Multiple-Group Multiple-Antenna (MGMA) Scheme for High-Speed Railway Viaducts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469255/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multiple-Group Multiple-Antenna (MGMA) Scheme for High-Speed Railway Viaducts","volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655119","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469255/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multiple-Group Multiple-Antenna (MGMA) Scheme for High-Speed Railway Viaducts","sourcePdf":"tvt-luo-2244106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122533S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6557008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6557008","articleId":"6469255","onlineDate":"22 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469285,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For this, the Channel State Information(CSI) is required. Since the CSI is not available at the transmitter side, the Channel Phase tracking is used. A novel bisection based phase tracking method is proposed for compensation of channel propagation delay.This eliminates the probability based method which has more computational complexity. The problem of phase tracking is modeled as a minimization problem. The phase is adjusted iteratively similar to finding roots for an algebraic equation using bisection method. Further, the problem of phase adjustment is simplified by considering phase adjustment of single participating sensor in each time slot using Dynamic Programming Technique, instead of collectively adjusting the phase of all participating sensors. This technique is compared with bilateral uniform, Gaussian and Laplacian distribution function. The initial time delay is considered as bilateral uniform distributed and channel propagation delay is modeled as Rayleigh distributed variables. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed for distributed beamforming and results show 66% reduction in computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT.2013.6469285","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6461633/6469280/06469285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT.2013.6469285","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed beamforming for randomly distributed sensors using bisection method and dynamic programming technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jan. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed beamforming for randomly distributed sensors using bisection method and dynamic programming technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469285/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13343471","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed beamforming for randomly distributed sensors using bisection method and dynamic programming technique","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569674037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061986S","chronDate":"17-19 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6461633","isNumber":"6469280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6461633","xplore-issue":"6469280","articleId":"6469285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6469294,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It puts its own priority over the conventional CDMA to provide broadband access in cellular wireless communication. A new overloading scheme for the uplink of cellular CDMA has been proposed in [7] using unequal chip delay spreading (UCDS). It divides all the active users into G groups with each group containing L number of users. Each user in a group is assigned the same orthogonal code, but with different chip durations (multiple of Tc/L). For spreading, all the L Users in a group use the assigned unique code with the insertion of predefined time delay. During spreading each user in a group has to go through unequal time delay between each successive spreading chip. Addition of suitable delays helps in maintaining the correct time alignment among all the users in a group. The receiver uses a very simple orthogonal successive interference cancellation (OSIC) multi user detector in order to recover the message bits of all the users. In this paper, the performance of this new overloading scheme (UCDS-CDMA) with an overloading factor (OF) of TWO has been evaluated with different levels of error in power control. The system model has been designed mainly for the uplink of the cellular CDMA over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The effect of erroneous power control in the uplink of UCDS-CDMA costs a SNR of 1.1 dB, 1.3 dB and 1.6 dB as compared to the conventional perfectly power controlled underloaded CDMA (OF=1) with the power control error of 1 dB, 1.5 dB and 2 dB respectively at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

The advantage of using a multichannel sampling method with causal exponential sampling kernel is that standard annihilating filter or root-finding algorithms are not required.

Therein the focus is mainly set on designing transmission systems towards the application of CS channel estimation, which includes for example the proposal for random pilot patterns in OFDM systems. However, most state of the art OFDM transmission systems are using regular pilot patterns, which is beneficial for classical MMSE channel estimators. This constrains a CS-based channel estimator in its ability to choose frequency measurements at random. With the aim of using CS-based OFDM channel estimation for existing standards we examine the effect of these constraints, and we give some necessary conditions for the existence of a unique solution and good reconstruction properties. In particular, we study the effects at the example of the DVB-T standard, where we will see that it is possible to obtain reconstruction performance comparable to using random pilot patterns.","publicationTitle":"SCC 2013; 9th International ITG Conference on Systems, Communication and Coding","displayPublicationTitle":"SCC 2013; 9th International ITG Conference on Systems, Communication and Coding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6468888/6468889/06469328.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468889","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse OFDM Channel Estimation Based on Regular Pilot Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse OFDM Channel Estimation Based on Regular Pilot Grids","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469328/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse OFDM Channel Estimation Based on Regular Pilot Grids","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"453482007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029418S","chronDate":"21-24 Jan. 2013","isNumber":"6468889","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6468888","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6469328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6469346,"authors":[{"name":"Mathis Seidl","firstName":"Mathis","lastName":"Seidl"},{"name":"Andreas Schenk","firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schenk"},{"name":"Clemens Stierstorfer","firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Stierstorfer"},{"name":"Johannes B.

Ringing frequency observed in the SSN waveforms is strongly related to the anti-resonance peak frequency of total PDN impedance. In this paper, on-board snubber (RC series circuit) was investigated to improve power supply integrity in a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board. The on-board snubber circuits was added just at the beneath of the power supply terminals of the FPGA to effectively suppress the anti-resonance peak of the total PDN impedance. Design space to damp the anti-resonance peak was examined. In particular, the values of on-board capacitance and resistance of snubber circuit has been examined by using circuit analysis tool and field solver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6469429/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13372092","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Anti-resonance peak damping of PDN impedance by on-board snubber circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-resonance peak damping of PDN impedance by on-board snubber circuits","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"10201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075078S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6462538","isNumber":"6469379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6462538","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6469379","articleId":"6469429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6469438,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Te Wu","affiliation":["Dayeh University, Changhua, TW"],"firstName":"Chun-Te","lastName":"Wu","id":"38183374600"},{"name":"Ding-Bing Lin","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Ding-Bing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37271474900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1443-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1444-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1445-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1233"}],"articleNumber":"6469438","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Resistance","Central Processing Unit","SDRAM","Simulation","Equivalent circuits","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","DRAM chips","genetic algorithms","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodule memory bus enhancement","signal integrity","genetic algorithm","lossless transmission line","fitness function","transmission coefficients","reflection coefficients","DIMM structure","impedance mismatching problem","receiver","DDR3 SDRAM","dual in-line memory module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-module memory bus","genetic algorithm (GA)","dual in-line memory module (DIMM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469438","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to optimize the multi-module memory bus by using genetic algorithm.

The aim is to predict the subjective quality scores, known as the mean opinion score (MOS) obtained from human observers. In practice, our metric consists of three stages: first, filtering process is applied to watermarked image in order to generate its filtered image. Second, we use watermarked image and its filtered image in the calculation of the objective metrics as input to a neural network. Third; these metrics are combined using neural network model. The output of this neural network is a single value corresponding to the MOS scores.

learning based on particle swarm optimization","abstract":"In neural network (NN) learning, we usually find an NN to minimize the approximation error for a given training set. Depends on the data given, the performance of the NN can vary significantly. In fact, if the training data are close to the true decision boundary (DB), the NN can generalize well. On the other hand, if the given data are far away from the true DB, the DB formed by the NN can be very different from the original one, and the genelization ability of the NN cannot be high. Based on this observation, we propose a new concept called decision boundary learning (DBL) in this study. A direct way for DBL is to approximate the true DB using a support vector machine (SVM), and then find a set of training patterns using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Experimental results on four public databases show that the training patterns so obtained may generate much better NNs, and in all cases, the NNs are comparable to or better than SVMs, although they are much simpler.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469586/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13397221","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469586/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decision boundary learning based on particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision boundary learning based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"PSI23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047134S","chronDate":"21-24 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459624","isNumber":"6469577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459624","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6469577","articleId":"6469586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6469620,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The limitations of these systems are interoperability and data aggregation across a wide range of devices. To solve these issues, the Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) has evolved as a new paradigm for health care systems, where the patients will have a flexible interaction with the cyber world in order to achieve an optimal decision result. In this paper we propose an architectural design framework for remote health care monitoring system. This framework is a dynamic event based sensing and monitoring system designed by integrating the full functionality of cyber physical system. The system adapts the concept of local and global awareness for intelligent decision making in physical and cyber world.

The edge detective technique predicts luma-4\u00d74, luma16\u00d716, and chroma-8\u00d78 modes directly. We partition the intra prediction procedure into two steps. At the first step, we use the pre-processing mode selection algorithms to find the primary mode which is selected for fast prediction. At the second step, the selected fewer high-potential candidate modes are applied to calculate the RD cost for the mode decision. Simulation results show that the proposed BMA method reduces the encoding time by 75%, and requires bit-rate increase about 2% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease about 0.07 dB in QCIF and CIF sequences, compared with the H.264/AVC JM 14.2 software. The methods achieve less PSNR degradation and bit-rate increase than the previous methods with more encoding time reduction. By implementing with TSMC 0.18\u03bcm CMOS standard cell library, the proposed sub-sampled BMA based processor achieves the full-HD 1920\u00d71080 real-time encoding with 104MHz operational frequency.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469632","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459618/6469631/06469632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2012.6469632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469631","startPage":"24","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast mode selection with sub-sampled based block matching algorithm and architecture design for H.264/AVC fast intra prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast mode selection with sub-sampled based block matching algorithm and architecture design for H.264/AVC fast intra prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469632/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13387352","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469632/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast mode selection with sub-sampled based block matching algorithm and architecture design for H.264/AVC fast intra prediction","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073367S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6469673,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Fang","affiliation":["School of Science, Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Fang","id":"38554574700"},{"name":"Hairong Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing Signal Processing, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hairong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38549151700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6469673","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Image reconstruction","Accuracy","Reconstruction algorithms","Compressed sensing","Minimization","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","greedy algorithms","image coding","image reconstruction","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing-based matching pursuit algorithm","image reconstruction","discrete signal","signal compression","iterative greedy reconstruction algorithm","sparsity adaptive matching pursuit","SAMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image reconstruction","matching pursuit algorithm","compressive sensing","sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"Compressed Sensing (CS), a popular technique which seeks to capture a discrete signal with a small number of linear measurements, could be used to compress a signal during the process of sampling. As an iterative greedy reconstruction algorithm for practical CS, sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) takes advantage of the capability of signal reconstruction without prior information of the sparsity in the process of resuming the original high-dimension-data from low-dimension measurement. This paper presents a backward and adaptive matching pursuit reconstruction algorithm with fixed step sizes to avoid the overestimation phenomena of SAMP by using a standard regularized approach. Firstly, a fixed and biggish step size is set to make sure the size of support set of the signal to be reconstructed increasing stably. The energy difference between adjacent reconstructed signals is then taken as the halting condition of iteration. A standard regularized approach is employed to post-dispose the final iteration results, which backward eliminates superfluous atoms to acquire exact reconstruction. Experimental results show that such an improvement of SAMP is feasible in technology and effective in acquiring quick and exact reconstruction with sufficient measurement.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469673","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459618/6469631/06469673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2012.6469673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469631","startPage":"338","endPage":"342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new compressed sensing-based matching pursuit algorithm for image reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new compressed sensing-based matching pursuit algorithm for image reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13387393","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6469673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new compressed sensing-based matching pursuit algorithm for image reconstruction","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04379S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6469676,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Xie","affiliation":["Shenzhen Digital Home Key Technology Engineering Laboratory, Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086710806"},{"name":"Hefeng Wu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Digital Home Key Technology Engineering Laboratory, Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hefeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37898860700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6469676","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469676","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Target tracking","Computer vision","Robustness","Object tracking","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","object tracking","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary keypoint descriptor","real-time computer vision problems","nearest neighbor search method","sample consensus method","multiple object transformation models","pruning outliers","video clips","random model","ORB tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object tracking","ORB features","RANSAC","transformation models"]}],"abstract":"The ORB feature is a fast binary keypoint descriptor that is efficient enough to be applied to many real-time computer vision problems.

Simulations show that the combination of BSP interleaving with RS code is more robust than that of SP interleaving with BCH code on burst errors in two dimensional space.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469681","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459618/6469631/06469681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2012.6469681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469631","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An interleaving approach of enhancing the performance of RS codes in two dimensional space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469681/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13387401","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interleaving approach of enhancing the performance of RS codes in two dimensional space","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048582S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6469683,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, the performance of MFCC-based audio recognition degrades due to noise interference. In consideration of this, we propose the matching pursuit (MP) sparse representation algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) improved by elite strategy and evolution reversal to accomplish the task of filtering out extraneous noise. In the first step, MP is carried out to represent the ecological environmental signal's inner structure. The second step consists of MFCCs feature extraction. Finally, two different classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) were performed and compared using the proposed features. Experimental results showed that the SVM-based classifier outperforms the GMM classifier and indicated that this method with sparse representation achieved improved performance in noisy environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469861/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13387611","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469861/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ecological environmental sounds classification based on genetic algorithm and matching pursuit sparse decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ecological environmental sounds classification based on genetic algorithm and matching pursuit sparse decomposition","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"2112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056344S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6469868,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanfeng Wang","affiliation":["Electronic engineering and electrical automation College, Chaohu University, Chaohu, China"],"firstName":"Zhanfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38551696600"},{"name":"Suping Li","affiliation":["Electronic engineering and electrical automation College, Chaohu University, Chaohu, China"],"firstName":"Suping","lastName":"Li","id":"37715567000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6469868","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Wavelet packets","Noise reduction","Noise","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","signal denoising","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform","computer simulation","speech denoising","discrete wavelet packet transform","wavelet packet coefficient","speech frequency feature","denoised wavelet coefficient","artificial noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer simulation","speech denoising","Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform","Fourier Transform"]}],"abstract":"The paper aims to emphasize the importance of computer simulation in speech denoising area by comparing Fourier Transform to Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform.

So it is a great practical significance to research of TD-LTE termination testing instrument with integrated testing function of RF, physical layer, protocol stack. As an important testing indicator of TD-LTE termination RF conformance, error vector magnitude (EVM) is used to measure modulated signal quality efficiently and integrally, witch is relative offset between symbol before demodulation and ideal symbol at receiver. So far, EVM measurement algorithm in TD-LTE system has not been reasonably considered, especially there is a lack of accurate and clipping measurement. To solve the problem, from the theory of EVM calculation, based on physical uplink share channel, an effective EVM measurement of frequency offset compensation has been proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the reference symbol has been directly frequency offset compensated after hard decision in the demodulation forward module to avoid the influence of frequency error.

Its performance would critically affect other subsequent operations such as object detection and recognition. Color image enhancement, with simultaneous noise reduction and contrast preservation, is one of the difficult problems to be tackled. Among the possible approaches available, bilateral filtering (BF) is known for its specially designed features that address the enhancement problem. However, it still remains non-trivial to determine proper filter coefficient settings. This challenge is here cast as an optimization problem on filter parameters. In particular, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted for its solution quality and implementation simplicity. Filter coefficients are coded as particles and solutions are iteratively improved against the signal-to-noise criterion. Experiments are conducted on publicly available color images.

As natural signals can always be represented sparsely using a given dictionary, some effective sparse-based algorithms are developed for target detection. However, this kind of method is extremely dependent on the spectra library, a huge dictionary data set from which useful information is extracted. This provides mathematical challenge for its efficiency of programming. Under such circumstances, we propose a novel algorithm called dimension reduction based sparse detector (DRSD), which aims to eliminate the calculation process by building a smaller new spectra library. In addition, as the detection result is based on the sparse reconstruction the algorithm provide, we utilize effective approximate solver to find sparse reconstruction within the new spectra library. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective than current applied sparse algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2012.6469896","startPage":"972","endPage":"976","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459618/6469631/06469896.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dimension reduction model for sparse hyperspectral target detection with weighted \u2113<inf>1</inf> minimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A dimension reduction model for sparse hyperspectral target detection with weighted \u2113<inf>1</inf> minimization","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469896/","accessionNumber":"13382815","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469896/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dimension reduction model for sparse hyperspectral target detection with weighted \u2113<inf>1</inf> minimization","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"3133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071534S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6469936,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ren","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Xi'an Aeronautical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ren","id":"38552126800"},{"name":"Jie Hao","affiliation":["Xi'an Aeronautical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Hao","id":"38550669300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6469936","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"abstract":"This paper proposes a tracking algorithm that combines Mean Shift with Kalman Filter.

To avoid the difficulty, this paper proposes a high-resolution imaging method via airborne multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar based on a hybrid sampling procedure, where the single snapshot of MIMO radar and the synthetic aperture of SAR are combined. Different from the classical SAR, the novel method only compensates the movement by the geographic information between the target and the airborne radar, not need of the Doppler information. Therefore, the difficulty associated with the Doppler estimation in SAR imaging procedure can effectively be avoided. Simulation results prove the availability of the proposed algorithm for the maneuvering target imaging.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Radar imaging","Imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","MIMO radar","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","Doppler radar","image resolution","image restoration","image sampling","MIMO radar","motion compensation","motion estimation","parameter estimation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maneuvering target imaging method","hybrid sampling procedure","motion parameter estimation","airborne synthetic aperture radar","defocus-blurred SAR image","high-resolution imaging method","airborne multiple-input-and-multiple-output radar","MIMO radar","movement compensation","geographic information","Doppler estimation","SAR imaging procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input and multiple-output radar","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","maneuvering target","parameter estimating"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469997","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6459618/6469631/06469997.pdf","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2012.6469997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An imaging method of maneuvering target based on hybrid sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6469997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An imaging method of maneuvering target based on hybrid sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6469997/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6469997/","accessionNumber":"13382916","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An imaging method of maneuvering target based on hybrid sampling","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"3831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068221S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6459618","isNumber":"6469631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459618","xplore-issue":"6469631","articleId":"6469997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"}]
