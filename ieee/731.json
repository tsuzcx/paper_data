This paper analyzes different power stage implementations of switched-mode (Class-D) amplifiers intended for such applications. They are preferred to linear or hybrid solutions as they feature a high output power with a good efficiency at low cost and low complexity. The advent of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors based on gallium nitride (GaN) or silicon carbide (SiC) enables Class-D amplifiers with unprecedented performance regarding distortion and bandwidth. Comprehensive circuit simulations incorporating detailed switch- and thermal models of all relevant components are used to compare different implementations of Class-D switching stages based on GaN and SiC semiconductors with respect to output voltage distortion. The systems' sensitivities to various parameters such as power circuit topology or output current amplitude are derived as a performance measure. It is shown that the thermal behavior of the power devices has significant influence on the output distortion and that the dual buck topology, which requires no dead time in between the turn-off and the turn-on of the bridge leg transistors, is less sensitive to parameter variations and has a better distortion performance than the conventional half bridge topology.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310020","startPage":"2563","endPage":"2571","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310020.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion analysis of low-THD/high-bandwidth GaN/SiC class-D amplifier power stages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distortion analysis of low-THD/high-bandwidth GaN/SiC class-D amplifier power stages","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310020/","accessionNumber":"15569664","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310020/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion analysis of low-THD/high-bandwidth GaN/SiC class-D amplifier power stages","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"03661544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081722S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310029,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongfei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xiongfei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540100400"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"},{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Poh Chiang","lastName":"Loh","id":"37275742000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310029","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"abstract":"Active damping of LCL-filter resonance based on single-state feedback control is widely used with voltage source converters. Its robustness against grid impedance variation has always been a major concern with its controller design. To deal with this issue, this paper begins by developing a generalized impedance-based model of grid current control with feedback-type active damping. Then, a controller design method based on the z-domain root contours and frequency-domain passivity theorem is proposed. It not only allows a co-design of the grid current controller and damping controller, but ensures also a robust stabilization against the grid parameters variations. For illustration, the approach is applied to design three single-state feedback-damping schemes, and their damping robustness are compared under both inductive and resonant grid impedances.

By this way, an extra current sensor can be avoided. Compared with the existing active damping techniques designed with capacitor current feedback, the capacitor voltage feedback active damping would however demand a noise-sensitive derivative term. A digital realization of this derivative term is generally a challenge with many methods developed for resolving it. However, these methods are still facing drawbacks, which have been comprehensively explained in this paper. To overcome their drawbacks, a new derivative method is then proposed, based on the non-ideal generalized integrator. The performance of the proposed derivative has been found to match the ideal \u201cs\u201d function closely.

In this paper, a descriptive approach of the circuit theory with normalized resistance is proposed and applied to the analysis of relay resonators using four important factors: the source matching factor, the load matching factor, the transfer quality factor, and the reflected impedance factor. The explicit closed-form expressions of currents and efficiency in the general n-resonator RWPT system are deduced. Maximum efficiency can be obtained at a particular load resistance, but the resonator currents may differ greatly. For identical relay resonators, the resonator currents should be equalized in order to achieve the highest system power level. Uniform current distribution and uniform spacing distribution with equal reflected impedances are analyzed. The latter is proved to achieve approximately equal currents and relatively high efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310090","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310090.pdf","startPage":"3077","endPage":"3081","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing power level of resonant wireless power transfer with relay resonators by considering resonator current amplitudes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Increasing power level of resonant wireless power transfer with relay resonators by considering resonator current amplitudes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569868","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310090/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing power level of resonant wireless power transfer with relay resonators by considering resonator current amplitudes","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"04380050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048341S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310139,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi, India"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37085665058"},{"name":"R.

The control-to-output transfer function of a conventional quadratic boost converter reveals that right half plane (RHP) zero exist, which makes the controller design difficult. The device has to operate on extremely high duty cycle (to get high voltage conversion) and this leads to severe reverse recovery problem and increases EMI. In this paper, a modular magnetically coupled quadratic boost (MMCQB) topology with damping network for DC microgrid is proposed. The proposed topology consists of a magnetically coupled quadratic boost converter with damping network and a modular controller. In the proposed MMCQB converter the inductors of a quadratic boost converter are magnetically coupled and damping network is introduced. This arrangement facilitates complete elimination of RHP zero and thereby making it a minimum phase system unlike the conventional quadratic boost converter. This also facilitates simple controller design and better dynamic performance. The proposed MMCQB converter provides high step-up gain of 17-18 times. The proposed MMCQB topology is capable of accepting both DC and AC microsources. Detailed design and analysis of the MMCQB topology are carried out. Steady state and dynamic modeling are carried out to exhibit the advantages of the MMCQB topology. Finally, a prototype circuit is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310139/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569779","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of a modular magnetically coupled quadratic boost topology with a damping network for DC microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of a modular magnetically coupled quadratic boost topology with a damping network for DC microgrid","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"04871354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075863S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7310156,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Abarzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Faculty, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Abarzadeh","id":"37589795500"},{"name":"Hossein Madadi Kojabadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Faculty, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein Madadi","lastName":"Kojabadi","id":"37266309200"},{"name":"Liuchen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada"],"firstName":"Liuchen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37278238600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310156","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"abstract":"Static power converters have widespread applications, such as ground power units (GPU) for airplanes.

The output voltage has the harmonics around the 2k times of switching frequency where k is the integer number. It results in smaller passive components that can satisfy the THD requirement for AC currents.

The present paper performs a steady-state analysis of the modular multilevel converter (MMC) based on average model. The magnitudes and phase angles of current and voltage quantities are calculated. The equations are solved for different components of the circulating current and submodule voltage, and the resonance behavior in circulating current harmonics is investigated. Based on resonance behavior of circulating current harmonics, a guideline is given to choose the magnitude of submodule capacitance and arm inductance.

However, the NPC Multilevel topology also has variable type of structure which cannot be found due to lack of systematic derivation methodology. A new system method, called NPC Flow Graph (NPC-FG), is proposed to derive all the possible topologies in this paper, which sets the basic criteria and special steps to construct topologies. Thirty-two NPC five-level topologies have been derived. Among them, a new family of Space NPC (S-NPC) multilevel topologies is also proposed by NPC-FG. Additional topologies can be derived based on different criteria to meet special requirement, such as Photovoltaic (PV) application. The proposed method can find all the existing multi-level NPC topologies, as well as new ones, with better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310171/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neutral point clamped multilevel topology flow graph and space NPC multilevel topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neutral point clamped multilevel topology flow graph and space NPC multilevel topology","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"05191005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067082S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7310175,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Brueske","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics, Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Brueske","id":"37085479256"},{"name":"Berthold Benkendorff","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics, Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Berthold","lastName":"Benkendorff","id":"37085654246"},{"name":"Robert Kulpe","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics, Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Kulpe","id":"37085739122"},{"name":"Friedrich W.

However, conventional design methods of passive dampers are based on the passive components only, while the inherent damping effect of time delay in the digital control system is overlooked. In this paper, a frequency-domain passivity-based design approach is proposed, where the passive dampers are designed to eliminate the negative real part of the converter output admittance with closed-loop current control, rather than shaping the LCL-filter itself. Thus, the influence of time delay in the current control is included, which allows a relaxed design of the passive damper with the reduced power loss and improved stability robustness against grid parameters variations.

A lot of effort has been dedicated to investigating the power stage control of VSG, but the waveform quality of VSG is not fully discussed. This paper analyses a VSG with an inner voltage loop to attenuate waveform distortion influenced by dead-time effect. And main parts of the voltage loop are voltage regulator and active damping of the LCL filter. Generally speaking, the voltage regulator attenuates the influence of dead-time effect, and the active damping suppresses the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. Based on the proportional-resonant (PR) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active damping which is widely used for their effectiveness and simple implementations, a step-by-step design method of the controller parameters for voltage loop is proposed. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the voltage regulator and active damping, the satisfactory regions of the controller parameters for meeting the system specifications are obtained, from which the controller parameters can be easily picked out. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of inner voltage loop.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310191.pdf","startPage":"3760","endPage":"3765","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310191","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310191","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Pulse width modulation","Gain","Power harmonic filters","Resonant frequency","Distortion","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","machine control","power capacitors","power filters","synchronous generators","voltage control","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor-current-feedback","proportional-resonant compensator","resonance peak","LCL filter","active damping","voltage regulator","dead time effect","waveform distortion","inner voltage loop","voltage closed-loop control","step-by-step controller","virtual synchronous generator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310191/","displayDocTitle":"Step-by-step controller design of voltage closed-loop control for virtual synchronous generator","accessionNumber":"15570143","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310191/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Step-by-step controller design of voltage closed-loop control for virtual synchronous generator","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"05390168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045112S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310203,"authors":[{"name":"Serkan Dusmez","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Science Department, University of Texas at Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Dusmez","id":"37892379600"},{"name":"Bilal Akin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Science Department, University of Texas at Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Bilal","lastName":"Akin","id":"37265639900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310203","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":559},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Degradation","Trajectory","Semiconductor device modeling","Data models","MOSFET","Thermal degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","estimation theory","Kalman filters","power MOSFET","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor device testing","thermal analysis","thermal stresses","vibrations","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power MOSFET","cyclic thermal stress","power semiconductor devices","power converter failures","electrolytic DC bus capacitors","mechanical stresses","electrical stresses","remaining useful lifetime","RUL estimation","thermal cycling","on-state resistance","device ageing platform","exponential degradation model","Kalman filter"]}],"abstract":"Power semiconductor devices are the major cause of the power converter failures together with the electrolytic dc bus capacitors. In harsh operating environments, the power devices are subjected to various mechanical and electrical stresses, wear, and vibration that contribute to increased equipment failure rate, where a failed component can cause unexpected interruptions, serious safety issues, or easily account for millions of dollars in repair costs. Developing prognosis tools is vital for the reliability of these systems. This paper focuses on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of degraded power MOSFETs which are stressed by thermal cycling. The relative change in on-state resistance is identified as the fault signature. A multiple device ageing platform is designed and built to collect experimental data. An exponential degradation model that fits successfully with the experimental data is developed. The experimental data is processed with Kalman Filter, and RUL estimation with limited field data is demonstrated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310203.pdf","endPage":"3851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remaining useful lifetime estimation for degraded power MOSFETs under cyclic thermal stress","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310203","startPage":"3846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Remaining useful lifetime estimation for degraded power MOSFETs under cyclic thermal stress","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310203/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15570323","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310203/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remaining useful lifetime estimation for degraded power MOSFETs under cyclic thermal stress","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"05511436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057557S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310219,"authors":[{"name":"Fangzhou Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Fangzhou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085701211"},{"name":"Liyan Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Liyan","lastName":"Qu","id":"37413304000"},{"name":"Wei Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37545084000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310219","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prognostics and health management","Libraries","Predictive models","Data models","Feature extraction","Time series analysis","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","machine bearings","maintenance engineering","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine fault prognostic method","case-based data-driven prediction framework","condition-based maintenance","adaptive neurofuzzy inference system","ANFIS","Big Data concept","offline learning phase","bearing fault","bearing test rig"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)","condition-based maintenance (CBM)","case-based method","data-driven method","multistep-ahead prediction","prognosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310219","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310219.pdf","startPage":"3957","endPage":"3963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A case-based data-driven prediction framework for machine fault prognostics","abstract":"Fault prognosis is an important step to achieve condition-based maintenance for machinery systems. The existing fault prognostic methods can generally be categorized into three major classes: case-based, data-driven, and model-based methods. This paper proposes a novel case-based data-driven prognostic framework based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and big data concept. The framework contains two phases. One is an offline learning phase, in which big historical data are used to build an ANFIS model-case library. The other is the online prognostic phase, in which the fault prognosis of a new machinery system (i.e., a new case) is accomplished by using the proper ANFIS model(s) chosen from the model-case library. The proposed framework is tested by using the experimental data of bearing faults collected from a bearing test rig. Result shows that it has better fault prognostic accuracy than the traditional data-driven method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310219/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569487","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A case-based data-driven prediction framework for machine fault prognostics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case-based data-driven prediction framework for machine fault prognostics","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"05671461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051643S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310229,"authors":[{"name":"Alinaghi Marzoughi","affiliation":["The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Alinaghi","lastName":"Marzoughi","id":"37085508589"},{"name":"Rolando Burgos","affiliation":["The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Rolando","lastName":"Burgos","id":"37270043300"},{"name":"Dushan Boroyevich","affiliation":["The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dushan","lastName":"Boroyevich","id":"37274991300"},{"name":"Yaosuo Xue","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yaosuo","lastName":"Xue","id":"37536423800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310229","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":985},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Capacitors","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Rectifiers","Semiconductor diodes","Capacitance","Motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate bipolar transistors","motor drives","power convertors","pulse transformers","rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascaded H-bridge converter","modular multilevel converter","active neutral point clamped topologies","medium-voltage industrial motor drive application","high-power industrial motor drive application","insulated gate bipolar transistor","IGBT","leakage parameters","multi-pulse transformer","diode front-end rectifier stage","voltage 1.7 kV","voltage 3.3 kV","voltage 4.5 kV","voltage 4.16 kV","voltage 6.9 kV","voltage 13.8 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC)","Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB)","5-L Active Neutral Point Clamped (ANPC)","Medium-Voltage High-Power Motor Drive"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the design procedure of cascaded H-bridge (CHB), modular multilevel converter (MMC) and five-level active neutral point clamped (5-L ANPC) topologies for medium-voltage and high-power industrial motor drive application.

Operating at 27.12 MHz allows for small value and size resonant passive components to be implemented using traces on or within a PCB. Previous work [1]-[14] has demonstrated various ways of using PCBs to make inductors and capacitors. In this work, we evaluate a design with goals of achieving good power density, good EMI shielding, (relatively) low manufacturing cost, and the potential to operate in harsh environments (e.g. strong external magnetic field). Specifically, the proposed prototype converter consists of four vertically stacked PCBs. Two low cost 3.2 mm thick FR4 PCBs are used to make the air core toroidal inductors, and the resonant capacitors are implemented using two low-dielectric-loss thin Rogers PCBs and located in the middle of the stack. To help reduce leakage fields from inducing eddy current within the EMI shield, each resonant inductor is formed by the series/parallel combination of two vertically aligned opposite wound toroids placed in different PCBs. In this arrangement, the circumferential currents of the two inductors flow in opposite directions to cancel the axial \u201cone turn\u201d inductance. Capacitors are formed by two thin layers of high frequency laminates to minimize loss and avoid capacitive heating in the lossy FR4 material. A prototype dc-dc converter was built to verify the concept and it reaches an efficiency of 73.6%. A simulated loss analysis is also presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310260.pdf","endPage":"4256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"27.12MHz GaN resonant power converter with PCB embedded resonant air core inductors and capacitors","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310260","startPage":"4251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"27.12MHz GaN resonant power converter with PCB embedded resonant air core inductors and capacitors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310260/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15569705","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310260/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"27.12MHz GaN resonant power converter with PCB embedded resonant air core inductors and capacitors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"06081329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114069S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310269,"authors":[{"name":"Ozan Gulbudak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA"],"firstName":"Ozan","lastName":"Gulbudak","id":"37085341148"},{"name":"Janosch Marquart","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Systems University of Applied Science NTB Buchs SG, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Janosch","lastName":"Marquart","id":"37085346253"},{"name":"Enrico Santi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Santi","id":"37278228700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310269","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Matrix converters","Commutation","Real-time systems","Predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","matrix convertors","optimal control","optimisation","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based model predictive current controller","direct matrix converter","single stage AC-AC power converter topology","optimization-based control method","user-defined cost function","optimum control action","fast dynamic response","very high computational burden","hardware resource","DMC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model Predictive Control (MPC)","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","Digital Control","Matrix Converter"]}],"abstract":"The Direct Matrix Converter (DMC) is a single stage ac-ac power converter topology having no bulk energy storage elements.

In present, a transformer, which is designed to satisfy the safety standards, provides galvanic isolation. However, transformers prevent cost reduction of the isolation system. In this paper, the galvanic isolation system using only printed circuit boards are proposed. Moreover, a three-phase inverter is driven using the isolation system in order to confirm the utility of the isolation system. The proposed system transmits power from the transmitting board to six receiving boards using each transmitting coils made on the printed circuit boards.

IPM machines typically utilize Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets, which pose an issue in terms of price, sustainability, demagnetization at higher operating temperatures, and uncontrolled generation. On the other hand, SynRel machines do not contain any magnets and are free from these issues. However, the absence of magnets as well the presence of bridges and centerpost limit the flux-weakening capability of a SynRel machine and limit the achievable constant power speed ratio (CPSR) for a given power converter rating. In this paper, a new material referred to as the dual-phase magnetic material will be evaluated for SynRel designs. This material allows for non-magnetic regions to be selectively introduced in the bridge and post regions, thereby eliminating one of the key limitations of the SynRel designs in terms of torque density and flux-weakening. This paper will focus on advanced SynRel designs utilizing dual-phase material targeting traction applications. The paper will provide a detailed comparison between a dual-phase SynRel design, a conventional SynRel design and a spoke PM design with rare-earth-free magnets. It will highlight the key tradeoffs in terms of power density, efficiency, and flux-weakening capability.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310339.pdf","startPage":"4812","endPage":"4819","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of synchronous reluctance motor utilizing dual-phase material for traction applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of synchronous reluctance motor utilizing dual-phase material for traction applications","htmlLink":"/document/7310339/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15569554","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of synchronous reluctance motor utilizing dual-phase material for traction applications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"06950532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068257S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310375,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Raymond","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Luke","lastName":"Raymond","id":"37078407700"},{"name":"Wei Liang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liang","id":"38667752200"},{"name":"Kawin Surakitbovorn","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Kawin","lastName":"Surakitbovorn","id":"37085486726"},{"name":"Juan Rivas Davila","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Juan Rivas","lastName":"Davila","id":"37085663668"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":566},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"27.12 MHz isolated high voltage gain multi-level resonant DC-DC converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Schottky diodes","DC-DC power converters","Silicon","Voltage measurement","Density measurement","Power system measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","impedance matching","passive networks","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolated high voltage gain multilevel resonant DC-DC converter","fast transient response DC-DC converter design","low-voltage input","switching frequency","capacitive isolation","impedance matching","passive matching networks","frequency 27.12 MHz","power 100 W","voltage 2000 V","voltage 40 V","voltage 100 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper demonstrates a high efficiency, high power density, and fast transient response dc-dc converter design capable of providing a high-voltage isolated output from a low-voltage input.

This paper firstly deduces the precise model of the Neutral-Point (NP) voltage in frequency domain based on CB-PWM. At the same time, a novel plug-in repetitive controller and PI controller are used to calculate the zero-sequence voltage injected. The proposed method can suppress low-frequency NP fluctuation which contains mainly third order harmonic in steady state and gain a smooth regulation in dynamic process compared with the conventional method. In addition, a Dual Sampling and Dual PWM duty ratio Update (DSDPU) scheme is used to expand the bandwidth of Neutral-Point (NP) balancing controller. The proposed concept will help extend in the NTSV PWM. Performance of the presented strategy for neutral-point balancing is also experimentally verified.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Voltage

switching power electronic converter technology have brought about a resurgence of interest in the use of DC power distribution systems for a variety of applications. However, the notional power electronic based DC distribution system is a complex and extensively interconnected system consisting of multiple power converters. As a result, a number of system-level challenges related to stability arise due to interaction among multiple converter subsystems. The design of this type of system is difficult due to the general lack of proper analysis tools and limited understanding of the problem. This paper addresses the stability analysis of multi-bus MVDC converter systems using an unterminated two-port modeling technique to construct the impedance of all system buses. Evaluation of these system bus impedances utilizing the recently proposed Passivity Based Stability Criterion allows for a proper determination of overall system stability. A stabilizing controller is designed using a Positive Feed-Forward control technique to ensure passivity of the system buses and guarantee stability and performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15570284","htmlLink":"/document/7310389/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing controller design for multi-bus MVDC distribution systems using a passivity based stability criterion and positive feed-forward control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing controller design for multi-bus MVDC distribution systems using a passivity based stability criterion and positive feed-forward control","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"07541270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058847S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310398,"authors":[{"name":"Lesedi Masisi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Lesedi","lastName":"Masisi","id":"37660525100"},{"name":"Maged Ibrahim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37957291400"},{"name":"Pragasen Pillay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Pragasen","lastName":"Pillay","id":"37272823000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310398","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetization","Magnetic flux","Torque","Magnetic separation","Mathematical model","Demagnetization","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","cobalt compounds","nickel compounds","permanent magnet machines","permanent magnets","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control strategy","variable flux machine","permanent magnets","vector controller","variable flux inset permanent magnet synchronous machine","VF-IPMSM","aluminum-nickel-cobalt permanent magnets","stator winding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable Flux Machine (VFM)","Permanent Magnets (PMs)","d-axis current","demagnetization","remnant flux","coercive force"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310398","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the development of a vector controller for a variable flux inset permanent magnet synchronous machine (VF-IPMSM).

The demagnetization of the permanent magnets (PMs) is conducted on the stator winding of the machine hence there is no separate winding for the excitation of the PMs. The proposed control method incorporates field weakening for smooth transitions between torque and speed from a higher magnetization state to a lower one. The benefits of the variable flux over a normal insert permanent magnet synchronous machine during field weakening operation are demonstrated.

The operation principle of the active damper is to mimic a damping resistance at the resonance frequencies. However, the selection of the damping resistance has not received much attention. Also, parasitic capacitance of the grid transmission line brings new challenge for the application of an active damper, which has not been discussed before. In order to fill these gaps, this paper first analyzes the stability of a grid-tied converter with the help of passivity. Based on the passivity-based-stability-analysis, a damping resistance selection method is proposed. Then, an admittance shaping method is developed to ensure the system stability in the presence of parasitic capacitance of the transmission line. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the validity of the proposed methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310478","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310478.pdf","startPage":"5830","endPage":"5837","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity enhancement of grid-tied converter by series LC-filtered active damper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Passivity enhancement of grid-tied converter by series LC-filtered active damper","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570221","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity enhancement of grid-tied converter by series LC-filtered active damper","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08471373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08146S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7310482,"authors":[{"name":"Ramanujam Ramabhadran","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY"],"firstName":"Ramanujam","lastName":"Ramabhadran","id":"37354878200"},{"name":"Xu She","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"She","id":"37580357700"},{"name":"Yehuda Levy","affiliation":["GE Lighting, Israel"],"firstName":"Yehuda","lastName":"Levy","id":"37085658071"},{"name":"John Glaser","affiliation":["Efficient Power Conversion, El Segundo, CA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Glaser","id":"37268669600"},{"name":"Ravisekhar Raju","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY"],"firstName":"Ravisekhar","lastName":"Raju","id":"37299882200"},{"name":"Rajib Datta","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY"],"firstName":"Rajib","lastName":"Datta","id":"37289346900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310482","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"abstract":"In this paper, we present the design and fabrication of a high density laptop adapter with a Clamped Series Resonant Converter (CSRC), as a possible alternative to traditional Flyback converters for power adapters in portable electronics.

The converter is frequency controlled, and all switches exhibit Zero-Current Switching (ZCS). In this paper, we show that by utilizing the magnetizing inductance, the converter can be tuned for Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS), and by adding a switched capacitor circuit to extend the input voltage range, we can realize a very compact design that is suitable for power adapters with or without power factor correction. Low transformer stresses compared to Flyback type designs enable high densities, even with a resonant magnetic. Prototype test results with a 45 W laptop adapter are presented. Our initial testing with diode rectification indicated very good efficiency. Versions with synchronous rectification promise higher efficiencies by at least 1%, which will be ideal for energy saving low power devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Capacitors","Magnetic resonance","Magnetic switching","Zero voltage switching","Stress","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power factor correction","resonant power convertors","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal AC input high density power adapter design","clamped series resonant converter","high density laptop adapter","flyback converters","power adapters","portable electronics","zero-current switching","ZCS","zero voltage switching","switched capacitor circuit","power factor correction","diode rectification","synchronous rectification","energy saving low power devices","power 100 W","power 45 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310482","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310482.pdf","startPage":"5857","endPage":"5864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal AC input high density power adapter design with a Clamped Series Resonant Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Universal AC input high density power adapter design with a Clamped Series Resonant Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310482/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310482/","accessionNumber":"15569443","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal AC input high density power adapter design with a Clamped Series Resonant Converter","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"08510300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053433S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310492,"authors":[{"name":"Ayslan C.N.

This work extends on that previously published by inducing varying degrees of assembly misalignment of the stator and rotor to determine the effect on cogging torque waveforms. Experimental data is presented supporting the analytical data indicating that static and dynamic eccentricity produce first and second order sidebands about the rotor and stator affected harmonics respectively.

To control power flows in DC power networks, voltage of each terminal is usually an only controllable variable. Therefore, implementation of control method is generally simple, but it lacks flexibility particularly when the structure of the power network is complicated. To overcome the problem, a more flexible power flow control method that includes a power flow controller implemented on the distributed line has been proposed. The controller makes additional voltage differences on the distribution line and realizes bidirectional and flexible power flow control. In this paper, we consider DC power networks with complicated connections of DG and ES systems. For implementing simple and intuitive power flow control, we propose a multi-terminal power flow control method that consists of a multi-terminal power flow controller (MTPFC) and a compensation node for MTPFC. The control method makes the DC power network simpler and enables to realize flexible and robust power flow control. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed control method are validated by experimental studies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310533.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310533","startPage":"6223","endPage":"6230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-terminal power flow control method for next-generation DC power network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310533/","displayDocTitle":"A multi-terminal power flow control method for next-generation DC power network","htmlLink":"/document/7310533/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15569844","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-terminal power flow control method for next-generation DC power network","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"09021538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088626S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7310551,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Karwatzki","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Karwatzki","id":"37085371921"},{"name":"Lennart Baruschka","affiliation":["Protolar GmbH, Hannover, Germany","Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Lennart","lastName":"Baruschka","id":"38018254700"},{"name":"Jakub Kucka","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Kucka","id":"37085591595"},{"name":"Axel Mertens","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Mertens","id":"37085475531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310551","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current control","Topology","Matrix converters","Voltage control","Inductors","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","matrix convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current control","branch energy balancing","modular multilevel matrix converter"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an alternative approach for analysing and controlling the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter.

Shunt active power filters (SAPFs) only compensate the harmonic currents or suppress harmonic resonance, which may not be sufficient to meet a good power quality. This paper investigates harmonic suppression and resonance damping combined control for SAPF with selective closed-loop regulation of PCC voltage. Firstly, a recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT) algorithm is utilized to extract the harmonic suppression current reference from nonlinear load. Then, a novel selective closed-loop regulation of PCC voltage is proposed to damp harmonic resonance. Meanwhile, a zero steady-state error control strategy composed of ordinary PI controller and advanced repetitive controller in parallel under synchronous rotation frame is adopted to improve the output current tracking accuracy of SAPF. Finally, a lot of simulation and laboratory test results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the suggested control tactics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310561/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569542","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic suppression and resonance damping for shunt APF with selective closed-loop regulation of PCC voltage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic suppression and resonance damping for shunt APF with selective closed-loop regulation of PCC voltage","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"09300745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049695S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310579,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253500"},{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085384258"},{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37272480000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310579","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":494},"abstract":"This paper studies the modeling, switching strategy and control scheme for NPC three-level (NPC-3L) inverter fed dual-three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives.

The purpose is to determine which one allows to achieve the highest final performance when adopted as the inner current control loop in a microgrid utility interface converter. The utility interface operation in the microgrid, as either a voltage supporting or a voltage forming converter, needs a fast output voltage control loop. In order to achieve a large bandwidth voltage regulation, with effective load disturbance rejection, the inner current loop small-signal bandwidth needs to be maximized. To prevent saturation of the voltage loop, a fast large-signal response of the current controller is also beneficial. The paper analyzes the above current controllers and compares their small-signal bandwidths and large-signal reference tracking performance. The better performing controller is then used in a multi-loop voltage control for the utility interface converter. Experimental results are presented that allow to validate the analytical results and to illustrate the achievable performance of the utility interface voltage regulation loop in steady state and transient conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310625","startPage":"6888","endPage":"6895","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07310625.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of oversampled current controllers for microgrid utility interface converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of oversampled current controllers for microgrid utility interface converters","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310625/","accessionNumber":"15570326","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310625/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of oversampled current controllers for microgrid utility interface converters","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"09950026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04906S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7310625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7310632,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyun Shao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyun","lastName":"Shao","id":"37085449977"},{"name":"Wei Hua","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hua","id":"37322612400"},{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085365036"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7310632","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Torque","Harmonic analysis","Stator windings","Coils","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","fault tolerance","finite element analysis","permanent magnet machines","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift","multiple winding sets","multiphase flux switching permanent magnet machines","winding configurations","finite element analysis","FEA","stator-pole combinations","rotor-pole combinations","symmetrical winding configuration","multiphase machines","symmetrical phase electromotive force","static torque","winding inductances","dual three-phase 24-stator-slot FSPM machine","22-rotor-pole FSPM machine","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flux-switching","permanent magnet","phase shift","multiple winding","multiphase","finite-element analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, winding configurations of multiphase flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machines with multiple winding sets are investigated by finite-element analysis (FEA).

However, little effort has been devoted at enhancing performance at micro-architecture level. This paper characterizes the performance of in-memory data analytics using Apache Spark framework. We use a single node NUMA machine and identify the bottlenecks hampering the scalability of workloads. We also quantify the inefficiencies at micro-architecture level for various data analysis workloads. Through empirical evaluation, we show that spark workloads do not scale linearly beyond twelve threads, due to work time inflation and thread level load imbalance. Further, at the micro-architecture level, we observe memory bound latency to be the major cause of work time inflation.","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud.2015.37","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307333/7310694/07310708.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud.2015.37","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7310694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Characterization of In-Memory Data Analytics on a Modern Cloud Server","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Characterization of In-Memory Data Analytics on a Modern Cloud Server","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310708/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15571022","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Characterization of In-Memory Data Analytics on a Modern Cloud Server","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"7183a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079219S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307333","isNumber":"7310694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307333","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7310694","articleId":"7310708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7310728,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Liu","affiliation":["Yunnan University, Kunming, P.R.

The characteristic of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), such as robustness and self adaptability, can just match the cloud environment. ACO is an algorithm that imitates the ants foraging, and it has a good application in the problems that want to find the optimal solution. The task scheduling in cloud computing is also the problem that want to find the optimal solution actually. In this paper, a self adaptive ant colony optimization (SAACO) is proposed. For the drawback of PACO we proposed before, such as the parameters' selection and the pheromone's update, in SAACO, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to make the parameters of ACO to be self adaptive. And we also improve the calculation and update of the pheromone. The results show that SAACO has a better performance than PACO both in makespan and load balance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAACO: A Self Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud.2015.53","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307333/7310694/07310731.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud.2015.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7310694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"SAACO: A Self Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310731/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAACO: A Self Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"7183a148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095465S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307333","isNumber":"7310694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307333","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7310694","articleId":"7310731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310735,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jin","affiliation":["Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, Wuhan, P.R.China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085713181"},{"name":"Chuan Tian","affiliation":["Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, Wuhan, P.R.China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085765238"},{"name":"Heng He","affiliation":["Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, Wuhan, P.R.China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"He","id":"37655313300"},{"name":"Fan Wang","affiliation":["Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, Wuhan, P.R.China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085760770"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7183-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7182-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7310735","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Encryption","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography","mobile computing","storage management","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight data access control scheme","mobile cloud computing","data storage","data processing","lightweight mobile device","centralized computing platform","MCC","sensitive data","trusted domain","untrusted party","data security","flexible access control","ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption algorithm","CP-ABE algorithm","data confidentiality","outsourced data","fine-grained data access control","overall system performance","computation overhead","encryption operation","decryption operation","data access control policy","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","access control","attribute-based encryption"]}],"abstract":"By moving data storage and processing from lightweight mobile devices to powerful and centralized computing platforms located in clouds, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) can greatly enhance the capability of mobile devices. However, when data owners outsource sensitive data to mobile cloud for sharing, the data is outside of their trusted domain and can potentially be granted to untrusted parties which include the service providers. Data security and flexible access control have become the most pressing demands for MCC. To address this issue, we design a secure and lightweight data access control scheme based on Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm, which can protect the confidentiality of outsourced data and provide fine-grained data access control in MCC. The scheme can obviously improve the overall system performance by greatly reducing the computation overheads in encryption and decryption operations, provide flexible and expressive data access control policy, and meanwhile enable data owners to securely outsource most of the computation overheads at mobile devices to cloud servers. The security and performance evaluation show that our scheme is secure, highly efficient and well suited for lightweight mobile devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure and Lightweight Data Access Control Scheme for Mobile Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud.2015.57","startPage":"172","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud.2015.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7310694","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307333/7310694/07310735.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Secure and Lightweight Data Access Control Scheme for Mobile Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310735/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570999","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure and Lightweight Data Access Control Scheme for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"7183a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075979S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307333","isNumber":"7310694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307333","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7310694","articleId":"7310735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310737,"authors":[{"name":"Junichi Kishigami","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Kishigami","id":"37085654298"},{"name":"Shigeru Fujimura","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Fujimura","id":"37085649274"},{"name":"Hiroki Watanabe","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37085654308"},{"name":"Atsushi Nakadaira","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Nakadaira","id":"37372593100"},{"name":"Akihiko Akutsu","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiko","lastName":"Akutsu","id":"37085652000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7183-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7182-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7310737","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":4402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Online banking","Metadata","Copyright protection","Authentication","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content management","digital rights management","message authentication","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain-based digital content distribution system","decentralized authentication mechanism","peer-to-peer authentication mechanism","right management mechanism","superdistribution concept"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","Content","Distribution","Rights","Superdistribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310737","abstract":"The blockchain-based digital content distribution system was developed.

Access Applications of Transform Domain Communication System Based on Phase Coding","abstract":"Transform Domain Communication System (TDCS) has been proposed as a new candidate applied in the cognitive radio (CR) environment since it can avoid existing users or jammers intelligently over a given bandwidth. The TDCS achieves noise-like property and orthogonality characteristic by generating a PR phase vector through a random phase coding processing. In this paper, a new implementation of TDCS is proposed for multiple access application by using spreading sequence with phase coding for the PR phase vector generation. The analysis and simulation of the selection of spreading sequence are studied and the related parameters are discussed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides good bit error rate in multiple access environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310744/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571043","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Access Applications of Transform Domain Communication System Based on Phase Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Access Applications of Transform Domain Communication System Based on Phase Coding","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"7183a217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037683S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307333","isNumber":"7310694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307333","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7310694","articleId":"7310744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310852,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7384408/7310852/leliu-2491307-small.gif","p":["Lei Liu was born in Henan, China, in 1990.

In this paper, a novel method for the translational motion compensation of ISAR imaging under low SNR is proposed. Translational motion is first modeled as a polynomial, and image quality evaluation metric (IQEM) such as image entropy, contrast, or peak value is utilized as the objective function to estimate the polynomial coefficient vector based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO). A PSO-based iteration process is presented to determine the polynomial order adaptively. Meanwhile, the computation burden of the proposed method is analyzed. In addition, a coarse estimation method of the polynomial coefficient vector is also discussed. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Translational Motion Compensation Method for ISAR Imaging Under Low SNR Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2491307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7384408/07310852.pdf","startPage":"5146","endPage":"5157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2491307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384408","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310852/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Translational Motion Compensation Method for ISAR Imaging Under Low SNR Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7310852/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15704933","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201283, 61471284, 612310107 and 61522114"},{"fundingName":"NSAF","grantNumber":"U1430123"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China","grantNumber":"201448"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0916"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Translational Motion Compensation Method for ISAR Imaging Under Low SNR Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhou-2491307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131534S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7384408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7384408","articleId":"7310852","onlineDate":"28 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7310856,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Zhao","affiliation":["Nano Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/7396981/7310856/zhao-2490204-small.gif","p":["Chun Zhao (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in measurement and control technology and instrument from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in analog and digital IC design from Imperial College London, London, U.K. in 2011.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics with the Nano Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K. His current research interests include microelectromechanical systems, miniature sensing devices, microresonators, and interface circuit for sensors design."]},"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085449016"},{"name":"Graham S.

If one resonator of the system is perturbed by an external stimulus, mode localization occurs, which can be detected by a change of modal amplitude ratio. The perturbation can be, for example, a change in stiffness of one resonator. A detailed theoretical investigation revealed that a mode aliasing effect, along with the thermal noise floor of the sensor and the associated electrical system ultimately limit the dynamic range of the sensor. The nonlinearity of the 3DoF sensor was also analyzed theoretically. The 3DoF resonator device was fabricated using a silicon on insulator process. Measurement results from a prototype device agreed well with the predictions of the analytical model. A significant, namely 49 times, improvement in sensitivity to stiffness change was evident from the fabricated 3DoF resonator sensor compared with the existing state-of-the-art 2DoF resonator sensors, while the typical nonlinearity was smaller than \u00b12% for a wide span of stiffness change. In addition, measurements indicate that a dynamic range of at least 39.1 dB is achievable, which could be further extended by decreasing the noise of the device and the interface electronics.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/84/7396981/07310856.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"51","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2490204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2490204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three Degree-of-Freedom Weakly Coupled Resonator Sensor With Enhanced Stiffness Sensitivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Three Degree-of-Freedom Weakly Coupled Resonator Sensor With Enhanced Stiffness Sensitivity","htmlLink":"/document/7310856/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15755328","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three Degree-of-Freedom Weakly Coupled Resonator Sensor With Enhanced Stiffness Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"jmems-zhao-2490204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080747S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"7396981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7396981","articleId":"7310856","onlineDate":"28 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310862,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Shui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Panyu District, GuangZhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7348621/7310862/zhang-2489659-small.gif","p":["Mu-Shui Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He has been a Faculty Member with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, since 2009, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Electromagnetic simulated results show that our method yields accurate delay with error smaller than 10%, while traditional delay estimation could introduce error larger than 130%.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7348621/07310862.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Delay Extraction of Serpentine Lines for Next-Generation High-Density DRAMs","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2489659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7348621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2489659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Delay Extraction of Serpentine Lines for Next-Generation High-Density DRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677396","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7310862/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015A030312010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Delay Extraction of Serpentine Lines for Next-Generation High-Density DRAMs","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-zhang-2489659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069265S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7348621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7348621","articleId":"7310862","onlineDate":"28 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7310864,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7310864/fzhan-2488681-small.gif","p":["\n\nFan Zhang received the B.S. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing \nfrom Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the State Key \nLaboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing.","His research interests include high-resolution image and hyperspectral image classification, machine learning, and \ncomputation vision in remote sensing applications."]},"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085568845"},{"name":"Bo Du","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7310864/du-2488681-small.gif","p":["\n\nBo Du (M'10\u2013SM'15) received the B.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree \nin photogrammetry and remote sensing from the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, \nand Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer, Wuhan University.

How to automatically recognize and analyze scenes from these satellite images effectively and efficiently has become a big challenge in the remote sensing field. Recently, a lot of work in scene classification has been proposed, focusing on deep neural networks, which learn hierarchical internal feature representations from image data sets and produce state-of-the-art performance. However, most methods, including the traditional shallow methods and deep neural networks, only concentrate on training a single model. Meanwhile, neural network ensembles have proved to be a powerful and practical tool for a number of different predictive tasks. Can we find a way to combine different deep neural networks effectively and efficiently for scene classification? In this paper, we propose a gradient boosting random convolutional network (GBRCN) framework for scene classification, which can effectively combine many deep neural networks. As far as we know, this is the first time that a deep ensemble framework has been proposed for scene classification. Moreover, in the experiments, the proposed method was applied to two challenging high-resolution data sets: 1) the UC Merced data set containing 21 different aerial scene categories with a submeter resolution and 2) a Sydney data set containing eight land-use categories with a 1.0-m spatial resolution. The proposed GBRCN framework outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with the UC Merced data set, including the traditional single convolutional network approach. For the Sydney data set, the proposed method again obtained the best accuracy, demonstrating that the proposed framework can provide more accurate classification results than the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7419294/07310864.pdf","startPage":"1793","endPage":"1802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scene Classification via a Gradient Boosting Random Convolutional Network Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Scene Classification via a Gradient Boosting Random Convolutional Network Framework","volume":"54","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7310864/","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823046","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310864/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2011CB707105 and 2012CB719905"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471274 and 41431175"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2014CFB193"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene Classification via a Gradient Boosting Random Convolutional Network Framework","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2488681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095427S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7419294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"7419294","articleId":"7310864","onlineDate":"28 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7310868,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Afshari","affiliation":["Smart Lighting Engineering Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/7488303/7310868/afsha-2487880-small.gif","p":["Sina Afshari (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, NY, USA, in 2010 and 2015, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He joined the Smart Lighting Engineering Research Center, RPI, in 2015, as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate.

In these systems, each light fixture has a spectrally tunable light source and a multichannel color sensor, and no communication is required between fixtures. Further, the light transport in the illuminated space is diagonally dominant, i.e., the light sensed by each sensor is primarily from the source in the same fixture. The controller design problems are formulated and solved for two cases of decentralized setpoint tracking and decentralized quadratic optimal control (with tracking error and energy penalty). For the decentralized setpoint tracking problem, a mechanism is proposed to automatically determine the feedback gains using individual sensor measurements in a plug-and-play fashion without the knowledge of the light transport model of the illuminated space. For the decentralized quadratic optimal control, the design problem is approximated with a series of local optimization problems, which are solved in a decentralized manner using individual sensor measurements. A suboptimality bound for the solution of the approximated problem compared with the global optimum is obtained. The performance of the suggested controllers in terms of achievement of a desired setpoint and daylight harvesting for energy saving is validated and evaluated based on typical lighting parameters in a room-scale experimental testbed with light-emitting diode fixtures and color sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2487880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2487880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7488303","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In this paper, we report the design of a 200-channel dual-mode acquisition IC with highly efficient usage of power and area. Under the constraints of target noise and fast settling, the current channel design saves power by including a novel current buffer biased in discrete time (DT) before the TIA (transimpedance amplifier).

Specifically, we design private objective functions for DSA users with multiple channel access and adaptive power allocation capabilities. We also propose simple two-phase heuristics for allocating spectrum and power resources among users. The proposed heuristics split the spectrum and power allocation problem into two subproblems, and solve each of them separately. The spectrum allocation problem is solved, during the first phase using learning. Two procedures to learn the channel selection are proposed and compared in terms of optimality, scalability, and robustness. The power allocation, on the other hand, is formulated as a real optimization problem and solved, during the second phase, by traditional optimization solvers. Simulation results show that energy and cross-layer awareness and multiple channel access capability improve the performance of the system in terms of the per-user average rewards received from accessing the dynamic spectrum access system. In addition, the two proposed methods for channel selection via learning represent a tradeoff between optimality, scalability, and robustness.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2495137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07310876.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Learning-Based Cross-Layer Technique for Energy-Efficient Multicarrier Dynamic Spectrum Access With Adaptive Power Allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7310876/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Learning-Based Cross-Layer Technique for Energy-Efficient Multicarrier Dynamic Spectrum Access With Adaptive Power Allocation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837515","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-319-2-121"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund, Doha, Qatar (a member of Qatar Foundation)."},{"fundingName":"International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM Workshops)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Learning-Based Cross-Layer Technique for Energy-Efficient Multicarrier Dynamic Spectrum Access With Adaptive Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"twc-guizani-2495137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097744S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7310876","onlineDate":"28 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7310878,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Jinjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7310878/hchen-2484378-small.gif","p":["Hao Chen received the B.Eng. degree in automatic control from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in control systems with distinction from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in cybernetics from the School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, U.K., in 2014, sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory from the British Government.","From 2014 to 2015, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, and Syncrude Canada Ltd., Fort McMurray, AB, Canada.

Based on an RBF network with individually tunable nodes and a fixed small model size, the weight vector is adjusted using the multi-innovation recursive least square algorithm on-line. When the residual error of the RBF network becomes large despite of the weight adaptation, an insignificant node with little contribution to the overall system is replaced by a new node. Structural parameters of the new node are optimized by proposed fast algorithms in order to significantly improve the modeling performance. The proposed scheme describes a novel, flexible, and fast way for on-line system identification problems.

However, unlike Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs), innovative designs and lack of various circuit techniques still remain unknown in THz gap. In this paper, a multi-band THz amplifier is presented in 40 nm CMOS technology with adaptive band selection technique. The smart amplifier is able to adjust the band of operation with respect to input signal power and frequency. In addition, the circuit performance will be adjusted to achieve maximum power gain. In order to achieve multi-band external neutralization, self-healing technique is vastly utilized by means of tunable transmission lines (TTLs). The proposed smart system contains tunable transmission lines, a 5-stage amplifier core, two Successive Approximation Register-based analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADCs), a digital control core and two on-chip power sensing blocks.

From this formulation, several important consequences of the method are derived and discussed. Some counterintuitive properties of Convex Hull Pricing are highlighted and demonstrated with simple examples.

To exploit this opportunity, there is a need for design abstractions and synthesis tools that can systematically incorporate approximation in hardware design. The authors define Axilog, a set of language extensions for Verilog that provides the necessary syntax and semantics for approximate hardware design and reuse. Axilog lets designers safely relax the accuracy requirements in the design while keeping the critical parts strictly precise. Axilog is coupled with a Safety Inference Analysis that automatically infers the safe-to-approximate gates and connections from the annotations. The analysis provides formal guarantees that the safe-to-approximate parts of the design strictly adhere to the designer's intentions. The authors devise two synthesis flows that leverage Axilog's framework for safe approximation; one by relaxing the timing requirements and the other through gate resizing. They evaluate Axilog using a diverse set of benchmarks that gain 1.54\u00d7 average energy savings and 1.82\u00d7 average area reduction with 10 percent output quality loss. The results show that the intuitive nature of the language extensions coupled with the automated analysis enables safe approximation of designs even with thousands of lines of code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557967","htmlLink":"/document/7310928/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Axilog: Abstractions for Approximate Hardware Design and Reuse","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Axilog: Abstractions for Approximate Hardware Design and Reuse","sourcePdf":"mmi2015050016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069511S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"7310924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7310924","articleId":"7310928","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310929,"authors":[{"name":"Dilan Manatunga","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Dilan Manatunga is a PhD student in the School of Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Computer architects have exploited the extra transistors by incorporating several computing cores within a single processor. Heterogeneous processing in particular has become a useful technique for dealing with ever-present power and memory restrictions. Yet, the scope and diversity of current heterogeneous designs remain bounded by the level of functional abstraction specified by conventional instruction-set architectures (ISAs). In this article, the authors demonstrate how the functional abstraction level determines the capability and variety of a processor's functional units and accelerators, thereby restricting its degree of heterogeneity. Combining current heterogeneous techniques with software abstraction concepts, the authors propose a new functional ISA (F-ISA), which raises the functional abstraction level of machine instructions. Using this model to complement existing architectures makes available a wider scope and diversity of functional units and accelerators in order to exploit the ever-increasing transistor densities. Greater heterogeneity can offer advances in terms of object data mapping and execution, resulting in potentially substantial latency, memory footprint, and power/performance gains.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel7/40/7310924/07310930.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reimagining Heterogeneous Computing: A Functional Instruction-Set Architecture Computing Model","doi":"10.1109/MM.2015.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7310924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2015.109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7310930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Reimagining Heterogeneous Computing: A Functional Instruction-Set Architecture Computing Model","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7310930/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reimagining Heterogeneous Computing: A Functional Instruction-Set Architecture Computing Model","sourcePdf":"mmi2015050006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076771S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"7310924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","xplore-issue":"7310924","articleId":"7310930","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7310933,"authors":[{"name":"Sergi Abadal","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya"],"bio":{"p":["Sergi Abadal is a PhD student at the NaNo-Networking Center in Catalonia, Spain, at the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya.

A mineral oil was also tested and used as the benchmark. In total, liquids with four particle contamination levels, i.e. low, normal, marginal and high; two moisture levels, i.e. dry and wet conditions, and three types of electrodes, i.e. plane-plane, rod-rod, and VDE electrodes were investigated. Results showed that the presence of cellulose particles reduces the 50% breakdown voltages of the ester liquids and the mineral oil in uniform fields, which is further enhanced when the particle is combined with the moisture. The particle effect on breakdown voltages also becomes more prominent when the effective stressed area/volume of the electrode configurations is increased. Nevertheless, at the same conditions, 50% lightning impulse breakdown voltages of the ester liquids are always comparable to that of the mineral oil. Linking with previously published results under AC voltages, it is summarised that the particle effect on liquid breakdown is associated with the effective stressed area, the duration of electric stress and the viscosity of the liquid itself. In addition, the streamer imaging tests revealed that the detrimental effect of cellulose particles on breakdowns in liquids is due to the promotion on streamer initiations rather than on streamer propagations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7309523/07311030.pdf","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.005097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.005097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of cellulose particles on impulse breakdown in ester transformer liquids in uniform electric fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Liquids","Electric breakdown","Contamination","Minerals","Electrodes","Lightning","Oil insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric breakdown","lightning protection","power transformer insulation","surface contamination","transformer oil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellulose particle effect","synthetic ester","natural ester","mineral oil","particle contamination level","VDE electrode","plane-plane electrode","rod-rod electrode","moisture","lightning impulse breakdown voltage","liquid breakdown","electric stress","liquid viscosity","streamer imaging test","detrimental effect","ester transformer liquids","uniform electric field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellulose particle","moisture","lightning impulse","breakdown voltage","transformer","mineral oil","ester liquids"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Effect of cellulose particles on impulse breakdown in ester transformer liquids in uniform electric fields","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7311030/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2015","accessionNumber":"15587780","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of cellulose particles on impulse breakdown in ester transformer liquids in uniform electric fields","sourcePdf":"p2554-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109115S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7309523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7309523","articleId":"7311030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7311034,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Cavallini","affiliation":["DEI-LIT, University of Bologna Viale Risorgimento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7309523/7311034/7311034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Cavallini (M'95) was born on 21 December 1963.

Samples cut from a real high voltage cable equipped with an embedded electrode system and composed of a needle separated by 2 mm from counter electrode were used. The temperature was varied between 50 and 90 \u00b0C and the range of voltage changed between 9 and 18 kV. The electrical treeing process was followed by means of microscopic observation from the moment of initiation until the leading branches connected the counter electrode and partial discharge (PD) activity was monitored simultaneously. The shape and fractal dimension of the resulting trees were analyzed. It was found that temperature and voltage level had pronounced effect on the process of electrical tree formation. At lower voltages different type of trees could be formed, whereas at higher voltages branch trees dominated. Increase of test temperature reduced the time for tree initiation, whereas the tree growth time was less affected, except for the lowest voltage level at which the slowest tree development was observed at the highest test temperature. It is postulated that the impeding effect of elevated temperature on tree growth is due to a change of tree channel sidewall conductivity, whereas the observed reduction of tree initiation time with the increase of temperature and voltage level is attributed to lowering of the threshold energy for damage at higher temperature as well as increasing of the injection current at higher voltage level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2015.004784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7309523/07311063.pdf","startPage":"2841","endPage":"2851","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2015.004784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical treeing behavior at high temperature in XLPE cable insulation samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","displayDocTitle":"Electrical treeing behavior at high temperature in XLPE cable insulation samples","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7311063/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2015","accessionNumber":"15587799","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical treeing behavior at high temperature in XLPE cable insulation samples","sourcePdf":"p2841-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10153S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7309523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7309523","articleId":"7311063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7311124,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Ibrahim","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Pekan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37605872100"},{"name":"Zuwairie Ibrahim","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Pekan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zuwairie","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37303868100"},{"name":"Hamzah Ahmad","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Pekan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hamzah","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37532129900"},{"name":"Zulkifli Md.

It is shown that in some cases the orthogonal chaotic CDM transmission system employing set of binary sequences, which is tailored to the particular communication channel, outperforms OFDM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311135/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15571311","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311135/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Chaos Code Division Multiplexing Communication System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos Code Division Multiplexing Communication System","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"7016a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04471S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310773","isNumber":"7311009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310773","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7311009","articleId":"7311135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7311163,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Pajkanovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Pajkanovic","id":"38493082700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7016-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7015-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311163","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"abstract":"In this paper an operational amplifier of general purpose is presented.

Traditionally, time performance is one of the key concerns in running parallel applications. However, the advent of datacenters increases the availability of systems with diverse performance-to-power ratios. These heterogeneous systems consist of hardware including high-performance processors, low-power servers, GPU accelerators, and storage and network resources with different performance. As a consequence, the very large system configuration space introduces new opportunities and complexity for users to run parallel applications efficiently. This keynote discusses a new model-driven approach to determine time-energy efficient configurations for executing applications on heterogeneous systems. By modeling the workload service demands on cores, memory and I/O devices of a node, we obtain the energy-efficient mix of nodes that services a job while maintaining a service time deadline. We show that there is a range of \u201csweet spots\u201d or Pareto-optimal configurations for executing an application within an energy budget and a given execution time deadline. This keynote is divided into three main parts. First, we review the challenges that users and datacenter providers faced in achieving time and energy efficient parallel application execution. Secondly, we introduce our model-driven approach and the formulation of the mix-and-match execution time model. As an example, we discuss the application of our approach on a heterogeneous system consisting of AMD brawny nodes and ARM wimpy nodes with typical data center workloads including web-hosting, multimedia streaming, financial analysis, real-time speech recognition and TLS/SSL key encryption. In addition, we investigated a number of research questions including is heterogeneity better than homogeneity, are larger mixes of heterogeneous nodes better, among others. Lastly, we highlight new opportunities in modeling time-energy performance such as in cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/ISMS.2015.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMS.2015.58","startPage":"3","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310774/7311187/07311199.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 6th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model-driven approach for time-energy performance of parallel applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A model-driven approach for time-energy performance of parallel applications","conferenceDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311199/","accessionNumber":"15571349","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311199/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-driven approach for time-energy performance of parallel applications","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"8258a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034051S","chronDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310774","isNumber":"7311187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310774","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7311187","articleId":"7311199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311209,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Reungsinkonkarn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information System, Assumption University"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Reungsinkonkarn","id":"37085693967"},{"name":"Paskorn Apirukvorapinit","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Paskorn","lastName":"Apirukvorapinit","id":"37085696891"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8258-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8257-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0662"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0670"}],"articleNumber":"7311209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer bugs","Software","Complexity theory","Particle swarm optimization","Computational modeling","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","program debugging","search problems","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","search space reduction","bug detection tool","software engineering development","software bug detection","fitness function","hierarchical similarity measurement model","HSM","program behavior","PSO","SSR","input search space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bug Detection","Fitness Function","Hierarchical Similarity Measurement Model (HSM)","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311209","abstract":"A bug detection tool is an important tool in software engineering development. Many research papers have proposed techniques for detecting software bug, but there are certain semantic bugs that are not easy to detect. In our views, a bug can occur from incorrect logics that when a program is executed with a particular input, the program will behave in unexpected ways. In this paper, we propose a method and tool for software bugs detection by finding such input that causes an unexpected output guided by the fitness function. The method uses a Hierarchical Similarity Measurement Model (HSM) to help create the fitness function to examine a program behavior. Its tool uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Search Space Reduction (SSR) to manipulate input by contracting and eliminating unfavorable areas of input search space. The programs under experiment were selected from four different domains such as financial, decision support system, algorithms and machine learning. The experimental result shows a significant percentage of success rate up to 93% in bug detection, compared to an estimated success rate of 28% without SSR.","doi":"10.1109/ISMS.2015.20","pdfPath":"/iel7/7310774/7311187/07311209.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","publicationTitle":"2015 6th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMS.2015.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bug Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization with Search Space Reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bug Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization with Search Space Reduction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571341","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7311209/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bug Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization with Search Space Reduction","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"8258a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049019S","chronDate":"9-12 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7310774","isNumber":"7311187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7310774","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7311187","articleId":"7311209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7311233,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Kashif Janjua","affiliation":["CAS-EN at NUST, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul Kashif","lastName":"Janjua","id":"37085720349"},{"name":"Sufyan Naeem Mughal","affiliation":["CAS-EN at NUST, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sufyan Naeem","lastName":"Mughal","id":"37085731262"},{"name":"Akif Zia Khan","affiliation":["CAS-EN at NUST, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Akif Zia","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086024342"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8258-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8257-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0662"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0670"}],"articleNumber":"7311233","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Transformer cores","Optimization","Copper","Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","transformer cores","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformer core size optimization","genetic algorithm","exponential escalation","power distribution system","transformer winding","optimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transformer core","transformer size optimization","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311233","abstract":"Exponential escalation in the energy requirements and depletion of mineral resources has forced scientists to recycle and find the most optimized way of using the mineral resources left on earth.

We observe that the target and interference spectra are inherently sparse in the spatio-temporal domain, and hence we exploit that sparsity to develop an efficient STAP technique. In addition, the use of an OFDM signal increases the frequency diversity of our system, as different scattering centers of a target resonate at different frequencies, and thus improves the target detectability. First, we formulate a realistic sparse-measurement model for an OFDM radar considering both the clutter and jammer as the interfering sources. Then, we show that the optimal STAP-filter weight-vector is equal to the generalized eigenvector corresponding to the minimum generalized eigenvalue of the interference and target covariance matrices. To estimate the target and interference covariance matrices, we apply a residual sparse-recovery technique that enables us to incorporate the partially known support of the sparse vector. Our numerical results demonstrate that the sparsity-based STAP algorithm, with considerably lesser number of secondary data, produces an equivalent performance as the other existing STAP techniques.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDD.2012.7311257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311172","startPage":"160","endPage":"165","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299534/7311172/07311257.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-based space-time adaptive processing using OFDM radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/7311257/","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-based space-time adaptive processing using OFDM radar","conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"15570409","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-based space-time adaptive processing using OFDM radar","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"57041SparsityBasedSTAPUsingOFDMRadar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083797S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311258,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Chen","affiliation":["ECE Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37073590800"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Muralidhar Rangaswamy","affiliation":["AFRL/RYAP, Building 620, 2241 Avionics Circle WPAFB, OH, 45433-7132, USA"],"firstName":"Muralidhar","lastName":"Rangaswamy","id":"37285007800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0598-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311258","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311258","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a group of reduced-rank (RR) space-time adaptive processing (STAP) detectors based on the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. The CG algorithm can be used for efficient calculation of the weight vector of several well-known STAP detectors. As an iterative algorithm, it produces a series of approximations to the fully adaptive solution, each of which can be used to filter the test signal and form a test statistic. This effectively leads to a family of RR adaptive detectors, referred to as the CG-RR detectors, which are indexed by k the number of iterations incurred. Performance of the proposed CG-RR detectors are examined in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The conventional RR methods for STAP such as the data-independent DFT or DCT based rank reduction, the adaptive eigencanceler and cross-spectral metric (CSM) algorithm are also considered here. Simulation results show that the computationally efficient CG-RR detector often reaches the peak output SINR with a lower rank compared with the eigencanceler and CSM based detectors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Covariance matrices","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","gradient methods","interference (signal)","iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient algorithm","reduced rank adaptive detection","RR","space-time adaptive processing","STAP detectors","CG algorithm","weight vector","iterative algorithm","test statistic","output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","cross spectral metric","CSM algorithm","adaptive eigencanceler"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDD.2012.7311258","startPage":"027","endPage":"031","publicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299534/7311172/07311258.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WDD.2012.7311258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the conjugate gradient algorithm for reduced-rank adaptive detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using the conjugate gradient algorithm for reduced-rank adaptive detection","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15570355","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7311258/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the conjugate gradient algorithm for reduced-rank adaptive detection","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"67008UsingtheConjugateGradientAlgorithm.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103088S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7311259,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Jameson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Jameson","id":"37706484900"},{"name":"Y.

Covariance matrix based method has been widely used in spectrum sensing. As is well-known that the covariance matrix of white noise is proportional to the identity matrix which is sparse. On the other hand, the covariance matrix of signal is usually low-rank. Robust principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed recently to recover the low-rank matrix which is corrupted by a sparse matrix with arbitrarily large magnitude non-zero entries. In this paper, robust PCA for spectrum sensing is proposed based on the sample covariance matrix. The received signal will be divided into two segments. Robust PCA will be applied to extract the low-rank matrices from the sample covariance matrices of both segments. The primary user's signal is detected if the discrepancy between the recovered low-rank matrices is smaller than a predefined threshold. The simulations are done both on the simulated and captured DTV signal. Also, the simulations that robust PCA is taken as a de-noising process for sample covariance matrix are also implemented in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15570363","htmlLink":"/document/7311263/","conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio with robust principal component analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio with robust principal component analysis","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"117074SpectrumSensinginCognitiveRadio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045135S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7311266,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Ozdemir","affiliation":["ANDRO Computational Solutions LLC, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Ozdemir","id":"37285612700"},{"name":"Engin Masazade","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Engin","lastName":"Masazade","id":"37085624758"},{"name":"Chilukuri K.

With recent advances in cognitive radio, it is highly desired to combine the security advantages of chaos communication with the flexibility of cognitive radio to create a chaos based cognitive radio communication system that improves the spectrum usage while maintaining high security features. In this paper, we propose a multi-user non-continuous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) based chaotic communication system employing orthogonal polyphase spreading codes. Specifically, a polyphase spreading code called carrier interferometry code is layered onto the frequency domain chaotic waveform to create multi-user support. The proposed system not only maintains the capability of operating over multiple non-contiguous spectrum holes, but also offers security features by chaos sequence modulation. For comparison purposes, we develop two benchmark schemes using both NC-OFDM and chaos modulation. Simulation results show significant performance advantage of the proposed scheme than the benchmark schemes. Finally, we point out that the proposed scheme allows flexible access control for different users and groups, in broadcast, multicast and unicast services.","doi":"10.1109/WDD.2012.7311271","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299534/7311172/07311271.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDD.2012.7311271","publicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser chaos communication through polyphase spreading for overlay cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser chaos communication through polyphase spreading for overlay cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311271/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311271/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"15570389","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser chaos communication through polyphase spreading for overlay cognitive radio","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"197047MultiuserChaosCommunicationThrough.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050211S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7311276,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Vouras","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Vouras","id":"37294569400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0598-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311276","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Interference","Radar antennas","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO radar","pulse compression","radar interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic construction","MIMO radar waveforms","spatial multiple input multiple output","MIMO radar system","pulse compression sequences","interference","waveform design algorithm","matrix representations","finite abelian groups"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a method for constructing waveforms such that the individual radars in a spatial Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar system can simultaneously transmit pulse compression sequences yet avoid interference with each other.

Carrier Interferometry code for MC-CDMA (CI/MC-CDMA) provides better BER performance, less peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and higher design flexibility than conventional MC-CDMA systems employing Hadarmard-Walsh spreading code. However, like all the multi-carrier transmission technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the inter-carrier interference (ICI) produced by the frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver local oscillators or by Doppler frequency shift due to high mobility causes significant bit error rate (BER) performance degradation in CI/MC-CDMA system. In this paper, we apply the ICI self-cancellation scheme previously proposed for OFDM system to orthogonal CI/MC-CDMA system to reduce ICI effect and improve BER performance. Unlike the traditional ICI self-cancellation scheme for OFDM which reduces the ICI at the price of lowing the transmission rate and reducing the bandwidth efficiency, we introduce a second set of orthogonal CI codes to maintain the throughput. Simulations of different leveled modulations over AWGN channel and multi-path fading channel confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed self-embedded ICI cancellation scheme for CI/MC-CDMA system where significant BER performance gain has been observed when ICI is present.","doi":"10.1109/WDD.2012.7311284","publicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299534/7311172/07311284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDD.2012.7311284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311172","startPage":"037","endPage":"042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-carrier interference self-cancellation for CI/MC-CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inter-carrier interference self-cancellation for CI/MC-CDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311284/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"15570379","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7311284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-carrier interference self-cancellation for CI/MC-CDMA system","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"327015InterCarrierInterferenceSelfCancellatio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091902S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311292,"authors":[{"name":"David L.

A new non-homogeneous clutter model, where the clutter resides in a low-rank subspace with different subspace coefficients for different transmit-receive pairs, is introduced. The subspace clutter model is effective in capturing the non-homogeneity of the clutter and, in particular, the power variations across different aspect angles and resolution cells. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which performs local matched subspace detection, noncoherent combining using local decision variables of all transmit-receive pairs and target velocity matching, is proposed. The GLRT is shown to be a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector. Computer simulations are provided to verify our statistical analysis of the GLRT, and a comparison with existing detectors is conducted to evaluate the impact of model mismatch on detection performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299534/7311172/07311298.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2012 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD)","doi":"10.1109/WDD.2012.7311298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDD.2012.7311298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving target detection using distributed MIMO radar in non-homogeneous clutter: A subspace approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Detectors","MIMO radar","Maximum likelihood estimation","Radar antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar clutter","radar detection","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving target detection","distributed MIMO radar","nonhomogeneous clutter model","multistatic transmit-receive configuration","distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar","MTD","generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT","local matched subspace detection","local decision variables","transmit-receive pairs","target velocity matching","constant false alarm rate detector","CFAR detector","statistical analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Moving target detection using distributed MIMO radar in non-homogeneous clutter: A subspace approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311298/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"15570407","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving target detection using distributed MIMO radar in non-homogeneous clutter: A subspace approach","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"467054MovingTargetDetectionUsingDistributed.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0586S","chronDate":"22-27 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"7299534","isNumber":"7311172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299534","xplore-issue":"7311172","articleId":"7311298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311299,"authors":[{"name":"Augusto Aubry","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, DIBET, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Aubry","id":"37393675700"},{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, DIBET, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"},{"name":"Marco Piezzo","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, DIBET, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Piezzo","id":"37393102800"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["SELEX Sistemi-Integrati, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37274494900"},{"name":"Michael Wicks","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wicks","id":"37273856900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0598-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311299","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of knowledge-aided transmit signal and receive filter design for a point-like target embedded in a high reverberating signal-dependent environment.

These classes will cover first trajectory-based operations (SESAR Step2/Class B), and later performance based operations (SESAR Step3/Class A), while maintaining compatibility with existing satellite communications (SatCom) systems for current time-based ATM operations in oceanic areas (SESAR Step1/Class C). The objective of this paper is to introduce a SatCom (Class A) performance solution defined within ESA Iris ANTARES (AeroNauTicAl REsources Satellite based) project [2]-[3]-[4]. The solution will be able to accomplish the most demanding SESAR services (i.e. Full 4D) in the Future Communications Infrastructure (FCI) for the long term. This SatCom system is considered a Communication Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) enabler, as expressed in the SESAR Master Plan document [5], focused mainly in providing support to communications services. For this purpose, in the frame of the ANTARES project, a new SatCom Communications Protocol [2][4] was designed that makes use of innovative techniques to counteract the aeronautical mobile channel effects. In addition, in the ANTARES project a Validation Test Bed (VTB) has been developed, emulating real-time Full 4D operational scenarios, with the main goal of verifying that the Communications Protocol performances meet Class A. Finally, the Communication Protocol performance obtained will be compared to the Satcom Class A performance expectations, showing that the designed Communications Standard performance results (as TD95 and continuity) achieve the future ATM communications needs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of a new satellite communications protocol for long-term ATM needs","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2015.7311365","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301991/7311321/07311365.pdf","startPage":"2B5-1","endPage":"2B5-10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2015.7311365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Validation of a new satellite communications protocol for long-term ATM needs","conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311365/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570826","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of a new satellite communications protocol for long-term ATM needs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"2b5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069355S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301991","isNumber":"7311321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301991","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7311321","articleId":"7311365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311366,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Rieth","affiliation":["Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Rieth","id":"37085386300"},{"name":"Christoph Heller","affiliation":["Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Heller","id":"37604283400"},{"name":"Detlev Blaschke","affiliation":["Airbus Defence and Space, Manching, Germany"],"firstName":"Detlev","lastName":"Blaschke","id":"37085394359"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Aachan, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8940-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8939-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7311366","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Aircraft","Atmospheric modeling","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne MIMO communication","multiple input multiple output antenna","channel capacity enhancements","robustness improvements","data links","line of sight flight scenarios","air-to-ground flight scenarios","ground reflected path","transmit-receive antenna pair","channel matrix"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows the results of practicability considerations concerning airborne Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna configurations.

Firstly, the influence of impulsive interference to channel estimation is analyzed. According to theoretical results, impulsive interference could be connected with impulsive taps in channel impulse response (CIR). Then, based on impulsive taps in CIR, the influence of impulsive interference in channel estimation could be located and further mitigated. To this end, a threshold is given to detect and mitigate impulsive taps in CIR. Furthermore, with the help of impulsive taps detection, not only the channel estimation could be improved, but also the impulsive interference could also be pulse blanked (PB) more accurately.

These challenges range from increased traffic flow, to reducing environmental impact, to routing efficiency, all while maintaining high safety. The FAA has recently been involved in a number of large scale Metroplex redesigns across the country to enable controllers and pilots to implement more efficient Performance-based Navigation (PBN) procedures on a regional basis. The Houston Metroplex project is one of the first to implement such a large scale change in the NAS, and it significantly changed the traffic flows into the Houston Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) airspace for the two major airports: Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and Houston's William P. Hobby International Airport (HOU).

Kennedy International airports. The same method is applied to radar track surveillance data to identify anomalies in the airspace before and after the Metroplex procedure change at Houston. The study covers flights traversing through Houston TRACON (I90) and landing at IAH and HOU over a period of 2 years before and after the significant procedure change. Anomalies identified before and after the procedure change were characterized by their safety risk and operational efficiency to determine whether the types of anomalies that were discovered from before continued to exist or if they were eliminated after the procedure change or if new types of anomalies began to appear.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2015.7311387","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301991/7311321/07311387.pdf","startPage":"2G4-1","endPage":"2G4-15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2015.7311387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of metroplex airspace and procedures using machine learning to discover flight track anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311387/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of metroplex airspace and procedures using machine learning to discover flight track anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570735","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311387/","conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of metroplex airspace and procedures using machine learning to discover flight track anomalies","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"2g4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06266S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301991","isNumber":"7311321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301991","xplore-issue":"7311321","articleId":"7311387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7311415,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Aim\u00e9 Maxa","affiliation":["Univ de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","ENAC, TELECOM/Resco, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Aim\u00e9","lastName":"Maxa","id":"37085690602"},{"name":"Mohamed Slim Ben Mahmoud","affiliation":["ENAC, TELECOM/Resco, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed Slim","lastName":"Ben Mahmoud","id":"37596732000"},{"name":"Nicolas Larrieu","affiliation":["ENAC, TELECOM/Resco, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Larrieu","id":"37268180000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8940-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8939-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7311415","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":843},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks","Routing","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","autonomous aerial vehicles","routing protocols","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure routing protocol design","UAV ad hoc networks","UAANET","unmanned aerial vehicles","ground control station","node mobility degree","network connectivity patterns","delay-sensitive applications","network security","model driven development","secure communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311415","abstract":"UAV Ad hoc NETworks (UAANETs) can be defined as a new form of ad hoc networks in which nodes are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Ground Control Station (GCS). Compared to the usual Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET), this new network paradigm has some unique features and brings specific challenges such as node mobility degree, network connectivity patterns, delay-sensitive applications and network security. Indeed, from routing point of view, none of the several UAANET routing protocols proposed in the literature have been designed with security in mind. This lack of consideration can make the certification of UAANETs difficult to obtain. In this paper, we present our vision of such a challenge and the research that we are conducting. The aim is to propose an original secure routing protocol for UAANETs using a Model Driven Development (MDD) approach which will ease the certification of final UAV products. The first preliminary results concerning our secure-routing protocol design will be presented. This paper describes our ongoing research which will provide secure communications for UAV ad hoc networks at the end of the SUANET (Secure Uav Ad-hoc NETwork) project.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2015.7311415","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/AIAA 34th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301991/7311321/07311415.pdf","startPage":"4A5-1","endPage":"4A5-15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2015.7311415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure routing protocol design for UAV Ad hoc NETworks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure routing protocol design for UAV Ad hoc NETworks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15570799","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311415/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure routing protocol design for UAV Ad hoc NETworks","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"4a5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075107S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301991","isNumber":"7311321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301991","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7311321","articleId":"7311415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7311417,"authors":[{"name":"Sixiao Wei","affiliation":["Intelligent Fusion Technology, Germantown, MD"],"firstName":"Sixiao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085387263"},{"name":"Dan Shen","affiliation":["Intelligent Fusion Technology, Germantown, MD"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37291992800"},{"name":"Genshe Chen","affiliation":["Intelligent Fusion Technology, Germantown, MD"],"firstName":"Genshe","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291142300"},{"name":"Hanlin Zhang","affiliation":["Towson University, Towson, MD"],"firstName":"Hanlin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086156551"},{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Towson University, Towson, MD"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841200"},{"name":"Erik Blasch","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Blasch","id":"37295205900"},{"name":"Khanh Pham","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, NM"],"firstName":"Khanh","lastName":"Pham","id":"37339513200"},{"name":"Jose B.

An issue of developing and demonstrating innovative and effective situational awareness techniques for avionics has increased in importance in the last decade. In this paper, we first conducted a game theoretical based modeling and analysis to study the interaction between an adversary and a defender. We then introduced the implementation of game-theoretic analysis on an Avionics Sensor-based Defense System (ASDS), which consists of distributed passive and active network sensors. A trade-off between defense and attack strategy was studied via existing tools for game theory (Gambit). To further enhance the defense and mitigate attacks, we designed and implemented a multi-functional web display to integrate the game theocratic analysis. Our simulation validates that the game theoretical modeling and analysis can help the Avionics Sensor-based Defense System (ASDS) adapt detection and response strategies to efficiently and dynamically deal with various cyber threats.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7311417/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570725","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On effectiveness of game theoretic modeling and analysis against cyber threats for avionic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On effectiveness of game theoretic modeling and analysis against cyber threats for avionic systems","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"4b2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093753S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301991","isNumber":"7311321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301991","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7311321","articleId":"7311417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7311482,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko Jakovljevic","affiliation":["TTTech Computertechnik AG, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Jakovljevic","id":"37294855700"},{"name":"Astrit Ademaj","affiliation":["TTTech Computertechnik AG, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Astrit","lastName":"Ademaj","id":"37297508900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8940-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8939-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7311482","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Aircraft","Aerospace electronics","Aerospace control","Robustness","Software","Ethernet networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","aerospace computing","aircraft control","avionics","embedded systems","local area networks","time division multiplexing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ethernet networks","generic open architectures","cross-industry application","aerospace application","actuators","distributed hard RT functions","embedded resource virtualization","complex integrated systems","embedded platform design","time-driven communication","deterministic communication","time-division multiplexing","synchronous multiplexing","modular aircraft control architectures","avionics","RTCA DO-297","embedded platforms","distributed IMA"]}],"abstract":"Distributed IMA, as described in RTCA DO-297, has been used in different forms since 1980s in avionics and modular aircraft control architectures which deploy synchronous or time-division multiplexing for deterministic communication.

In complex integrated systems, Distributed IMA enables full virtualization of embedded resources to host distributed hard RT functions. Distributed IMA supports full separation of controlled objects (actuators), input/output devices and sensors from the computing modules in aerospace and other cross-industry applications.

Based on a three-dimensional approach in cylindrical coordinates a differential-algebraic state-space model with varying parameters (LPV) is proposed. Due to the chosen level of model abstraction as well as motor material data uncertainties significant estimation errors between the LPTN and experimental test bench measurements result. To improve the estimation accuracy particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is applied for strategic fitting of uncertain model parameters with respect to a maximum likelihood cost function. To avoid converging in suboptimal local minima, which is a typical problem of gradient-based standard optimisation methods, the meta-heuristic PSO is utilised for the resulting multi-variable, non-linear and constrained optimisation problem. For the identification process experimental training data is used which is statistically independent from the (cross-)validation profiles.

A potential solution to this problem is integration of large battery energy storage systems that would act as buffers for short-term grid dynamics. Since the batteries store energy in dc, a power electronic interface in the form of an inverter is inevitable for coupling with the existing ac grid. A promising converter for medium-to-high power levels at low voltage is the so-called T-type Neutral-Point-Clamped (TNPC) converter. Such a converter is operated with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in order to comply with the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) requirements in the grid codes. A generalized implementation of a variant of the well-known space-vector modulation featuring lower losses is proposed in this work. The highlight of this work is a set of relations to select a switching sequence that optimizes the switching loss and the output THD. The derived relations are based on the binary logic and symmetry of the possible states of the converter. The algorithm enables the dynamic adjustment of the clamping width and the position and hence, the switching sequences to accommodate the capacitive as well as inductive behavior of the converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7311719/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568987","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive switching-loss-optimized space-vector modulation for three-level neutral-point-clamped converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive switching-loss-optimized space-vector modulation for three-level neutral-point-clamped converters","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0712epe2015full23243802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069242S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7311719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7311740,"authors":[{"name":"Umamaheswara Vemulapati","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Corporate Research, Baden-Dattwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Umamaheswara","lastName":"Vemulapati","id":"37931243300"},{"name":"Munaf Rahimo","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Munaf","lastName":"Rahimo","id":"37266949100"},{"name":"Martin Arnold","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Arnold","id":"37573456100"},{"name":"Tobias Wikstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Wikstr\u00f6m","id":"37281572500"},{"name":"Jan Vobecky","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Vobecky","id":"37352791800"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Backlund","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Backlund","id":"37888445500"},{"name":"Thomas Stiasny","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Stiasny","id":"37941603300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1522-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1523-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311740","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Cathodes","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Performance evaluation","Market research","Anodes","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IGCT technology","high power electronics application","integrated gate commutated thyristor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IGCT","Power semiconductor device","High power discrete device","Bipolar device","Industrial application"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we review the progress made recently for further developing the Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor (IGCT) device concept for high power electronics applications.

The nonlinearity of light emitting diode (LED), which was used as optical front end, was also considered in the simulation. The simulation results show that BER is degraded by not only companding noise but also the noise caused by LED nonlinearity.

This causes relatively slow speed with high processor power consumption when the network traffics. To improve the performance of the network, hardware could undertake some operations. As hardware can detect PFC frame generation and scheduling of ETS, in this paper, we proposed a design to offload the operations of PFC and ETS onto FPGA. The design was functionally verified on Xilinx Virtex-6. An enhanced 10 Gb/s Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) controller was thus implemented. Moreover, this module can be applied not only in FCoE converged network, but also other lossless Ethernet.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311006/7311794/07311911.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers","doi":"10.1109/ICNISC.2015.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNISC.2015.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Enhanced 10Gb/s Ethernet MAC Controller for DCB Offloading on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Field programmable gate arrays","Standards","Protocols","Registers","Bandwidth","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","field programmable gate arrays","local area networks","scheduling","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced 10Gb/s Ethernet media access control controller","DCB offloading","lossless Ethernet","FCoE converged network","Xilinx Virtex-6","ETS scheduling","PFC frame generation","protocol stack software","data center bridging","FPGA","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DCB","PFC","ETS","FPGA","MAC","10 Gb/s Ethernet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Enhanced 10Gb/s Ethernet MAC Controller for DCB Offloading on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15728058","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Enhanced 10Gb/s Ethernet MAC Controller for DCB Offloading on FPGA","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"1843a385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050585S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311006","isNumber":"7311794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311006","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7311794","articleId":"7311911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7311945,"authors":[{"name":"Sitong Lv","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Aviation University of Air Force, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Sitong","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085738413"},{"name":"Zhihong Qian","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Qian","id":"37402896000"},{"name":"Ying Dong","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085728390"},{"name":"Qian Li","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Li","id":"37085720621"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1843-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1842-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7311945","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"Correlation difference timing scheme (CDTS) algorithm based on cross-correlation difference and correlation summation peak protection is proposed to address the critical issue of symbol timing synchronization for MBOFDM based UWB systems. The two step synchronization scheme attempts to locate the start sample of the frame sequence (FS) by firstly calculating the cross correlation difference of received symbols and predefined preamble and then finding summation of correlation peak within the timing index chosen in the first step. Therefore, the timing index could be guaranteed to be unique. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by mean square error (MSE). CDTS algorithm could implement timing synchronization for MB-/OFDM based UWB systems and make the uniqueness of timing index for sure. The MSE of CDTS is evidently lower than conversional method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311006/7311794/07311945.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"539","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers","doi":"10.1109/ICNISC.2015.150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNISC.2015.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Timing Synchronization Scheme for MB-OFDM Based UWB Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Synchronization","Indexes","OFDM","Ultra wideband technology","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSE","mean square error","timing index","frame sequence","symbol timing synchronization","correlation summation peak protection","cross-correlation difference","CDTS algorithm","correlation difference timing scheme","UWB systems","Multra wideband communication","MB-OFD","timing synchronization scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["timing synchronization","MB-OFDM","UWB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7311945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Timing Synchronization Scheme for MB-OFDM Based UWB Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7311945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15728074","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Timing Synchronization Scheme for MB-OFDM Based UWB Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"1843a536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042333S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311006","isNumber":"7311794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311006","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7311794","articleId":"7311945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7311993,"authors":[{"name":"Marian Ca\u0163\u0103","affiliation":["Doctoral School on Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Ca\u0163\u0103","id":"37085701764"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8180-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8179-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8178-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2068-1038"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2247-5443"}],"articleNumber":"7311993","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1489},"abstract":"If the Internet has been one of the most important human creations, the Internet of Things (IoT) will change everything, activities and objects from simple to the most complex, and why not, even us humans.

Using Cloud has been considered to improve performance of data analysis for wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, it is expected that the physical or environmental conditions recorded by wireless sensors can be better explored if stored into the Cloud. Also, computation will be highly reduced as the data is processed on cloud. However, the problem of the delay when transferring heterogeneous data over the network needs to be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the integration of data gathered from telemetry sensor networks into applications using the distributed Cloud Computing technologies. Data security is an important factor of user's concern about the Cloud technology and it is relevant to both hardware and software components of the Cloud architecture.

Data offloading allows load distribution by suitably allocating data communication traffic to other systems, such as wireless LANs or vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems. Especially, there is also ongoing research into traffic offloading using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In traffic offloading using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, generally, while effectively utilizing mobile phone communication (V2I communication), vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V communication), in which content is shared among neighboring vehicles, is additionally used. In V2V communication, since the amount of data that can be transmitted at one time is not so large, and the opportunities for exchanging content are limited due to movement of vehicles, it is not easy to efficiently share relevant content within a certain period of time. Accordingly, we have designed an efficient content-delivery controlling algorithm for use in a situation where vehicles generate content in real time. The algorithm utilizes route prediction information in order to efficiently share content among the vehicles by way of V2X communication (i.e., V2I communication and V2V communication used in combination). This paper proposes the algorithm and reports its effectiveness demonstrated through simulated performance evaluation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contents Delivery Method Using Route Prediction in Traffic Offloading by V2X","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems","doi":"10.1109/INCoS.2015.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7308340/7312007/07312078.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INCoS.2015.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Contents Delivery Method Using Route Prediction in Traffic Offloading by V2X","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312078/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572970","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contents Delivery Method Using Route Prediction in Traffic Offloading by V2X","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"7695a239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086263S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7308340","isNumber":"7312007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7308340","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7312007","articleId":"7312078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7312080,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Zhenlin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, Engineering University of the Chinese Armed Police Force, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Zhenlin","id":"37085718202"},{"name":"Zhang Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, Engineering University of the Chinese Armed Police, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37590813500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7695-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7694-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312080","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Games","Polynomials","Servers","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predicate encryption scheme","multiparty cloud computation","ciphertext","access control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["predicate encryption","homomorphic","multiparty cloud computation"]}],"abstract":"Multiparty cloud computation can deal with the problem that the traditional homomorphic encryption can't operation on the ciphertexts generated by different users, and the final result is computed by cloud server.

To address the second concern we propose a novel application-level technique that we call event-driven Brownout. For each request, i.e., in an event-driven manner, the application can execute some optional code that is not required for correct operation but desirable for user experience, and does so only if the number of pending client requests is below a given threshold. We propose several autonomic algorithms, based on control theory and machine learning, to automatically tune this threshold based on measured application 95th percentile response times. We evaluate our approach using the RUBiS benchmark which shows a 11-fold improvement in maintaining response-time close to a set-point at high utilization compared to competing approaches. Our contribution is opening the path to more energy efficient data-centers, by allowing applications to keep response times close to a set-point even at high resource utilization.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312136","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312136.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.25","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.25","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Event-Driven Application Brownout: Reconciling High Utilization and Low Tail Response Times","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7312136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571388","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Driven Application Brownout: Reconciling High Utilization and Low Tail Response Times","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096885S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312140,"authors":[{"name":"Alina S\u00eerbu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alina","lastName":"S\u00eerbu","id":"37085621552"},{"name":"Ozalp Babaoglu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Ozalp","lastName":"Babaoglu","id":"37275857600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9566-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9565-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312140","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Correlation","Predictive models","Google","Training","Testing","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","fault tolerant computing","pattern classification","query processing","random processes","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven autonomics","data center","human operator","computer system","predictive computational model","data-science tool","low-level operation","holistic predictive model","data-science study","public Google dataset","node failure","BigQuery","big data SQL platform","Google Cloud suite","random forest classifier","central component","autonomic manager","data stream","data log","classification analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data science","predictive analytics","Google cluster trace","log data analysis","failure prediction","machine learning classification","ensemble classifier","random forest","BigQuery"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312140","abstract":"Continued reliance on human operators for managing data centers is a major impediment for them from ever reaching extreme dimensions. Large computer systems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed using predictive computational and executable models obtained through data-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using generated data, opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data centers. In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating a predictive model for node failures. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and generate a rich feature set characterizing machine state over time. We describe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers each trained on these features, to predict if machines will fail in a future 24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to 5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with precision varying between 50% and 72%. We discuss the practicality of including our predictive model as the central component of a data-driven autonomic manager and operating it on-line with live data streams (rather than off-line on data logs). All of the scripts used for BigQuery and classification analyses are publicly available from the authors' website.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.19","startPage":"45","endPage":"56","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312140.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Data-Driven Autonomics in Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards Data-Driven Autonomics in Data Centers","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312140/","accessionNumber":"15571410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312140/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Data-Driven Autonomics in Data Centers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088557S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7312149,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Department of System Engineering & Operations Research, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404863900"},{"name":"Chenbo Zhu","affiliation":["College of Economics and Management, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chenbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085609396"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9566-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9565-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312149","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Biological system modeling","Resource management","Pricing","Economics","Servers","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reclaimed computing resource allocation","penalty preference strategy","penalty averse strategy","service level agreements","long-term SLOs","service level objectives","opportunistic service class","resource under-utilization","economy cloud computing service class","capacity planning","optimal pricing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","service level objectives","pricing","capacity planning"]}],"abstract":"Resource under-utilization in cloud computing systems is widespread due to workload fluctuations and drives up the cost of cloud computing service. Offering service using slack resources in an opportunistic way improves the utilization of resources and the economics of cloud service providers. But Opportunistic service class comes with virtually no service level objectives (SLO) and thus is of limited use. In a recent study, a new Economy class was introduced to provide long-term SLOs using reclaimed cloud computing resources. Analysis based on the workload collected on six production cloud computing clusters at Google demonstrated the potential of the Economy class. This paper presents an analytic study on the optimal pricing and capacity planning of this new Economy class. We show that depending on the terms of the service level agreements and the characteristics of the cloud computing workloads, a cloud service provider may either choose a penalty averse or penalty preference strategy when allocating reclaimed computing resources to the Economy class cloud computing service. We also derive conditions under which the new Economy class will be profitable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Pricing and Capacity Planning of a New Economy Cloud Computing Service Class","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312149.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pricing and Capacity Planning of a New Economy Cloud Computing Service Class","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312149/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583002","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pricing and Capacity Planning of a New Economy Cloud Computing Service Class","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098177S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312155,"authors":[{"name":"Rafiul Ahad","affiliation":["Oracle Corporation, CA, USA"],"affiliationProfileUrl":"/institution/profile/50301","firstName":"Rafiul","lastName":"Ahad","id":"37389458300"},{"name":"Eric Chan","affiliation":["Oracle Corporation, CA, USA"],"affiliationProfileUrl":"/institution/profile/50301","firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085490576"},{"name":"Adriano Santos","affiliation":["Oracle Corporation, CA, USA"],"affiliationProfileUrl":"/institution/profile/50301","firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Santos","id":"37085655668"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9566-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9565-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312155","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Containers","Monitoring","Cloud computing","Quality of service","Assembly","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomic cloud","automatic anomaly detection","automatic anomaly resolution","response time anomalies","load anomalies","resource usage anomalies","outages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","Autonomic Systems","Anomaly","Rule-Based"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we describe an approach to implement an autonomic cloud.

We describe a hierarchical rule-based anomaly detection and resolution framework for such a class of metrics.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.32","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312155.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Autonomic Cloud: Automatic Anomaly Detection and Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Autonomic Cloud: Automatic Anomaly Detection and Resolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312155/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571383","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7312155/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Autonomic Cloud: Automatic Anomaly Detection and Resolution","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056736S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7312156,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) manage the relationship among cloud service providers and cloud consumers by defining the terms of the agreement for the participating entities and provide the basic ground for interactions among both the parties. In this work we proposed a framework to efficiently monitor and analyze the SLA parameters and tried to find out the possibility of occurrence of SLA violations. Also we implemented an adaptive resource allocation system by utilizing the results of predicted SLA violations. Our adaptive resource allocation system allocates computing resources to cloud applications and tries to reduce the occurrence of SLA violations, by allocating additional resources on the detection of possibility of occurrence of a violation. The experimental studies show that our proposed system works well in private cloud computing environment and gives more efficient results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring and Management of Service Level Agreements in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.28","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312156.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring and Management of Service Level Agreements in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312156/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571393","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring and Management of Service Level Agreements in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067573S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312163,"authors":[{"name":"Rohith Subramanyam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Rohith","lastName":"Subramanyam","id":"37085723784"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9566-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9565-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312163","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":282},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312163","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Throughput","Media","Random access memory","Generators","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","disc drives","hard discs","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HDFS","Hadoop distributed file system","heterogeneous storage resource management","data temperature","solid state drive","SSD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data storage systems","File systems"]}],"abstract":"Hadoop has traditionally been used as a large-scale batch processing system. However, interactive applications such as Facebook Messenger are becoming increasingly prominent in the Hadoop world. A key bottleneck in adapting Hadoop to real-time processing is disk data transfer rate. The advent of Solid State Drives (SSDs) holds great promise in this regard as they provide bandwidth on the orders of magnitude better than that of rotating disks. But due to their higher cost per gigabyte, a common approach is to have heterogeneous storage types. This paper presents a Storage Resource Management technique that automatically and dynamically moves data across this tiered storage based on Data Temperature, migrating \"hot\" data towards faster storage and \"cold\" data towards inexpensive archival storage. Thus, the cluster adapts based on the characteristics of the workloads over time to make effective use of the scarce expensive storage. Finally, I evaluate my modified version of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) against the vanilla version to compare their performances. The results are promising and show an improvement in both read and write performance with a significant improvement in read performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.33","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312163.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HDFS Heterogeneous Storage Resource Management Based on Data Temperature","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"HDFS Heterogeneous Storage Resource Management Based on Data Temperature","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571411","htmlLink":"/document/7312163/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HDFS Heterogeneous Storage Resource Management Based on Data Temperature","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057906S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312171,"authors":[{"name":"Loai Tawalbeh","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Umm-Alqura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia","Faculty of Computer and Information Technology, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Loai","lastName":"Tawalbeh","id":"37282658400"},{"name":"Raad S.

It can provide many services based on different needs and requirements. However, there are many issues related to the user data that need to be addressed when using cloud computing. Among the most important issues are: data ownership, data privacy, and storage. The users might be satisfied by the services provided by the cloud computing service providers, since they need not worry about the maintenance and storage of their data. On the other hand, they might be worried about unauthorized access to their private data. Some solutions to these issues were proposed in the literature, but they mainly increase the cost and processing time since they depend on encrypting the whole data. In this paper, we are introducing a cloud computing framework that classifies the data based on their importance. In other words, more important data will be encrypted with more secure encryption algorithm and larger key sizes, while less important data might even not be encrypted. This approach is very helpful in reducing the processing cost and complexity of data storage and manipulation since we do not need to apply the same sophisticated encryption techniques to the entire users data. The results of applying the proposed framework show improvement and efficiency over other existing frameworks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2015.45","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7311005/7312127/07312171.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2015.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure and Efficient Cloud Computing Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312171/","displayDocTitle":"Secure and Efficient Cloud Computing Framework","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312171/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure and Efficient Cloud Computing Framework","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"5636a291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072677S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7311005","isNumber":"7312127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7311005","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7312127","articleId":"7312171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7312202,"authors":[{"name":"H.

So the focus of utility companies has shifted towards increased customer focus, enhanced performance and to provide reliable supply at low cost. The electric power system must be operated in a way to schedule generations economically of generation facilities. In last two decades many evolutionary techniques has been developed to solve the optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization has acquired much recognition due to less memory requirement and its inherent simplicity. Particle swarm optimization technique proved to be having strong potential for solving complex and high dimensional optimization problem. PSO is free from local minimum solution convergence which is often encountered while solving nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem through conventional techniques.

They are often formed in a bottom-up style, which frequently leads to problems of process heterogeneity, redundancies and inconsistencies. Take a large Chinese communication company as an example, it comprises 31 provincial subsidiaries. Due to the heterogeneity of processes, the number of its Office Automation (OA) process schemas is up to more than 8000. This status poses serious challenges for operational activities, and hinders the company from achieving global strategy. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous business process consolidation approach based on business patterns in which a business is modeled as the interacting abstract business patterns. Each pattern can be further configured to meet a specific subsidiary's requirements. Considering the execution, each pattern is transformed into a set of connected workflow patterns or operational patterns, thus the proposed approach can be realized on most workflow engines today. To provide the global view of business, we apply Complex Event Processing (CEP) on boundaries of business patterns that are aligned among all configuration of certain business pattern. Empirical study of the proposed approach in a large company reveals positive feedback with respect to process consolidation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSS.2014.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Service Sciences","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Service Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7309520/7311971/07312304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSS.2014.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7311971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Business Process Consolidation: A Pattern-Driven Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Companies","Process modeling","Standards organizations","Stakeholders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","office automation","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous business process consolidation","pattern-driven approach","process heterogeneity","office automation","OA process","complex event processing","CEP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneity","process consolidation","complex event processing","pattern","business artifact"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Business Process Consolidation: A Pattern-Driven Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571281","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7312304/","conferenceDate":"22-23 May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312304/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Business Process Consolidation: A Pattern-Driven Approach","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4330a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069912S","chronDate":"22-23 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7309520","isNumber":"7311971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7309520","xplore-issue":"7311971","articleId":"7312304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312310,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Fu","affiliation":["Inspur Group Co.

However, the connection of a large number of DERs among the load on middle-voltage/low-voltage feeders can result in severe voltage regulation problems. These challenges motivate the application of wireless sensor networks into microgrid. In this paper, several sensor selection schemes are heuristically proposed to improve the voltage measurement performance, prolong the sensor network lifetime, and guarantee the real-time communication between the distributed sensors and the intelligent control center. First, aiming to accurately monitor the real-time voltage level, we propose an opportunistic sensor selection scheme under equal power allocation and investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the voltage measurement performance. Furthermore, we address the sensor selection scheme under optimal power allocation and derive a reminiscent of \u201cwater-filling\u201d solution. The proposed sensor selection schemes are applied and verified in the context of voltage regulation. In addition, we present the studies on the tradeoff between the voltage measurement and the sensor power consumption. Finally, we explore the joint power and spectrum allocation schemes to maximize the transmission rate between the sensors and the control center based on sensor selection. The theoretical analysis and proof are instrumental to the future wireless network design in microgrid.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2490721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8323440/07312396.pdf","endPage":"547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sensor Selection Schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks in Microgrid","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2490721","startPage":"539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sensor Selection Schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks in Microgrid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312396/","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17649973","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7312396/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1247848, CNS-1116749 and CNS-0964713"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sensor Selection Schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks in Microgrid","sourcePdf":"jsyst-wang-2490721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074284S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8323440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8323440","articleId":"7312396","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7312397,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Ran Zhang received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","He is currently with the Broadband Communication Research (BBCR) Group, University of Waterloo.

In HetNets, the IoT users with ubiquitous mobility support or low-rate services requirement can connect with macrocells (MCells), while femtocells (FCells) with PSU mechanism can be deployed to serve the IoT users requiring high-data-rate transmissions within small coverage. Despite the great potentials of HetNets in supporting various IoT applications, the following challenges exist: 1) how to depict the unplanned random behaviors of the IoT-oriented FCells and cope with the randomness in user QoS provisioning and 2) how to model the interplay of resource allocation (RA) between MCells and FCells under PSU mechanism. In this work, the stochastic geometry (SG) theory is first exploited to statistically analyze how the unplanned random behaviors of the IoT-oriented FCells impact the user performance, considering the user QoS requirements and FCell PSU policy. Particularly, to satisfy the QoS requirements of different IoT user types, the concept of effective bandwidth (EB) is leveraged to provide the users with probabilistic QoS guarantee, and a heuristic algorithm named QA-EB algorithm is proposed to make the EB determination tractable. Then, the interplay of RA between the MCells and FCells is formulated into a two-level Stackelberg game, where the two parties try to maximize their own utilities through optimizing the macro-controlled interference price and the femto-controlled PSU policy. A backward induction method is proposed to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the derived SINR and ergodic throughput performance of different user types and demonstrate the Stackelberg equilibrium under varying user QoS requirements and spectrum aggregation capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7467596/07312397.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7467596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis on QoS Provisioning for Internet of Things in LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks With Partial Spectrum Usage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312397/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis on QoS Provisioning for Internet of Things in LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks With Partial Spectrum Usage","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985615","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312397/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Analysis on QoS Provisioning for Internet of Things in LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks With Partial Spectrum Usage","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhang-2496161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103484S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7467596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7467596","articleId":"7312397","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312399,"authors":[{"name":"Pengcheng Liu","affiliation":["University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"p":["Pengcheng Liu received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

The performance of the proposed system is verified by comparing its channel capacity with that of a conventional MIMO system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Single-RF MIMO System Based on Repetitive Pulse Width Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2496171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07312402.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2496171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel Single-RF MIMO System Based on Repetitive Pulse Width Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312402/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697201","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"ICT R&D Program of MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"B0101-15-1309"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Single-RF MIMO System Based on Repetitive Pulse Width Modulation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-cho-2496171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05661S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7374754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7374754","articleId":"7312402","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312403,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Ao Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Ao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085454620"},{"name":"Zhi-Hong Tu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Hong","lastName":"Tu","id":"37309974500"},{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Xin","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085362812"},{"name":"Xiao-Hu Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Hu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539932100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7312403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2032},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband antennas","Antenna measurements","Slot antennas","Microstrip","Microstrip antennas","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","microstrip antennas","multifrequency antennas","slot antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiator antenna","feeding microstrip","differential signals","dual sharp-selectivity notch-band characteristic","quarter-wavelength slits","half-wavelength stubs","dual second-order notched bands","common-mode suppression","differential stepped-slot UWB antenna","frequency 5.1 GHz to 8.47 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode suppression","differential antenna","notch-band","sharp selectivity","ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"]}],"abstract":"A differential stepped-slot UWB antenna with common-mode suppression and dual sharp-selectivity notched bands is proposed in this letter. The antenna adopts stepped slot as radiator to achieve ultrawideband. Under differential-mode operation, the stepped slot can be effectively excited by feeding microstrip, and differential signals can be radiated. However, under common-mode operation, the stepped slot would not be excited so that the common-mode suppression can be achieved. In order to achieve dual sharp-selectivity notch-band characteristic, quarter-wavelength slits are etched on the ground, and half-wavelength stubs are introduced beside the microstrip, respectively. As a result, dual second-order notched bands with sharp selectivity are obtained. The measured results show that the proposed antenna obtains good common-mode suppression characteristic and dual sharp-selectivity notched bands from 5.1 to 6.0 GHz and 7.83 to 8.47 GHz. Good agreement is achieved between the measured results and the simulated results.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2496159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07312403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2496159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Stepped-Slot UWB Antenna With Common-Mode Suppression and Dual Sharp-Selectivity Notched Bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential Stepped-Slot UWB Antenna With Common-Mode Suppression and Dual Sharp-Selectivity Notched Bands","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15906561","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7312403/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471172"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave","grantNumber":"K201406"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Stepped-Slot UWB Antenna With Common-Mode Suppression and Dual Sharp-Selectivity Notched Bands","sourcePdf":"lawp-tu-2496159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057765S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7312403","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312404,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Song","affiliation":["Research Institute for Nanodevice and Bio Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashi-hiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7312404/song-2496101-small.gif","p":["Hang Song received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic science and technology from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

In addition to power-consuming appliances, we adopt a photovoltaic (PV) panel as a power-producing appliance that acts as a micro-grid. An appliance operation is modeled in terms of uninterruptible sequence phases, given in a load demand profile with a goal of minimizing electricity cost fulfilling duration, energy requirement, and user preference constraints. An optimization algorithm, which can provide a schedule for smart home appliance usage, is proposed based on the mixed-integer programming technique. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of our proposed solution for appliance scheduling. We further show that adding a PV system in the home results in the reduction of electricity bills and the export of energy to the national grid in times when solar energy production is more than the demand of the home.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Appliance Scheduling Optimization in Smart Home Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2496117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07312407.pdf","startPage":"2176","endPage":"2190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2496117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312407","topic":"Smart Grids: A Hub of Interdisciplinary Research","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Appliance Scheduling Optimization in Smart Home Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7312407/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15591463","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Appliance Scheduling Optimization in Smart Home Networks","sourcePdf":"access-anpalagan-2496117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111221S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Smart Grids: A Hub of Interdisciplinary Research"],"articleId":"7312407","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312408,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38024919200"},{"name":"Shu Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37654519500"},{"name":"Qiang Guo","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085799237"},{"name":"Mingqi Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Radio Equipment Research Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mingqi","lastName":"Li","id":"38024538800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7312408","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312408","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Apertures","Planar arrays","Optimization","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","iterative methods","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniformly excited concentric ring arrays","improved integer GA","improved integer genetic algorithm","aperture sizes","IIGA","minimum element spacing constraint","peak sidelobe level","planar arrays synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","genetic algorithm","low sidelobe level","ring arrays","sparse arrays"]}],"abstract":"An improved integer genetic algorithm (IIGA) that overcomes the inefficient searching and the severe computational effort of genetic algorithms (GAs) has been presented.

To verify the concept, a 2\u00d72 array at C-band is designed and fabricated. The stub-loaded resonator (SLR) is employed as the feed of the antenna. The resonant characteristics of SLR and patch as well as the coupling between them are presented. The method of designing the integrated resonator-patch module is explained. This integrated design not only removes the need for separated filters and traditional 50 -\u03a9 interfaces but also improves the frequency response of the module. A comparison with the traditional patch array has been made, showing that the proposed design has a more compact size, wider bandwidth, better frequency selectivity, and out-of-band rejection. Such low-profile light weight broadband dual-polarized arrays are useful for space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and wireless communication applications. The simulated and measured results agree well, demonstrating a good performance in terms of impedance bandwidth, frequency selectivity, isolation, radiation pattern, and antenna gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"63","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15618593","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7312434/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimode Resonator-Fed Dual-Polarized Antenna Array With Enhanced Bandwidth and Selectivity","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"project \u201cDIFFERENT\u201d funded by EC FP7","grantNumber":"6069923"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/M013529/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multimode Resonator-Fed Dual-Polarized Antenna Array With Enhanced Bandwidth and Selectivity","sourcePdf":"tap-mao-2496099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063573S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7337475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"7337475","articleId":"7312434","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7312437,"authors":[{"name":"Peter E.

Grid codes are published by utilities and system operators to define the requirements for the interconnection of generation and other facilities to the grid. The purpose of the grid code requirements is to ensure reliability, stability, power quality, protection of equipment, and worker safety. These requirements are given at the point of interconnection (POI) with the transmission or distribution system and are different depending on the sizes and types of generation. Grid codes can cover a broad range of requirements, from continuous operational constraints to behavior during contingencies such as faults, and they vary considerably based on the issuer, their country or region, and the type of transmission or distribution system. Manufacturer specifications for wind turbines are generally given on a per-turbine basis at the collector system voltage. When a wind farm is proposed, an initial assessment is made of the suitability of the wind turbines to the system. Studies that evaluate system performance and conformance with the grid code are performed of the grid and wind farm(s) being considered. Finally, tests and measurements during and after commissioning verify conformance of the wind farm to the applicable grid code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312437/","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312437/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15660703","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring Stable Operation with Grid Codes: A Look at Canadian Wind Farm Interconnections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring Stable Operation with Grid Codes: A Look at Canadian Wind Farm Interconnections","sourcePdf":"22mias01-sutherland-2459105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050251S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"7347537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7347537","articleId":"7312437","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312438,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohu Liang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Satellite Communications, College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085630118"},{"name":"Aijun Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Satellite Communications, College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST, China"],"firstName":"Aijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"38183373700"},{"name":"Xiaofei Pan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Satellite Communications, College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085611581"},{"name":"Qingshuang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Satellite Communications, College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST, China"],"firstName":"Qingshuang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085341337"},{"name":"Feng Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Satellite Communications, College of Communications Engineering, PLAUST, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085616427"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7312438","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":633},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New and Accurate Estimator With Analytical Expression for Frequency Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312438","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Mathematical model","Estimation","Complexity theory","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency estimation","interpolation","nonlinear functions","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical expression","frequency estimation","single complex exponential waveform","complex exponential sine waveform","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","nonlinear functions","interpolation method","DFT samples","SNR threshold","Cramer-Rao bound","CRB","discrete Fourier transform","signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency estimation","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","interpolation","signal processing"]},{"kwd":["Frequency estimation","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","interpolation","signal processing"]}],"abstract":"Frequency estimation of a single complex exponential waveform is an important problem in many fields.

The proposed antenna is simple in structure yet can achieve high gain and wide bandwidth, and is constructed using only a single layer laminate via standard printed-circuit-board (PCB) technology. Circular polarization is realized by a rotationally symmetric windmill-shaped patch-aperture formation with travelling wave distribution. The physical aperture of the antenna is constituted by an opening cavity structure formed by metalized vias, which offers high-gain unidirectional radiation pattern. Measurement results of a prototype operating at 60 GHz band show a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 17.9% (56.5-67.5 GHz), which is within its -10-dB impedance bandwidth. Meanwhile, the left-handed CP (LHCP) gain is stable throughout the operating bandwidth with a peak gain of 13.4 dBi. The proposed antenna is a promising candidate for various consumer level millimeter-wave (mmWave) band applications due to its merits of wideband, high gain, simple structure, low cost, and easy integration with differential circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2496116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7337475/07312444.pdf","startPage":"5316","endPage":"5324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2496116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly Polarized Planar Aperture Antenna for Millimeter-Wave Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312444/","displayDocTitle":"Circularly Polarized Planar Aperture Antenna for Millimeter-Wave Applications","volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618622","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312444/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB339900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372056"},{"fundingName":"Science Technology and Innovation Committee of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JSGG20150331154209122"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circularly Polarized Planar Aperture Antenna for Millimeter-Wave Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-xue-2496116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083302S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7337475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7337475","articleId":"7312444","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7312448,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Kumar Saini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Rohit Kumar","lastName":"Saini","id":"37085505931"},{"name":"Santanu Dwari","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Dwari","id":"38666708800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7312448","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3842},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Slot antennas","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Feeds","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","electromagnetic wave polarisation","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguide-fed broadband dual circularly polarized square slot antenna","square slot","asymmetric T-shaped feed line","inverted-L grounded strip","axial ratio bandwidth","AR bandwidth","return loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","Dual Circularly Polarized","Slot Antenna"]},{"kwd":["Broadband","dual circularly polarized (CP)","slot antenna"]}],"abstract":"A novel coplanar waveguide-fed broadband dual circularly polarized square slot antenna is presented.

Some recent works build the graph using sparse, low-rank, and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-norm-based representation, and have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods have suffered from the following two limitations. First, the time complexities of these methods are at least proportional to the cube of the data size, which make those methods inefficient for solving the large-scale problems. Second, they cannot cope with the out-of-sample data that are not used to construct the similarity graph. To cluster each out-of-sample datum, the methods have to recalculate the similarity graph and the cluster membership of the whole data set. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that makes the representation-based subspace clustering algorithms feasible to cluster both the out-of-sample and the large-scale data. Under our framework, the large-scale problem is tackled by converting it as the out-of-sample problem in the manner of sampling, clustering, coding, and classifying. Furthermore, we give an estimation for the error bounds by treating each subspace as a point in a hyperspace. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark data sets show that our methods outperform several recently proposed scalable methods in clustering a large-scale data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for

Several factors have to be considered when using the owned power sources for satisfying the demand, i.e., production rate, battery charge and status, variable cost of externally bought energy, and so on. The objective of this paper is to develop appropriate neural network architectures that automatically and continuously govern power production and dispatch, in order to maximize the overall benefit over a long time. Such a control will improve the fundamental work of a smart grid. For this, status data of several components have to be gathered, and then an estimate of future power production and demand is needed. Hence, the neural network-driven forecasts are apt in this paper for renewable nonprogrammable energy sources. Then, the produced energy as well as the stored one can be supplied to consumers inside a smart grid, by means of digital technology. Among the sought benefits, reduced costs and increasing reliability and transparency are paramount.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7514298/07312461.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2480709","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2480709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7514298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Strategy for Optimal Management of Smart Grids by Wavelet RNNs and Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Strategy for Optimal Management of Smart Grids by Wavelet RNNs and Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312461/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312461/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16141446","pubMedId":"26540716","volume":"27","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Strategy for Optimal Management of Smart Grids by Wavelet RNNs and Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tnnls-napoli-2480709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133406S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7514298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7514298","articleId":"7312461","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312464,"authors":[{"name":"Irina E.

Replacing the nonzero elements of a binary parity-check matrix (the base or parent matrix) either by circulants or by companion matrices of elements from a finite field GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n), we obtain quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) block codes and binary images of nonbinary LDPC block codes, respectively. By substituting monomials of a formal variable D, we obtain the polynomial description of an LDPC convolutional code. A set of performance measures applicable to different classes of LDPC codes is considered, and a greedy algorithm for code performance optimization is presented. The heart of the new optimization algorithm is a fast procedure for searching for LDPC codes with large girth of their Tanner graphs. For a few classes of LDPC codes, examples of codes combining good error-correcting performance with compact representation are obtained. In particular, we present optimized convolutional LDPC codes and conclude that the LDPC block codes are still superior to their convolutional counterparts if both decoding complexity and coding delay are considered. Moreover, a specific channel model can easily be embedded into the optimization loop. Thereby, the code can be optimized for a specific channel. The efficiency of such an optimization is demonstrated via an example of faster than Nyquist (FTN) signaling using LDPC codes. The FTN strategy combined with a rate R = 1/2 LDPC code of length 64800 optimized for effective data rate R = 3/4 gains more than 0.5 dB compared with the standard LDPC codes of the same rate and length. The obtained gain corresponds to transmission at the capacity of the binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel. In most numerical examples, we consider codes with bidiagonal structure of the parity-check matrix. This restriction preserves low encoding complexity and allows fair comparison with codes selected for communication standards.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2496213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7360961/07312464.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2496213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Searching for Binary and Nonbinary Block and Convolutional LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Searching for Binary and Nonbinary Block and Convolutional LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312464/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15669109","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312464/","volume":"62","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Searching for Binary and Nonbinary Block and Convolutional LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-bocharova-2496213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161699S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7360961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7360961","articleId":"7312464","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7312469,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Yu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7331113/7312469/chen-2492421-small.gif","p":["Pai-Yu Chen (S\u201915) received the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2013.

The T2FCMAC realizes an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system based on the structure of the CMAC. Due to the better ability of handling uncertainties, type-2 fuzzy sets can solve some complicated problems with outstanding effectiveness than type-1 fuzzy sets. In addition, the Lyapunov function is utilized to derive the conditions of the adaptive learning rates, so that the convergence of the filtering error can be guaranteed. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptive T2FCMAC filter, it is tested in signal processing applications, including a nonlinear channel equalization system, a time-varying channel equalization system, and an adaptive noise cancellation system.

Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled `seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While features learned with our approach cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2496141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7530937/07312476.pdf","startPage":"1734","endPage":"1747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2496141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Exemplar Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Exemplar Convolutional Neural Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312476/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191137","pubMedId":"26540673","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"ERC","grantNumber":"279401"},{"fundingName":"BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation","grantNumber":"EXC 1086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Exemplar Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tpami-dosovitskiy-2496141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143318S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7312476","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7312489,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Lin Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Maritime Information and Technology, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7904756/7312489/kuo-2478855-small.gif","p":["Chao-Lin Kuo received the B.S. degree from the Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung City, Taiwan, in 1998; the M.S. degree from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, in 2000; and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, in 2006.","Since 2011, he has been with National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, where he is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Maritime Information and Technology.

Based on electrical examination method, output power degradation is used to monitor physical conditions with changes in a PV array's circuitry, including grounded faults, mismatch faults, bridged faults between two PV panels, and open-circuit faults. The PV array power depends on solar radiation and temperature, and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is used to maintain stable power supply to a microdistribution system in the event of a fault in the PVECS. The MPPT algorithm is employed to estimate the desired maximum power, which is then compared with the meter-read power. Fractional-order dynamic errors are determined to quantify output power degradation between the desired maximum power and the meter-read power. Then, a color relation analysis is used to separate normal conditions from fault events. For a PVECS with two panels in parallel, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for real-time applications and is flexible for fault identification. Its detection rates exceeded 88.23% for six events.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2478855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The recurrence field and current equations for terahertz (THz) wave propagation in the plasma are deduced and discretized using the auxiliary differential equation finite-difference time-domain (ADE-FDTD) method. The reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients of a time-varying dusty plasma slab are calculated by using the ADE-FDTD method. The numerical results indicate that the reflection coefficients of the slab are easily affected by the rise time of the electron density. Besides, the absorption coefficients increase with the decrease in the rise time and working frequency as well as with the increase in the densities of electrons and dust particles. It is shown that THz waves may have potential applications in radio communications with a spacecraft at its re-entry into the atmosphere.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2015.2493001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/7350355/07312490.pdf","startPage":"4182","endPage":"4186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2015.2493001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Properties of Terahertz Waves in a Time-Varying Dusty Plasma Slab Using FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312490/","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Properties of Terahertz Waves in a Time-Varying Dusty Plasma Slab Using FDTD","volume":"43","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661624","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312490/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120185120012"},{"fundingName":"Oversea Academic Training Fund through the China Scholarship Council and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"201306075027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41104097, 41304119 and 61201007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Properties of Terahertz Waves in a Time-Varying Dusty Plasma Slab Using FDTD","sourcePdf":"tps-wang-2493001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073953S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"7350355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7350355","articleId":"7312490","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312491,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7312491/liu-2496188-small.gif","p":["Ying Liu (S'13) was born in Sichuan, China, in 1985.

As a key technology in wireless transmitting systems, digital predistortion (DPD) is widely applied to compensate for the transmitter nonlinearities and ensure high power-added efficiency in base stations and mobile devices for cellular systems. In a DPD architecture, the transmitter input and output signals are sampled, aligned, and processed to extract the DPD parameters that would be used to predistort the source signal before transmission to counteract the transmitter nonlinearities. However, the alignment accuracy in DPD is limited by nonideal electronic components and the associated circuitry, which introduces unknown loop delay mismatch and, thus, degrades the overall linearization performance. In this paper, we analyze the effect of a loop delay mismatch on PA model identification and, hence, on DPD linearization performance of the wideband OFDM signals. The expression and upper limit for the normalized mean square error (NMSE) are derived in terms of the loop delay mismatch, transmission signal bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the feedback channel. The expression for the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) performance is also derived to predict the DPD linearization performance with the presence of the loop delay mismatch. The theoretical analysis reveals that the performance degradation increases with the bandwidth of the OFDM signal and the modulus of the loop delay mismatch. Experiments are performed on the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced signals with bandwidth ranging from 20 to 100 MHz to evaluate the degradation effect of the loop delay mismatch on the NMSE and ACLR

According to the layout topology of a 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) static random access memory (SRAM) arrays, the sensitive volumes (SVs) of off and on-transistors were calibrated by TCAD using novel circuit schematics. The effects of on-transistor charge collection on SEU were studied, and a novel criterion for SEU occurrence is proposed. Heavy ion simulation results indicate that the probability of SEU recovery increased with increased ion energy and striking tilt. The simulated SEU cross section and multiple cell upsets (MCUs) percentage based on the proposed method are in agreement with the experimental data for 6 T SRAM cells, which were fabricated using 65 nm processing technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661866","htmlLink":"/document/7312501/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Event Upset Prediction in SRAMs Account for On-Transistor Sensitive Volume","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Event Upset Prediction in SRAMs Account for On-Transistor Sensitive Volume","sourcePdf":"tns-tianqi-2480880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085793S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7348739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7348739","articleId":"7312501","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312503,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7546948/7312503/7312503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaozhe Wang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in information science & electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2010, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA."]},"firstName":"Xiaozhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085422903"},{"name":"Konstantin Turitsyn","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7546948/7312503/7312503-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Konstantin Turitsyn (M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree from Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Russia, in 2007.","He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA.

Results indicate that the standard method performs as well as or better than its competitors.

Suppressing the input source and using, instead, an outer-tier auxiliary generator, together with the Norton equivalent of the input network, analysis difficulties associated with turning points are avoided. The turning-point locus in the plane defined by any two relevant analysis parameters is obtained in a straightforward manner using a geometrical condition. The hysteresis phenomenon is demonstrated to be due to a nonlinear resonance of the device input capacitance under near optimum matching conditions. When increasing the drain bias voltage, some points of the locus degenerate into a large-signal oscillation that cannot be detected with a stability analysis of the dc solution. In driven conditions, the oscillation will be extinguished either through synchronization or inverse Hopf bifurcations in the upper section of the multivalued curves.

Its motivation stems from the observation that such systems are characterized by an unconventional topology along with the presence of a number of buses with bursty power injection patterns, which in turn significantly impacts the temporal and spatial correlation of the nodal voltage phasors. Simulation results carried out on three IEEE test systems reveal that this new pattern affects the number of dominant buses, termed electrical hubs, and, subsequently, the time and spatial correlation among nodal voltage angles. They also reveal that the nodal voltage magnitudes exhibit time correlation, but no spatial correlation. In this paper, time series are represented by autoregressive (AR) processes while multivariate time series with spatial correlation are represented by vector autoregressive (VAR) processes. Statistical tests show that an order one for both models is adequate. The non-zero parameters of the VAR(1) models are identified using metrics on electrical connectivity, centrality, and node significance. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-, 118-, and 300-bus test systems in presence of large-scale distributed wind farms and microgrids, and under loss of system observability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312519/","volume":"31","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7312519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16230385","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Short-Term Nodal Voltage Phasor Forecasting Method Using Temporal and Spatial Correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Short-Term Nodal Voltage Phasor Forecasting Method Using Temporal and Spatial Correlation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-evrenosoglu-2487419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09283S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7546948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7546948","articleId":"7312519","onlineDate":"29 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7312606,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Groza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Groza","id":"37540343300"},{"name":"Lidia Corde","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Lidia","lastName":"Corde","id":"37085712597"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8200-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8199-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312606","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312606","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Cognition","Pipelines","Information retrieval","Morphology","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["history","inference mechanisms","information retrieval","natural language processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","natural language processing","information extraction","literary characters","unstructured texts","reasoning","domain ontologies","story characters","folktale domain","folktale ontology","Propp model","folktale morphology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural language processing","ontologies","literary character","folktales"]}],"abstract":"Our aim is to extract information about literary characters in unstructured texts.

For this reason, an accurate probabilistic inverse sensor model of the omnidirectional stereo sensor is estimated based on training data. The obtained model considers not only the Gaussian spread of 3D points but also the systematic translations and errors from the calibration and rectification processes. The inverse sensor model is obtained by calculating the prior probabilities of 3D points corresponding to each DEM cell and the direct sensor model, describing the way measurements are acquired.

For each 3D point the probability of correspondence to the neighboring cells is calculated and the obtained values are added to the height histogram of each cell. Instead of adding to a single bucket in the histogram, the contribution is spread based on the standard deviation of the height. In order to increase the contribution of individual points in sparse areas and to decrease it in dense areas, the relative density of 3D points in local patches is precomputed and is used as a decreasing exponential term. Based on the obtained models, an improved DEM creation algorithm is applied. The obtained elevation map provides better results both in terms of accuracy and detection rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312635","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301668/7312586/07312635.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic inverse sensor model based Digital Elevation Map creation for an omnidirectional stereovision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312635/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic inverse sensor model based Digital Elevation Map creation for an omnidirectional stereovision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572049","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312635/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic inverse sensor model based Digital Elevation Map creation for an omnidirectional stereovision system","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2015231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117476S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301668","isNumber":"7312586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7312586","articleId":"7312635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7312666,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

However, metallic-based on-chip interconnects may not scale to support kilo-core architectures due to increased hop count, high power dissipation, and increased latency. Emerging technologies such as silicon-photonics and wireless interconnects are under serious consideration as they show promising results for power-efficient, low-latency, and scalable on-chip interconnects. However, photonic technology suffers from scalability issues due to high component cost and complex arbitration while wireless technology lacks sufficient bandwidth for on-chip communication. In this paper, we propose an architecture called Optical-Wireless Network-on-Chip (OWN) that leverages the advantages of wireless and photonic technologies while circumventing the disadvantages of these two emerging technologies. Kilo-core OWN is designed such that one-hop photonic interconnect is used up to 64 cores (called a cluster). For communication beyond a cluster, one-hop wireless interconnect is proposed to enhance scalability. Both wireless and photonic bandwidths are efficiently shared using time division multiplexing (TDM). Moreover, packets routed across technologies are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. Our area results indicate that OWN requires 34% more area than hybrid-wireless architectures and 35.5% less area than photonic architectures. The energy/bit for OWN is 30.36% less than wireless and 13.99% more than photonic architecture. OWN demonstrates higher saturation throughput when compared to wired, wireless, and photonic technologies for synthetic network traffic.","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2015.14","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd Annual Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd Annual Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312649/7312546/07312666.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2015.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OWN: Optical and Wireless Network-on-Chip for Kilo-core Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312666/","displayDocTitle":"OWN: Optical and Wireless Network-on-Chip for Kilo-core Architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312666/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OWN: Optical and Wireless Network-on-Chip for Kilo-core Architectures","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"9160a044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064249S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312649","isNumber":"7312546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312649","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7312546","articleId":"7312666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7312670,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled E.

The bus topology and its derivatives are the most deployed communication architectures in contemporary SoCs. Space switching exemplified by cross bars and multiplexers, and time sharing are the key enablers of various bus architectures. The cross bar has quadratic complexity while resource sharing significantly degrades the overall system's performance. In this work we motivate using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) as a bus sharing strategy which offers many advantages over other topologies. Our work seeks to complement the conventional CDMA bus features by applying overloaded CDMA practices to increase the bus utilization efficiency. We propose the Difference-Overloaded CDMA Interconnect (D-OCI) bus that leverages the balancing property of the Walsh codes to increase the number of interconnected elements by 50%. Two implementations of the D-OCI bus optimized for both speed and resource utilization are presented. The bus operation is validated on a Xilinx Artix-7 AC701 FPGA kit and the bus performance is evaluated and compared to other existing bus topologies. We also present the synthesis results for the UMC-0.13 \u03bcm design kit to give an idea of the maximum achievable bus frequency on ASIC platforms. Moreover, we advance a proof-of-concept HLS implementation of the D-OCI bus on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC and compare its performance, latency, and resource utilization to the ARM AXI bus. The performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the D-OCI bus.","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2015.12","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd Annual Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 23rd Annual Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312649/7312546/07312670.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2015.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312546","startPage":"78","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Overloaded CDMA Interconnect (OCI) Bus Architecture for On-Chip Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Overloaded CDMA Interconnect (OCI) Bus Architecture for On-Chip Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312670/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573058","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7312670/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Overloaded CDMA Interconnect (OCI) Bus Architecture for On-Chip Communication","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"9160a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115863S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312649","isNumber":"7312546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312649","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7312546","articleId":"7312670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7312681,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Makantasis","affiliation":["Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Makantasis","id":"37073282100"},{"name":"Eftychios Protopapadakis","affiliation":["Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Eftychios","lastName":"Protopapadakis","id":"37070634700"},{"name":"Anastasios Doulamis","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Doulamis","id":"37271469800"},{"name":"Nikolaos Doulamis","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Doulamis","id":"37265588200"},{"name":"Constantinos Loupos","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Loupos","id":"37085637270"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8200-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8199-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312681","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1356},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Visualization","Image edge detection","Concrete","Inspection","Entropy","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["civil engineering computing","computer vision","function approximation","geotechnical engineering","inspection","learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering","multilayer perceptrons","tunnels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural networks","vision based tunnel inspection","civil infrastructure inspection","civil infrastructure assessment","civil infrastructure maintenance","operation safety","automated tunnel assessment approach","monocular camera","deep learning architectures","defect detector training","high-level features","global function approximation properties","feedforward nature","multilayer perceptrons"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312681","pdfPath":"/iel7/7301668/7312586/07312681.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for efficient vision based tunnel inspection","abstract":"The inspection, assessment, maintenance and safe operation of the existing civil infrastructure consists one of the major challenges facing engineers today. Such work requires either manual approaches, which are slow and yield subjective results, or automated approaches, which depend upon complex handcrafted features. Yet, for the latter case, it is rarely known in advance which features are important for the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose a fully automated tunnel assessment approach; using the raw input from a single monocular camera we hierarchically construct complex features, exploiting the advantages of deep learning architectures. Obtained features are used to train an appropriate defect detector. In particular, we exploit a Convolutional Neural Network to construct high-level features and as a detector we choose to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron due to its global function approximation properties. Such an approach achieves very fast predictions due to the feedforward nature of Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptrons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312681/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15572065","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312681/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for efficient vision based tunnel inspection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for efficient vision based tunnel inspection","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2015335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091836S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301668","isNumber":"7312586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301668","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7312586","articleId":"7312681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7312773,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Di Battista","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Di Battista","id":"37267058300"},{"name":"Valentino Di Donato","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentino","lastName":"Di Donato","id":"37085763726"},{"name":"Maurizio Patrignani","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Patrignani","id":"37267060000"},{"name":"Maurizio Pizzonia","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Pizzonia","id":"37294504700"},{"name":"Vincenzo Roselli","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Roselli","id":"37085755381"},{"name":"Roberto Tamassia","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Tamassia","id":"37269663200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7599-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7598-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7312773","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":2399},"abstract":"Bitcoin is a digital currency whose transactions are stored into a public ledger, called blockchain, that can be viewed as a directed graph with more than 70 million nodes, where each node represents a transaction and each edge represents Bitcoins flowing from one transaction to another one.

The study is presented in the context of creating an all-analogue real-time multigigabit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing electro-optical transceiver for short range and high-capacity data center networks. Passive microwave filters are used to perform the pulse shaping of the bit streams, allowing an orthogonal transmission without the necessity of digital signal processing (DSP). Accordingly, a cyclic prefix that would cause a reduction in the net data rate is not required. An experiment consisting of three orthogonally spaced 2.7 Gbaud quadrature phase shift keyed subchannels demonstrates that the spectral efficiency of traditional DSP-less subcarrier multiplexed links can be potentially doubled. A sensitivity of -29.5 dBm is achieved in a 1-km link.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2496285","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7332227/07312891.pdf","startPage":"5073","endPage":"5083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2496285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7332227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Analogue Real-Time Broadband Filter Bank Multicarrier Optical Communications System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312891/","displayDocTitle":"All-Analogue Real-Time Broadband Filter Bank Multicarrier Optical Communications System","volume":"33","issue":"24","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15602789","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312891/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EI CFTD","grantNumber":"CF/2011/1627"},{"fundingName":"SFI","grantNumber":"09/IN.1/12653 and 10/CE/I1853"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L000091/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Analogue Real-Time Broadband Filter Bank Multicarrier Optical Communications System","sourcePdf":"jlt-gutierrez-2496285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130348S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7332227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7332227","articleId":"7312891","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312896,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey A.

Our experimental results show that the selection of the reference current significantly affects the uniqueness. More dummy cells to generate the reference can improve the uniqueness of RRAM. The reliability of RRAM PUF is determined by the RRAM data retention. A new design is proposed where the sum of the readout currents of multiple RRAM cells is used for generating one response bit, which statistically minimizes the risk of early lifetime failure. The experimental results show that with eight cells per bit, the retention time is more than 50 h at 150 \u00b0C or equivalently 10 years at 69 \u00b0C.

The smartwatch antenna must be low-profile, highly directive, low specified absorption rate (SAR), and robust to the loading effect due to a human body.

Furthermore, the characterization of HISs is determined by observing the reflection phase of a unit cell, but this method becomes improper for finite-size and miniaturized HISs.

These approaches have recently been found to outperform various baseline systems on different datasets, but they have not yet been compared to each other or to a common baseline. Two of these approaches use the DNNs to generate feature vectors which are then processed in different ways to predict the score of each language given a test sample. The features are extracted either from a bottleneck layer in the DNN or from the output layer. In the third approach, the standard i-vector extraction procedure is modified to use the senones as classes and the DNN to predict the zeroth order statistics. We compare these three approaches and conclude that the approach based on bottleneck features followed by i-vector modeling outperform the other two approaches. We also show that score-level fusion of some of these approaches leads to gains over using a single approach for short-duration test samples. Finally, we demonstrate that fusing systems that use DNNs trained with several languages leads to improvements in performance over the best single system, and we propose an adaptation procedure for DNNs trained with languages with less available data. Overall, we show improvements between 40% and 70% relative to a state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) i-vector system on test durations from 3 seconds to 120 seconds on two significantly different tasks: the NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation task and the DARPA RATS language identification task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Senone-Based Deep Neural Network Approaches for Spoken Language Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2496226","startPage":"105","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2496226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322312","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7322312/07312905.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Study of Senone-Based Deep Neural Network Approaches for Spoken Language Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312905/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15614885","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"D10PC20024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Senone-Based Deep Neural Network Approaches for Spoken Language Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-ferrer-2496226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101317S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7322312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7322312","articleId":"7312905","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312909,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Noori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Noori","orcid":"0000-0002-7524-4240","id":"37703264400"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"38247185800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7312909","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312909","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Decision support systems","Probabilistic logic","Servers","Upper bound","Spread spectrum communication","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","storage allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative algorithm","overall storage budget","individual node capacities","k-guaranteed allocations","storage allocation problem","DSS","distributed storage system","storage nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed storage systems","storage allocation","heterogeneous storage capacities"]},{"kwd":["Distributed storage systems","storage allocation","heterogeneous storage capacities"]}],"abstract":"Storage allocation, meaning the way that a chunk of data is stored over a set of storage nodes, affects different performance measures of a distributed storage system (DSS). In this work, we study the storage allocation problem for a DSS where nodes have different storage capacities. To this end, we first introduce the notion of k-guaranteed allocations referring to allocations where the data can be recovered by accessing any arbitrary set of k storage nodes. We then find the necessary conditions for an allocation to be k-guaranteed considering the limit on the individual node capacities and the overall storage budget. Using these conditions, an iterative algorithm is developed to find k-guaranteed allocations, if feasible.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2496235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07312909.pdf","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2496235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation for Heterogeneous Storage Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Allocation for Heterogeneous Storage Nodes","volume":"19","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661688","htmlLink":"/document/7312909/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000146","fundingName":"Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002790","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"Telus Corporation for supporting their research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation for Heterogeneous Storage Nodes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-noori-2496235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050192S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7312909","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7312919,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Cun Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi Cun","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37085763330"},{"name":"I Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I Chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088712742"},{"name":"Chih Cheng Shih","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih Cheng","lastName":"Shih","id":"38580700200"},{"name":"Kuan Chang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan Chang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37578271800"},{"name":"Chao Hsien Huang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao Hsien","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088710180"},{"name":"Po Hsun Chen","affiliation":["Advanced Optoelectronics Technology Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po Hsun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085731328"},{"name":"Ting-Chang Chang","affiliation":["Advanced Optoelectronics Technology Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Chang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292029400"},{"name":"Tsung Ming Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung Ming","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37416047700"},{"name":"Jing Shuen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing Shuen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37087871015"},{"name":"J.

However, experiments are often performed on data selected by the researchers, which may come from different institutions, scanners, and populations. Different evaluation measures may be used, making it difficult to compare the methods. In this paper, we introduce a dataset of 7909 breast cancer histopathology images acquired on 82 patients, which is now publicly available from http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. The dataset includes both benign and malignant images. The task associated with this dataset is the automated classification of these images in two classes, which would be a valuable computer-aided diagnosis tool for the clinician. In order to assess the difficulty of this task, we show some preliminary results obtained with state-of-the-art image classification systems. The accuracy ranges from 80% to 85%, showing room for improvement is left. By providing this dataset and a standardized evaluation protocol to the scientific community, we hope to gather researchers in both the medical and the machine learning field to advance toward this clinical application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","volume":"63","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16088949","pubMedId":"26540668","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7312934/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Dataset for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"National Council for Scientific and Technological Development","grantNumber":"#301653/2011-9"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel","grantNumber":"#263/2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dataset for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tbme-spanhol-2496264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102848S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7493713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"365","xplore-issue":"7493713","articleId":"7312934","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7312936,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Sigaud","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR 7222, Paris, France","CNRS, Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique UMR7222, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274989/7486942/7312936/7312936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Sigaud received the Ph.D. degree in philosophy, in 2004.","He is currently a Full Professor in Computer Science at the University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.

Our prior deployments of an embedded wireless imaging system at the James Reserve have already shown its feasibility and usefulness. However, we argue that data compression schemes employed in prior systems can be improved to provide higher image transfer rates per node, or lower the energy costs of wireless communication. In this paper, we develop an image compression scheme using K-means clustering on low-power embedded devices for image-based WSNs. Specifically, we use the similarity of pixel colors to group pixels and compress the original image. Using 100 000 images collected from our pilot deployments at the James Reserve, we study the applicability and impact of the proposed K-means clustering-based compression algorithm. Our results suggest that the cost of running K-means learning on a wireless sensor node may outweigh the benefit of data compression, but offloading the learning step and only performing the compression can provide significant energy gains. Specifically, our evaluations with real-world data sets show that our proposed scheme reduces power usage by ~49%, when sending image updates from a bird nest periodically every 15 min.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312938/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17390181","volume":"11","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Means Clustering-Based Data Compression Scheme for Wireless Imaging Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002460","fundingName":"Chung-Ang University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002619","fundingName":"Ajou University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Means Clustering-Based Data Compression Scheme for Wireless Imaging Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ko-2491359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085596S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8118221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8118221","articleId":"7312938","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7312942,"authors":[{"name":"Roopak Sinha","affiliation":["School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"p":["Roopak Sinha (S\u201903\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E.

One aspect that is lacking, however, is the ability to directly express Statecharts-like hierarchy and concurrency within basic function blocks (BFBs). Such features can significantly enhance function blocks and help create more succinct and readable specifications. We propose a new syntactic extension to the standard called hierarchical and concurrent execution control chart (HCECC). A major roadblock for any suggested changes to the standard is the need for compliance. Our approach extends the synchronous execution semantics of IEC 61499, where HCECCs are purely syntactic sugar. Using a revised synchronous semantics, our compiler generates standard compliant C code from HCECCs. Benchmarking and usability studies reveal the relative superiority of the proposed approach over existing approaches.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7398213/07312942.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical and Concurrent ECCs for IEC 61499 Function Blocks","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2496262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2496262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical and Concurrent ECCs for IEC 61499 Function Blocks","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755398","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical and Concurrent ECCs for IEC 61499 Function Blocks","sourcePdf":"tii-sinha-2496262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078893S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7312942","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312944,"authors":[{"name":"Amr A.

The channel fading models per hop are assumed to be independent and follow exponential random distribution, and the interference is distributed according to the spatial Poisson point process PPP, which is further known as symmetric alpha stable distribution. The impact of spatial dependence across multiple antennas is facilitated by considering three different network interference models: 1) the isotropic model, where all receive antennas see interference belonging to the same Poisson point process (PPP); 2) the independent model, where each receive antenna sees interference belonging to a different independent PPP; and 3) the mixture model, where each receive antenna sees the superposition of the two previous models. The end-to-end transmission is performed using two TAS modes, which includes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based selection, and signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR)-based selection. The analysis provides new analytical results for the outage probability and symbol error rates (SER). In addition, the impact of feedback delay on the performance of the proposed system for SNR-based selection is investigated. We further study the optimum resource allocation strategies including power allocation, position allocation, and joint allocation for power and position. The obtained results are clarified through selected numerical and simulated examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2496291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07312944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2496291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","startPage":"525","endPage":"540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of MIMO Multi-Hop System With TAS/MRC in Poisson Field of Interferers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of MIMO Multi-Hop System With TAS/MRC in Poisson Field of Interferers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786059","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7312944/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSREP","grantNumber":"3-039-2-010"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of MIMO Multi-Hop System With TAS/MRC in Poisson Field of Interferers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-abdelnabi-2496291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156644S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7312944","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312945,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxiang Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Fusion Technology (Ministry of Education of China), School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7312945/yang-2489218-small.gif","p":["\n\nJingxiang Yang (S'14) received the B.S. degree in automation from Anhui \nPolytechnic University, Wuhu, China, in 2011 and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from \nNorthwestern Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China, in 2014.

In this paper, a sparse representation framework that unifies denoising and spectral unmixing in a closed-loop manner is proposed. While conventional approaches treat denoising and unmixing separately, the proposed scheme utilizes spectral information from unmixing as feedback to correct spectral distortion. Both denoising and spectral unmixing act as constraints to the others and are solved iteratively. Noise is suppressed via sparse coding, and fractional abundance in spectral unmixing is estimated using the sparsity prior of endmembers from a spectral library. The abundance of endmembers is used as a spectral regularizer for denoising based on the hypothesis that spectral signatures obtained from a denoising process result are close to those of unmixing. Unmixing restrains spectral distortion and results in better denoising, which reciprocally leads to further improvements in unmixing. The strength of our proposed method is illustrated by simulated and real HSIs with performance competitive to the state-of-the-art denoising and unmixing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2489218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7419294/07312945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2489218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1818","endPage":"1833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Sparse Denoising and Unmixing With Low-Rank Constraint for Hyperspectral Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Sparse Denoising and Unmixing With Low-Rank Constraint for Hyperspectral Image","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312945/","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7312945/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823055","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371152, 61071172 and 61374162"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC and National Research Foundation of Korea Scientific Cooperation","grantNumber":"6151101013"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents Award Program from the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0464"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102015ZY045"},{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council for joint Ph.D. students","grantNumber":"201506290120"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Sparse Denoising and Unmixing With Low-Rank Constraint for Hyperspectral Image","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhao-2489218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118654S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7419294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7419294","articleId":"7312945","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7312949,"authors":[{"name":"Arnob Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/7095628/7312949/ghosh-2496578-small.gif","p":["Arnob Ghosh received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

In a secondary network, a secondary-base station (secondary-BS) transmits to a secondary-user terminal (secondary-UT) with certain power. Secondary-BSs are constrained to allocate transmitting powers such that the total interference at each primary-UT is below a given threshold. We formulate the power allocation problem as a concave noncooperative game with secondary-BSs as players and multiple primary-UTs enforcing coupled constraints. The equilibrium selection is based on the concept of normalized Nash equilibrium (NNE). When the interference at a secondary-UT from adjacent secondary-BSs is negligible, the NNE is shown to be unique for any strictly concave utility. The NNE is also shown to be the solution of a concave potential game. We propose a distributed algorithm, which converges to the unique NNE. When the interference at a secondary-UT from adjacent secondary-BSs is not negligible, an NNE may not be unique and the computation of the NNE has exponential complexity. To avoid these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of weakly normalized Nash equilibrium (WNNE), which keeps the most of NNEs' interesting properties but, in contrast to the latter, the WNNE can be determined with low complexity. We show the usefulness of the WNNE when the utility function is the Shannon capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15835985","publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7312949/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Normalized Nash Equilibrium for Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Commission within the framework of the CONGAS","grantNumber":"FP7-ICT-2011-8-317672"},{"fundingName":"IFCAM\u2014Indo French Joint Laboratory on Applied Mathematics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized Nash Equilibrium for Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tccn-ghosh-2496578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098925S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7095628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7095628","articleId":"7312949","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7312950,"authors":[{"name":"Diep N.

An integration that successfully embraces the two is far from trivial due to the dynamics of spectrum opportunities as well as the requirement to jointly optimize both spectrum allocation and spatial/antenna pattern in a distributed fashion. Regardless of spectrum dynamics and heterogeneity, existing literature on channel/power allocation in MIMO DSA systems is only applicable to centralized cases. Our objective here is to design distributed algorithms that jointly allocate opportunistic channels to various links and to simultaneously optimize the MIMO precoding matrices so as to achieve fairness or maximize network throughput. For self-interested DSA links, our distributed algorithm allows links to negotiate channel allocation based on Nash bargaining (NB) and configure the precoding matrices so that links' rate demands are guaranteed while the surplus resources (after meeting minimum rate demands) are fairly allocated. Next, we consider a network throughput maximization formulation (NET-MAX). Both the NB-based and NET-MAX problems are combinatorial with mixed variables. To tackle them, we first transform the original problems by incorporating the concept of timesharing. Using dual decomposition, we develop optimal distributed algorithms for timesharing case, which shed light on how to derive a distributed algorithm for the original problems. Our work fills a gap in the literature of channel allocation where a central controller is not available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Bargaining Mechanisms for MIMO Dynamic Spectrum Access Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2015.2496317","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/7095628/07312950.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2015.2496317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7095628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312950/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Bargaining Mechanisms for MIMO Dynamic Spectrum Access Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312950/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15835986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006445","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIP-1432880, IIP-1265960 and CNS-1513649"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-13-1-0302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (Discovery Early Career Researcher Award)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000943","fundingName":"CSIRO Macquarie University Chair in Wireless Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Bargaining Mechanisms for MIMO Dynamic Spectrum Access Systems","sourcePdf":"tccn-nguyen-2496317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104958S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7095628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","xplore-issue":"7095628","articleId":"7312950","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312952,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7312952/jiang-2496260-small.gif","p":["Qi Jiang received the B.E. degree in industrial electrical automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1989 and 2008, respectively.

In this paper, an adaptive rate control (ARC) scheme with the aid of the receive buffer is presented for energy-efficient transmission of streaming media over CR with QoS guarantee. The QoS metric, either display smoothness or transmission delay, is quantified by the state of the receive buffer. Cross-layer information is utilized to form a closed-loop feedback optimal control. A novel analytical model called event-driven discrete-time Markov control process is introduced to formulate the QoS-guaranteed energy-efficient ARC problem. Based on potential theory, a policy iteration algorithm that combines potentials estimation and stochastic approximation is proposed for finding the optimal policy online. By exploiting the system dynamics, this algorithm does not depend on any prior knowledge of channel availability or fading statistics, and it can converge to the global optimum with a low computational cost and reasonable speed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677226","htmlLink":"/document/7312952/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Adaptive Rate Control for Streaming Media Transmission Over Cognitive Radio","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374158, 61233003, 61174186 and 61074033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Adaptive Rate Control for Streaming Media Transmission Over Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jiang-2496260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159439S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7312952","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312956,"authors":[{"name":"Wente Zeng","affiliation":["Advanced Diagnosis, Automation, and Control Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7851099/7312956/wzeng-2496228-small.gif","p":["Wente Zeng (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA, in 2013.","Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University.

The use of such algorithms provides flexibility, robustness, and scalability, while it also increases the vulnerability of smart grid to unexpected faults and adversaries. The potential consequences of compromising the power system can be devastating to public safety and economy. Thus, it is important to maintain the acceptable performance of distributed energy management algorithms in a smart grid environment under malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, a neighborhood-watch-based distributed energy management algorithm is proposed to guarantee the accurate control computation in solving the economic dispatch problem in the presence of compromised generation units. The proposed method achieves the system resilience by performing a reliable distributed control without a central coordinator and allowing all the well-behaving generation units to reach the optimal operating point asymptotically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies under several different adversary scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2496228","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2496228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7851099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7851099/07312956.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilient Distributed Energy Management Subject to Unexpected Misbehaving Generation Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312956/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resilient Distributed Energy Management Subject to Unexpected Misbehaving Generation Units","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7312956/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16668666","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000149","fundingName":"Division of Engineering Education and Centers","grantNumber":"0812121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilient Distributed Energy Management Subject to Unexpected Misbehaving Generation Units","sourcePdf":"tii-zeng-2496228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080288S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7851099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7851099","articleId":"7312956","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7312962,"authors":[{"name":"Gian Antonio Susto","affiliation":["University of Padova, Padova, Italy","Statwolf Ltd., Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7484223/7312962/susto-2496231-small.gif","p":["Gian Antonio Susto (S\u201911) received the M.S. degree (cum laude) in control systems engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Associate with the University of Padova, and Chief Data Scientist with Statwolf Ltd., Dublin, Ireland.

With the exponential growth in data logging in modern industries, such time series are increasingly available for statistical modeling in soft sensing applications. In order to exploit time-series data for predictive modeling, it is necessary to summarize the information they contain as a set of features to use as model regressors. Typically this is done in an unsupervised fashion using simple techniques such as computing statistical moments, principal components or wavelet decompositions, often leading to significant information loss, and hence suboptimal predictive models. In this paper, a functional learning paradigm is exploited in a supervised fashion to derive continuous smooth estimates of time-series data (yielding aggregated local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The proposed supervised aggregative feature extraction (SAFE) methodology can be extended to support nonlinear predictive models by embedding the functional learning framework in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) setting. SAFE has a number of attractive features including closed-form solution and the ability to explicitly incorporate first- and second-order derivative information. Using simulation studies and a practical semiconductor manufacturing case study, we highlight the strengths of the new methodology with respect to standard unsupervised feature extraction approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction for Big Data Time Series Regression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2496231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7484223/07312962.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2496231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction for Big Data Time Series Regression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7312962/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16070427","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction for Big Data Time Series Regression","sourcePdf":"tii-susto-2496231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071529S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7484223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7484223","articleId":"7312962","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7312971,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7398213/7312971/guwen-2496309-small.gif","p":["Guanghui Wen (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical systems and control from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2012.","Currently, he is a Lecturer with the Department of Mathematics, Research Center for Complex Systems and Network Sciences, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

Because of their many promising applications, they have attracted the attention of researchers from various fields. Recent research reveals that two perceptual color spaces (CIELab and CIELuv) provide useful information for expression recognition. This paper is an extended version of our International Conference on Pattern Recognition paper, in which we propose a novel color space model, tensor independent color space (TICS), to help recognize micro-expressions. In this paper, we further show that CIELab and CIELuv are also helpful in recognizing micro-expressions, and we indicate why these three color spaces achieve better performance. A micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e., a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture and independent color components achieves a higher accuracy than does that of RGB. In addition, we define a set of regions of interests (ROIs) based on the facial action coding system and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. Experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performances for TICS, CIELab, and CIELuv are better than those for RGB or gray.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2496314","startPage":"6034","endPage":"6047","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07312991.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2496314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro-Expression Recognition Using Color Spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Tensile stress","Color","Feature extraction","Face","Face recognition","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","face recognition","image colour analysis","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micro-expression recognition","involuntary facial expressions","genuine emotions","two perceptual color spaces","CIELab","CIELuv","novel color space model","tensor independent color space","TICS","micro-expression color video clip","fourth-order tensor","spatial information","temporal information","color information","RGB","independent color components","regions of interests","ROI","facial action coding system","dynamic texture histograms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Micro-expression recognition","Color Spaces","Tensor Analysis","Local Binary Patterns","Facial Action Coding System"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Color","Databases, Factual","Emotions","Face","Facial Expression","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]},{"kwd":["Micro-expression recognition","color spaces","tensor analysis","local binary patterns","facial action coding system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Micro-Expression Recognition Using Color Spaces","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7312991/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15580900","pubMedId":"26540689","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379095, 61332017, 61375009, 31500875 and 61472138"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4152055"},{"fundingName":"Open Projects Program of National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition","grantNumber":"201306295"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering through the Ministry of Education, Jilin University"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland and Infotech Oulu"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro-Expression Recognition Using Color Spaces","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2496314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108922S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7312991","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7312995,"authors":[{"name":"Yuval Domb","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Yuval Domb received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees from Tel Aviv University in 2003, 2006, and 2015, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

Interference management in the spatial domain through beamforming allows for increased reuse without having to sacrifice resources in the time or frequency domain. Existing beamforming techniques for spatial reuse, being coupled with client scheduling, face a key limitation in practical realization, especially with OFDMA small cells. In this context, we argue that for a practical spatial reuse system with beamforming, it is important to decouple beamforming from client scheduling. Further, we show that jointly addressing client association with beamforming is critical to maximizing the reuse potential of beamforming. Towards our goal, we propose ProBeam - a system for multi-cell beamforming and client association in OFDMA small cell networks. ProBeam incorporates two key components - a low complexity, highly accurate SINR estimation module that helps determine interference dependencies for beamforming between small cells; and an efficient, low complexity joint client association and beam selection algorithm for the small cells that accounts for scheduling at the small cells without being coupled with it. We have prototyped ProBeam on a WiMAX-based network of four small cells. Our evaluations reveal the accuracy of our SINR estimation module to be within 1 dB, and the reuse gains from joint client association and beamforming to be as high as 115 percent over baseline approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Multicell Beamforming and Client Association in OFDMA Small-Cell Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2496586","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7530934/07312996.pdf","startPage":"2260","endPage":"2274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2496586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7312996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Multicell Beamforming and Client Association in OFDMA Small-Cell Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7312996/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2016","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16224312","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea government","grantNumber":"2015R1C1A1A01051939"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Multicell Beamforming and Client Association in OFDMA Small-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-yoon-2496586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100368S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7312996","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7313000,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7313000/yao-small.gif","p":["Kai Yao was born in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1980.

A novel noninvasive online monitoring method of dc-link capacitor's ESR and C for boost power factor correction converter is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the capacitor voltage ripple which is composed of that of ESR and C, the calculation model is founded, which shows that instead of additional current sensor, only two values of capacitor voltage in particular moments within a line cycle need to be sampled for the calculation of ESR and C. The schematic of the monitoring system together with the design considerations of the trigger circuit, the isolated voltage amplifier, and the isolated current amplifier, is described in detail. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2496267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7423826/07313000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2496267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423826","startPage":"5944","endPage":"5951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Online Monitoring Scheme of DC-Link Capacitor's ESR and C for a Boost PFC Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Online Monitoring Scheme of DC-Link Capacitor's ESR and C for a Boost PFC Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"15823155","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7313000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51307085"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012M521087"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"1202068C"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Joint Innovation Fund of Industry, Education, and Research-Prospective Joint Research Project","grantNumber":"BY2013004-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Monitoring Scheme of DC-Link Capacitor's ESR and C for a Boost PFC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-yao-2496267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086004S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7313000","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7313005,"authors":[{"name":"Junyeong Seo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7394983/7313005/7313005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junyeong Seo (S\u201911) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.","He is currently with the wireless information systems research group, KAIST, working towards the Ph.D. degree.

By exploiting the sparsity in large mmWave MIMO channels and imposing a Markovian random walk assumption on the movement of the receiver and reflection clusters, the adaptive training beam sequence design and channel estimation problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem that finds non-zero bins in a two-dimensional grid. Under the proposed POMDP framework, optimal and suboptimal adaptive training beam sequence design policies are derived. Furthermore, a very fast suboptimal greedy algorithm is developed based on a newly proposed reduced sufficient statistic to make the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm low to a level for practical implementation. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed training beam design method. Numerical results show that the proposed training beam sequence design algorithms yield good performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7394983/07313005.pdf","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2496241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2496241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Beam Sequence Design for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems: A POMDP Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","MIMO","Receivers","Transmitters","Algorithm design and analysis","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","greedy algorithms","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave MIMO systems","POMDP framework","adaptive training beam sequence design","millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output channels","Markovian random walk assumption","receiver","reflection clusters","channel estimation problem","partially observable Markov decision process","greedy algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","Millimeter wave","MIMO","POMDP","training signal design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Training Beam Sequence Design for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems: A POMDP Framework","volume":"64","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7313005/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15754916","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Beam Sequence Design for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems: A POMDP Framework","sourcePdf":"tsp-sung-2496241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113396S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7394983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7394983","articleId":"7313005","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7313006,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292503700"},{"name":"Jyun-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyun-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"38666591500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7313006","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":581},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate power-allocation and relay-selection algorithms for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative relay systems under imperfect channel estimation.

Its real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection and segmentation problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions. The ER detector is robust against blur, low contrast and illumination, color and texture variation. In the first stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using features calculated by a novel algorithm in constant time and only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification accuracy is improved using computationally more expensive features. A highly efficient clustering algorithm then groups ERs into text lines and an OCR classifier trained on synthetic fonts is exploited to label character regions. The most probable character sequence is selected in the last stage when the context of each character is known. The method was evaluated on three public datasets. On the ICDAR 2013 dataset the method achieves state-of-the-art results in text localization; on the more challenging SVT dataset, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that the proposed pipeline can incorporate additional prior knowledge about the detected text. The proposed method was exploited as the baseline in the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading competition, where it compares favourably to the state-of-the art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16191140","pubMedId":"26540676","volume":"38","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7313008/","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Lexicon-Free Scene Text Localization and Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"Czech Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"GACR","grantNumber":"P103/12/G084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Lexicon-Free Scene Text Localization and Recognition","sourcePdf":"tpami-neumann-2496234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192833S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7313008","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7313016,"authors":[{"name":"Heecheol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wireless Signal Processing Lab., Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7394983/7313016/7313016-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heecheol Yang (S\u201915) was born in Ulsan, Korea.

In existing BIA, the coherence time of channel is assumed to be long enough, but that may not always be true in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a dynamic supersymbol design method which can construct a supersymbol with limited symbol extension that is determined by the coherence time of channel. It is demonstrated that the supersymbol block length can be reduced significantly by aligning interferences in a hierarchical manner, referred to as hierarchical BIA. The key idea of hierarchical BIA is to align interferences in groups and to use the same supersymbol structure between groups, producing aligned inter-group interferences without inner-group interference. Consequently, it is observed that with a given coherence time the proposed dynamic supersymbol design that exploits hierarchical BIA achieves higher degrees of freedom than the conventional method.","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7394983/07313016.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2496282","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2496282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Transmitters","Coherence","Antennas","Switches","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical blind interference alignment","interference networks","finite coherence time","staggered antenna switching","broadcast channel","interference channel","cellular networks","dynamic supersymbol design method","limited symbol extension","supersymbol block length","hierarchical BIA","supersymbol structure","inter-group interferences","degrees of freedom"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind interference alignment (BIA)","coherence time","degrees of freedom (Dof)","reconfigurable antenna","supersymbol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Blind Interference Alignment Over Interference Networks With Finite Coherence Time","accessionNumber":"15754917","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2016","publicationDate":"March1, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7313016/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MEST Bio-Mimetic Robot Research Center funded by Defense Acquisition Program Administration","grantNumber":"UD130070ID"},{"fundingName":"INMAC"},{"fundingName":"BK21-plus"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Blind Interference Alignment Over Interference Networks With Finite Coherence Time","sourcePdf":"tsp-lee-2496282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083095S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7394983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7394983","articleId":"7313016","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7313018,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanxin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7394983/7313018/7313018-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanxin Li received the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013 and the B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2010.

One example is the spectrally-sparse signal, which is composed of a small number of spectral atoms with arbitrary frequencies on the unit interval. In this paper we study the problem of line spectrum denoising and estimation with an ensemble of spectrally-sparse signals composed of the same set of continuous-valued frequencies from their partial and noisy observations. Two approaches are developed based on atomic norm minimization and structured covariance estimation, both of which can be solved efficiently via semidefinite programming. The first approach aims to estimate and denoise the set of signals from their partial and noisy observations via atomic norm minimization, and recover the frequencies via examining the dual polynomial of the convex program. We characterize the optimality condition of the proposed algorithm and derive the expected error rate for denoising, demonstrating the benefit of including multiple measurement vectors. The second approach aims to recover the population covariance matrix from the partially observed sample covariance matrix by motivating its low-rank Toeplitz structure without recovering the signal ensemble. Performance guarantee is derived with a finite number of measurement vectors. The frequencies can be recovered via conventional spectrum estimation methods such as MUSIC from the estimated covariance matrix. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the favorable performance of the proposed algorithms, with comparisons against several existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2496294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7394983/07313018.pdf","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2496294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-the-Grid Line Spectrum Denoising and Estimation With Multiple Measurement Vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313018/","displayDocTitle":"Off-the-Grid Line Spectrum Denoising and Estimation With Multiple Measurement Vectors","volume":"64","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15773439","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313018/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF-1422966"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-1-0205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2387"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-the-Grid Line Spectrum Denoising and Estimation With Multiple Measurement Vectors","sourcePdf":"tsp-chi-2496294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08352S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7394983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"7394983","articleId":"7313018","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7313022,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7590229/7313022/wang-2492941-small.gif","p":["Ding Wang (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in operations research and cybernetics from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2012.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The neural network identification scheme is combined with the traditional adaptive critic technique, in order to design the nonlinear robust optimal control under uncertain environment. First, the robust optimal controller of the original uncertain system with a specified cost function is established by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. Then, a neural network identifier is employed to reconstruct the unknown dynamics of the nominal system with stability analysis. Hence, the data-based adaptive critic designs can be developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the transformed optimal control problem. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is also proved by using the Lyapunov approach. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2492941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2015.2492941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7590229/07313022.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Based Adaptive Critic Designs for Nonlinear Robust Optimal Control With Uncertain Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Data-Based Adaptive Critic Designs for Nonlinear Robust Optimal Control With Uncertain Dynamics","volume":"46","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313022/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378809","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313022/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233001, 61273136, 61273140, 61304086, 61374105, 61533017 and 61573353"},{"fundingName":"Early Career Development Award of the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Based Adaptive Critic Designs for Nonlinear Robust Optimal Control With Uncertain Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tsmc-liu-2492941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144445S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7590229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"7590229","articleId":"7313022","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7313024,"authors":[{"name":"Junbo Zhao","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Northern Virginia Center, Falls Church, VA, USA","School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Junbo Zhao (S\u201913) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, and the Bradley Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA.","His research interests are in the theoretical and algorithmic studies in power system state estimation, power system operation and dynamics, robust statistics, and signal processing."]},"firstName":"Junbo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085368574"},{"name":"Gexiang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Gexiang Zhang (M\u201903) received the Ph.D. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2005.

First, this paper extends the approximate dc model to a more general linear model that can handle both supervisory control and data acquisition and phasor measurement unit measurements. Then, a general FDIA based on this model is derived and the error tolerance of such attacks is discussed. To detect such attacks, a method based on short-term state forecasting considering temporal correlation is proposed. Furthermore, a statistics-based measurement consistency test method is presented to check the consistency between the forecasted measurements and the received measurements. This measurement consistency test is further integrated with \u221e-norm and L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-norm-based measurement residual analysis to construct the proposed detection metric. The proposed detector addresses the shortcoming of previous detectors in terms of handling critical measurements. Besides, the removal problem of attacked measurements, which may cause the system to become unobservable, is addressed effectively by the proposed method through forecasted measurements. Numerical tests on IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7953698/07313024.pdf","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2492827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2492827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term State Forecasting-Aided Method for Detection of Smart Grid General False Data Injection Attacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Phasor measurement units","Forecasting","Computer hacking","Pollution measurement","Current measurement","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","numerical analysis","phasor measurement","smart power grids","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term state forecasting-aided method","smart grid general false data injection attack detection","FDIA","power grid security","power grid control","supervisory control and data acquisition","phasor measurement unit measurement","statistics-based measurement consistency test method","L2-norm-based measurement residual analysis","\u221e-norm based measurement residual analysis","numerical testing","IEEE 118-bus test system","IEEE 14-bus test system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["False data injection attack","state estimation","cyber security","smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term State Forecasting-Aided Method for Detection of Smart Grid General False Data Injection Attacks","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7313024/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969852","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170016 and 61373047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201407000013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term State Forecasting-Aided Method for Detection of Smart Grid General False Data Injection Attacks","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhao-2492827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070594S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7953698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7953698","articleId":"7313024","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7313026,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Cao","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","TU Dresden, Chair of Communications Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38469398300"},{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["TU Dresden, Chair of Communications Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Zappone","id":"37399768400"},{"name":"Eduard A.

This paper proposes a grouping-based interference alignment (GIA) with optimized IA-Cell assignment for the multiple cells interfering multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC) network under limited feedback. This work consists of three main parts: 1) an improved version (including some new improvements) of the GIA with respect to the degrees of freedom (DoF) and optimal linear transceiver design is provided, which allows for low-complexity and distributed implementation; 2) based on the GIA, the concept of IA-Cell assignment is introduced. Three IA-Cell assignment algorithms are proposed with different backhaul overhead and their DoF and rate performance is investigated; 3)the performance of the proposed GIA algorithms is studied under limited feedback of IA precoders. To enable efficient feedback, a dynamic feedback bit allocation (DBA) problem is formulated and solved in closed-form. The practical implementation, the backhaul overhead requirements, and the complexity of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms greatly outperform the traditional GIA under both unlimited and limited feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouping-Based Interference Alignment With IA-Cell Assignment in Multi-Cell MIMO MAC Under Limited Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2496356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7394983/07313026.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2496356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Grouping-Based Interference Alignment With IA-Cell Assignment in Multi-Cell MIMO MAC Under Limited Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2016","publicationDate":"March1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15754915","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouping-Based Interference Alignment With IA-Cell Assignment in Multi-Cell MIMO MAC Under Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-cao-2496356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086697S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","isNumber":"7394983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"7313026","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7313027,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjiang Lei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optoelectronics Technology and System, Ministry of Education, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiang","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0002-9070-6300","id":"38238073300"},{"name":"Chao Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology and Systems of Education Ministry of China, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Gao","id":"38235857000"},{"name":"Imran Shafique Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Imran Shafique","lastName":"Ansari","orcid":"0000-0001-8461-6547","id":"37679657400"},{"name":"Yongcai Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology and Systems of Education Ministry of China, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yongcai","lastName":"Guo","id":"37833272800"},{"name":"Gaofeng Pan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Pan","id":"37600445100"},{"name":"Khalid A.

It consists of an array of 9 \u00d7 12 piezoelectric elements mounted on the ASIC via an integration scheme that involves direct electrical connections between a bond-pad array on the ASIC and the transducer elements. The ASIC addresses the critical challenge of reducing cable count, and includes front-end amplifiers with adjustable gains and microbeamformer circuits that locally process and combine echo signals received by the elements of each 3 \u00d7 3 subarray. Thus, an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of receive channels is achieved. Dedicated circuit techniques are employed to meet the strict space and power constraints of TEE probes. The ASIC has been fabricated in a standard 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process and consumes only 0.44 mW/channel. The prototype has been acoustically characterized in a water tank. The ASIC allows the array to be presteered across \u00b137\u00b0 while achieving an overall dynamic range of 77 dB. Both the measured characteristics of the individual transducer elements and the performance of the ASIC are in good agreement with expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7368974/07313028.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Prototype PZT Matrix Transducer With Low-Power Integrated Receive ASIC for 3-D Transesophageal Echocardiography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Transducers","Probes","Arrays","Three-dimensional displays","Delays","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","CMOS integrated circuits","echocardiography","piezoelectric transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS process","dedicated circuit technique","receive channel","microbeamformer circuit","front-end amplifier","bond-pad array","direct electrical connection","piezoelectric element","transesophageal echocardiography probe","lead zirconium titanate matrix transducer","3D transesophageal echocardiography","low-power integrated receive ASIC","prototype PZT matrix transducer"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional","Echocardiography, Transesophageal","Equipment Design","Lead","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Titanium","Transducers","Zirconium"]},{"kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","interconnection techniques","matrix transducer arrays","micro-beamforming","transesophageal echocardiography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Prototype PZT Matrix Transducer With Low-Power Integrated Receive ASIC for 3-D Transesophageal Echocardiography","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7313028/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685127","pubMedId":"26540683","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003958","fundingName":"Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004725","fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prototype PZT Matrix Transducer With Low-Power Integrated Receive ASIC for 3-D Transesophageal Echocardiography","sourcePdf":"tuffc-chen-2496580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7368974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7368974","articleId":"7313028","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7313031,"authors":[{"name":"Yannick Meier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7313031/7313031-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yannick Meier received the B.Sc. degree in information technology and electrical engineering from ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) in 2014.","In 2014 and 2015 he conducted research visits at University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA and at University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

One important problem is to automatically detect students that are going to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial actions. Existing grade prediction systems focus on maximizing the accuracy of the prediction while overseeing the importance of issuing timely and personalized predictions. This paper proposes an algorithm that predicts the final grade of each student in a class. It issues a prediction for each student individually, when the expected accuracy of the prediction is sufficient. The algorithm learns online what is the optimal prediction and time to issue a prediction based on past history of students' performance in a course. We derive a confidence estimate for the prediction accuracy and demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a dataset obtained based on the performance of approximately 700 UCLA undergraduate students who have taken an introductory digital signal processing over the past seven years. We demonstrate that for 85% of the students we can predict with 76% accuracy whether they are going do well or poorly in the class after the fourth course week. Using data obtained from a pilot course, our methodology suggests that it is effective to perform early in-class assessments such as quizzes, which result in timely performance prediction for each student, thereby enabling timely interventions by the instructor (at the student or class level) when necessary.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15719690","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7313031/","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predicting Grades","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Grades","sourcePdf":"tsp-meier-2496278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078523S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7313031","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7313032,"authors":[{"name":"Jungsuk Kwac","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Stanford Sustainable Systems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7548088/7313032/kwac-2480841-small.gif","p":["Jungsuk Kwac (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; the M.S. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2012; and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, in 2014, both in electrical engineering.","He is with the Stanford Sustainable Systems Laboratory, Stanford University.

The channel is modeled as a twin-user interference channel constituted by the primary user (PU) and the SU. The achievable rate of the SU is derived based on the inner bound formulated by Han and Kobayashi, where the PU achieves the maximum attainable rate of the single-user point-to-point link. We show that it is necessary for the SU to allocate its full power for the \u201cpublic\u201d message that can be decoded both by the SU and by the PU. We also demonstrate that it is optimal for the PU to allocate its full power for the \u201cprivate\u201d message that can only be decoded by the PU if the level of interference imposed by the PU on the SU is \u201cergodically strong.\u201d Similarly, it is optimal for the PU to allocate its full power for the public message that can be decoded both by the SU and PU if this interference is \u201cergodically weak.\u201d These findings suggest that this power allocation is independent of the level of interference imposed by the SU on the PU. Furthermore, the achievable rate is analyzed as a function of the average level of interference. An interesting observation is that if the level of interference imposed by the SU on the PU is \u201cergodically weak,\u201d the achievable rate becomes a monotonically increasing function of this interference, and it is independent of the level of interference imposed by the PU on the SU. Furthermore, we analyze the realistic imperfect channel estimation scenario and demonstrate that the channel estimation errors will not affect the optimal nature of the SU's power allocation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16306017","htmlLink":"/document/7313034/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rates of Underlay-Based Cognitive Radio Operating Under Rate Limitation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"India\u2013U.K. Advanced Technology Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks Systems and Services"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Rates of Underlay-Based Cognitive Radio Operating Under Rate Limitation","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2496277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11899S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7313034","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7313035,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Schloemann","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Department of ECE, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7313035/schlo-2496273-small.gif","p":["Javier Schloemann (S\u201906\u2013M\u201907) received the B.S. degree (with Hons.) in computer engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in 2004, 2007, and 2015, respectively.

Due to random variations in the channel conditions to its surrounding base stations (BS), the mobile device is likely to face a mix of both favorable and unfavorable geometries for localization. Analytical studies of localization performance (e.g., using the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound) usually require that one fix the BS geometry, and favorable geometries have always been the preferred choice in the literature. However, not only are the resulting analytical results constrained to the selected geometry, this practice is likely to lead to overly-optimistic expectations of typical localization performance. Ideally, localization performance should be studied across all possible geometric setups, thereby also removing any selection bias. This, however, is known to be hard and has been carried out only in simulation. In this paper, we develop a new tractable approach where we endow the BS locations with a distribution by modeling them as a Poisson point process (PPP), and use tools from stochastic geometry to obtain easy-to-use expressions for key performance metrics. In particular, we focus on the probability of detecting some minimum number of BSs, which is shown to be closely coupled with a network operator's ability to obtain satisfactory localization performance (e.g., meet FCC E911 requirements). This metric is indifferent to the localization technique (e.g., TOA, TDOA, AOA, or hybrids thereof), though different techniques will presumably lead to different BS hearability requirements. In order to mitigate excessive interference due to the presence of dominant interferers in the form of other BSs, we incorporate both BS coordination and frequency reuse in the proposed framework and quantify the resulting performance gains analytically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313035/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837511","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Tractable Analysis of Localization Fundamentals in Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Tractable Analysis of Localization Fundamentals in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-dhillon-2496273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119598S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7313035","onlineDate":"30 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7313036,"authors":[{"name":"\u0141ukasz Farian","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Blindern, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7337496/7313036/7313036-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u0141ukasz Farian (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in automation and robotics from Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland, and the M.Sc. degree in nanoelectronics and robotics from the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.","In 2013, he worked as a Summer Analog Designer Intern at OmniVision Technologies, Oslo, Norway.

The in-pixel color processing is inspired by the retinal color opponency that are found in mammalian retinas. Color transitions in a pixel are represented by voltage spikes, which are akin to a neuron's action potential. These spikes are conveyed off-chip by the Address Event Representation (AER) protocol. To achieve sensitivity to three different color spectra within the visual spectrum, each pixel has three stacked photodiodes at different depths in the silicon substrate. The sensor has been fabricated in the standard TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. A post-processing method to decode events into color transitions has been proposed and implemented as a custom interface to display real-time color changes in the visual scene. Experimental results are provided. Color transitions can be detected at high speed (up to 2.7 kHz). The sensor has a dynamic range of 58 dB and a power consumption of 22.5 mW.

The confidential secrecy rates are nonconvex functions of transmit covariance matrices, which makes it intractable to find optimal transmit covariance matrices analytically. In the MIMO broadcast channels, we prove the weighted secrecy sum rate maximization has zero duality gap and KKT conditions are necessary conditions for the optimal solution. We apply the block successive lower-bound maximization technique to nonconvex weighted secrecy sum rate maximization problems. We also derive numerical algorithms for MIMO interference channels and Gaussian wiretap channels with a cooperative jammer. Every limit point achieved by the proposed algorithms is a local optimal solution that satisfies the KKT conditions. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing suboptimal algorithms in terms of secrecy rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Sum Rate Maximization of MIMO

We formulate an optimization problem that combines these pairwise plans into an overall plan for a large number of trucks. The problem resembles a medoids clustering problem.

In order to convert multiple LRF data into a unified coordinate system, we have to obtain the rigid transformation among multi-LRF. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for online extrinsic calibration of multi-LRFs by observing a planar checkerboard pattern and solving for transformation between the views of a planar checkerboard from a camera and multi-LRF. Existing LRF calibration is achieved by freely moving a checkerboard pattern and conducting much offline optimization. Compared with traditional algorithm, the advantages of our approach are twofold. Firstly, adopting the noise of images and LRF depth readings, we can exactly calculate the exact position and pose of the checkerboard that can largely reduce the transformation error. Secondly, the complete calibration process is online, which means the exact position and pose of the checkerboard can be obtained in real-time and manipulated by robotic arm. In the end, our calibration approach is validated through real experiments that show the superiority with respect to the state-of-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.136","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313228.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Active Calibration for a Multi-LRF System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Active Calibration for a Multi-LRF System","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583132","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Active Calibration for a Multi-LRF System","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596a806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072919S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7313234,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Guidotti","affiliation":["IBM Research, Ireland","Dept. of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Guidotti","id":"37085468693"},{"name":"Andrea Sassi","affiliation":["IBM Research, Ireland","Dept. of Engineering Sciences and Methods, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sassi","id":"37072368700"},{"name":"Michele Berlingerio","affiliation":["IBM Res., Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Berlingerio","id":"37394418200"},{"name":"Alessandra Pascale","affiliation":["IBM Research, Ireland"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Pascale","id":"37949445000"},{"name":"Bissan Ghaddar","affiliation":["IBM Research, Ireland"],"firstName":"Bissan","lastName":"Ghaddar","id":"38274040600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313234","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"abstract":"Carpooling, i.e. the sharing of vehicles to reach common destinations, is often performed to reduce costs and pollution. Recent works on carpooling and journey planning take into account, besides mobility match, also social aspects and, more generally, non-monetary rewards. In line with this, we present a data-driven methodology for a more enjoyable carpooling. We introduce a measure of enjoyability based on people's interests, social links, and tendency to connect to people with similar or dissimilar interests. We devise a methodology to compute enjoyability from crowd-sourced data, and we show how this can be used on real world datasets to optimize for both mobility and enjoyability. Our methodology was tested on real data from Rome and San Francisco. We compare the results of an optimization model minimizing the number of cars, and a greedy approach maximing the enjoyability. We evaluate them in terms of cars saved, and average enjoyability of the system. We present also the results of a user study, with more than 200 users reporting an interest of 39% in the enjoyable solution. Moreoever, 24% of people declared that sharing the car with interesting people would be the primary motivation for carpooling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automobiles","Trajectory","Optimization","Twitter","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","greedy algorithms","intelligent transportation systems","optimisation","outsourcing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy approach","optimization model","data crowdsourcing","journey planning","carpooling","data-driven approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.142","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313234.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social or Green?

It is crucial to have this information as early as possible, given the typical reaction time of human drivers. Since this is a highly complex problem, it needs to be addressed in small portions. In this paper we will focus on the behavior of pedestrians at crosswalks. We use a database of real pedestrian trajectories to learn a model which is able to predict if a pedestrian will cross the street. Therefore, we first introduce a large set of possible features that could be suitable to describe the behavior. Afterwards, we perform relevance determination to identify those features that are necessary to reach the best possible generalisation performance. We provide experimental results on data collected at a pedestrian crossing in a city in southern Germany. Our results shows, that a very sparse set of features, which depends only on the pedestrians' trajectory, gives the best result.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313236/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313236/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572649","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Feature Relevance Estimation for Learning Pedestrian Behavior at Crosswalks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Relevance Estimation for Learning Pedestrian Behavior at Crosswalks","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596a854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061086S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7313256,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Ulbrich","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Ulbrich","id":"37085645711"},{"name":"Till Menzel","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Till","lastName":"Menzel","id":"37085674287"},{"name":"Andreas Reschka","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Reschka","id":"38230560200"},{"name":"Fabian Schuldt","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Schuldt","id":"38469405400"},{"name":"Markus Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37351800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313256","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":128,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3335},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313256","abstract":"For the design and test of functional modules of an automated vehicle, it is essential to define interfaces. While interfaces on the perception side, like object lists, point clouds or occupancy grids, are to a certain degree settled already, they are quite vague in the consecutive steps of context modeling and in particular on the side of driving execution. The authors consider the scene as the central interface between perception and behavior planning & control. Within the behavior planning & control block, a situation is a central data container. A scenario is a common approach to substantiate test cases for functional modules and can be used to detail the functional description of a system. However, definitions of these terms are often-at best-vague or even contradictory. This paper will review these definitions and come up with a consistent definition for each term. Moreover, we present an example for the implementation of each of these interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.164","startPage":"982","endPage":"988","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313256.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defining and Substantiating the Terms Scene, Situation, and Scenario for Automated Driving","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Observers","Context modeling","Planning","Vehicle dynamics","Roads","Systems architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation systems","road vehicles","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated driving","functional module","automated vehicle","perception side","point cloud","occupancy grid","context modeling","driving execution","central interface","behavior planning","control block","central data container","functional description"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Defining and Substantiating the Terms Scene, Situation, and Scenario for Automated Driving","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313256/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572749","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defining and Substantiating the Terms Scene, Situation, and Scenario for Automated Driving","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596a982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049951S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":7313257,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Ulbrich","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Ulbrich","id":"37085645711"},{"name":"Markus Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37351800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313257","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Vehicles","Predictive models","Context modeling","Decision making","Uncertainty","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","integer programming","intelligent transportation systems","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactical lane change behavior planning","automated vehicles","automated driving","drivers assistance","lane driving automation","tactical maneuvers","lane changes","perception uncertainties","prediction-based behavior planning","high-dimensional mixed-integer state spaces","real traffic","Audi A7 piloted driving concept vehicle","Consumer Electronics Show","CES"]}],"abstract":"Recently, automated driving has more and more been transformed from an exciting vision into hands on reality by prototypes.

In this paper, we present our approach for tactical behavior planning for lane changes. We present a way to tackle perception uncertainties and how to achieve provident, prediction-based behavior planning. For this, we introduce a novel framework to plan in high-dimensional, mixed-integer state spaces in real-time. Our approach is evaluated not only in simulation, but also in real traffic.

Within different technologies, Wavelet OFDM has been recommended as medium access technique for broadband power line communications (PLCs). In IEEE 1901, the wavelet OFDM physical layer (PHY) defines a transmitter based on cosine-modulated filter bank (CMFB), for which due to the power line channel features, a receiver with an efficient equalizer is needed. In this work, we obtain the value of the coefficients of an equalizer integrated in an Adaptive Sine-Modulated/Cosine-Modulated Filter Bank Equalizer for Transmultiplexers (ASCET), which could be used to compensate for the power line channel effects. Our proposal focuses on the two-order system, analyzing the frequency points to be sampled and deriving the theoretical expression to obtain its coefficients. With the aim of evaluating the performance of this equalizer, a comparison between 2-ASCET and lower-order ASCET, (0-ASCET and 1-ASCET) is carried out considering in-home and in-vehicle scenarios. This study is completed with several computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.222","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-ASCET for Broadband Multicarrier Transmission over In-home and In-vehicle Power Line Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"2-ASCET for Broadband Multicarrier Transmission over In-home and In-vehicle Power Line Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572535","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7313314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-ASCET for Broadband Multicarrier Transmission over In-home and In-vehicle Power Line Networks","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596b351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109878S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313414,"authors":[{"name":"Carl Bergenhem","affiliation":["Qamcom Research and Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Bergenhem","id":"37326449300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313414","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Protocols","Computer aided manufacturing","Delays","Brakes","Security","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation systems","protocols","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle platoon","ITS facilities layer protocols","intelligent transportation systems","CAM protocol","DENM protocol","Minimal protocol","brake actuation","hard brake manoeuvre"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ETSI TC ITS","Platooning","Facilities Layer Protocol","CACC","Update rate","Cooperative Application","V2V Communication"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes three approaches for facilities layer protocols for platooning. These imply sharing information within a platoon of vehicles based on communication standards developed within ETSI TC ITS. Two novel ITS facilities layer protocols for platooning are proposed: Minimal and Full Platooning protocols. Standardising such protocols enable vehicles from different OEMs to have a common communication strategy for platooning. The proposed protocols are compared with the current facilities layer protocols: CAM and DENM. Deficiencies of these with respect to platooning are discussed. A discussion on message update rate is also given. Results from a demonstration of platooning with the Minimal protocol compared to CAM/DENM are presented. It is shown that the Minimal protocol gave a lower latency of brake actuation during a hard brake manoeuvre.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaches for Facilities Layer Protocols for Platooning","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.322","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313414.pdf","startPage":"1989","endPage":"1994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Approaches for Facilities Layer Protocols for Platooning","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313414/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572584","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches for Facilities Layer Protocols for Platooning","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596b989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059286S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313434,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, Hunan Prov., China"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085618648"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37087707542"},{"name":"Xiangjing An","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjing","lastName":"An","id":"37085408852"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313434","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Vegetation","Radio frequency","Wires","Semantics","Feature extraction","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural scenes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scene semantic labeling approach","3D scenes","complex topological structure","point descriptor extraction","Voxel-neighbor structure","random forest","conditional random fields","energy function","graph cut","Oakland 3D point cloud dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRF","Random Forest","3D Point Cloud","Semantic labeling"]}],"abstract":"Using point cloud to label objects of different categories in 3D scenes is a hard task because of their complex topological structure.

An advanced control strategy is developed which only demands the axles of the converter dolly of such vehicle to be actively steerable so that existing tractor and semitrailers can be used without any further modification. The control strategy described in this paper allows the change of forward speed and even to stop the vehicle completely during the turning maneuver without any performance degradation. The controller utilizes the delays of tractor front axle steering angle and the articulation angles measured not in traditional time but in path-distance domain. The optimal controller is achieved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Finally the optimal vehicle performance is compared with a baseline non-steerable converter dolly case and also with a proportional control case. Significant improvement in path-following performance is observed.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.383","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313475.pdf","startPage":"2370","endPage":"2377","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improve Safety by Optimal Steering Control of a Converter Dolly Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Low-Speed Maneuvers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improve Safety by Optimal Steering Control of a Converter Dolly Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Low-Speed Maneuvers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15572823","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7313475/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improve Safety by Optimal Steering Control of a Converter Dolly Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Low-Speed Maneuvers","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596c370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090152S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7313492,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Rummelhard","affiliation":["Inria Grenoble-Rhone-Alpes"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Rummelhard","id":"37085652582"},{"name":"Amaury N\u00e8gre","affiliation":["CNRS, Grenoble Informatics Laboratory","Inria Grenoble-Rhone-Alpes"],"firstName":"Amaury","lastName":"N\u00e8gre","id":"37681775300"},{"name":"Christian Laugier","affiliation":["Inria Grenoble-Rhone-Alpes"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Laugier","id":"37273327000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313492","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":330},"abstract":"Proper modeling of dynamic environments is a core task in the field of intelligent vehicles. The most common approaches involve the modeling of moving objects, through Detection And Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) methods. An alternative to a classic object model framework is the occupancy grid filtering domain. Instead of segmenting the scene into objects and track them, the environment is represented as a regular grid of occupancy, in which spatial occupancy is tracked at a sub-object level. In this paper, we present the Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker, a generic spatial occupancy tracker, which infers dynamics of the scene through an hybrid representation of the environment, consisting of static occupancy, dynamic occupancy, empty spaces and unknown areas. This differentiation enables the use of state specific models (classic occupancy grid for motion-less components, set of moving particles for dynamic occupancy) as well as proper confidence estimation and management of data-less areas. The approach leads to a compact model that drastically improves the accuracy of the results and the global efficiency in comparison to previous methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Bayes methods","Dynamics","Estimation","Mathematical model","Robot sensing systems","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image filtering","image motion analysis","image segmentation","mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conditional Monte Carlo dense occupancy tracker","dynamic environment modeling","intelligent vehicles","moving object modeling","moving object detection","moving object tracking","DATMO method","occupancy grid filtering domain","scene segmentation","environment representation","regular occupancy grid","subobject level spatial occupancy tracking","scene dynamics inference","dynamic occupancy","empty spaces","unknown areas","state specific model","motion-less components","moving particles","confidence estimation","data-less area management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.400","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313492.pdf","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313492/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313492/","accessionNumber":"15572775","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596c485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058819S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7313503,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Koller","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Koller","id":"37304055500"},{"name":"Peter Widhalm","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Widhalm","id":"37946088200"},{"name":"Melitta Dragaschnig","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna"],"firstName":"Melitta","lastName":"Dragaschnig","id":"37589904800"},{"name":"Anita Graser","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna"],"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Graser","id":"38491471000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313503","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"abstract":"The problem of map-matching sparse and noisy GPS trajectories to road networks has gained increasing importance in recent years. A common state-of-the-art solution to this problem relies on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify the most plausible road sequence for a given trajectory. While this approach has been shown to work well on sparse and noisy data, the algorithm has a high computational complexity and becomes slow when working with large trajectories and extended search radii. We propose an optimization to the original approach which significantly reduces the number of state transitions that need to be evaluated in order to identify the correct solution. In experiments with publicly available benchmark data, the proposed optimization yields nearly identical map-matching results as the original algorithm, but reduces the algorithm runtime by up to 45%. We demonstrate that the effects of our optimization become more pronounced when dealing with larger problem spaces and indicate how our approach can be combined with other recent optimizations to further reduce the overall algorithm runtime.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313503.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2561","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Hidden Markov Model Map-Matching for Sparse and Noisy Trajectories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Roads","Routing","Trajectory","Hidden Markov models","Optimization","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Hidden Markov Model map matching","noisy trajectories","sparse trajectories","noisy GPS trajectories","road networks","HMM","plausible road sequence","noisy data","sparse data","computational complexity","extended search radii","state transitions","identical map-matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Analysis","GPS Processing","Map-Matching","Hidden Markov Model","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast Hidden Markov Model Map-Matching for Sparse and Noisy Trajectories","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572734","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Hidden Markov Model Map-Matching for Sparse and Noisy Trajectories","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596c557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067545S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313512,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Styler","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Styler","id":"37946085500"},{"name":"Andreas Sauer","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Sauer","id":"37088046086"},{"name":"Illah Nourbakhsh","affiliation":["BMW Group, Research and Technology"],"firstName":"Illah","lastName":"Nourbakhsh","id":"37283197400"},{"name":"Hermann Rottengruber","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Systems (IMS), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Rottengruber","id":"37085662970"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6596-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"}],"articleNumber":"7313512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Optimization","Batteries","Global Positioning System","Fuels","Mathematical model","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","fuel economy","hybrid electric vehicles","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimal control","optimisation","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learned optimal control","range extender","batteries","gasoline","vehicle efficiency","vehicle longevity","vehicle performance","energy management optimization","cheap sensing","on-board learning","optimization","data-driven controller","series gas-electric hybrid vehicle","direct programmatic control","fuel savings","noise-cost reduction"]}],"abstract":"Each year, hybrid vehicles command a larger portion of total vehicles on the road. These vehicles combine multiple sources of energy, such as batteries and gasoline, which have different strengths and weaknesses. Active management of these energy sources can increase vehicle efficiency, longevity, or performance. Optimizing energy management is highly sensitive to upcoming power loads on the vehicle, but conventional control policies only react to the present state. Furthermore, these policies are computed at design-time and do not adapt to individual drivers. Advancements in cheap sensing and computation have enabled on-board learning and optimization that was previously impossible. In this work, we developed and implemented a real-time controller that exploits predictions computed from a dataset collected from other drivers. This data-driven controller manages a range-extender in a series gas-electric hybrid vehicle, optimizing fuel use, noise, and ignition frequency. The algorithm is scalable to large amounts of source data, and performance improves with prediction accuracy. We tested the algorithm in simulation and on a modified vehicle with direct programmatic control of the range extender. The experimental results on the vehicle reflected those observed in simulation, achieving fuel savings up to 12% and a noise-cost reduction of 73%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2015.420","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307301/7312804/07313512.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2618","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2015.420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learned Optimal Control of a Range Extender in a Series Hybrid Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learned Optimal Control of a Range Extender in a Series Hybrid Vehicle","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7313512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572941","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned Optimal Control of a Range Extender in a Series Hybrid Vehicle","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"6596c612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067555S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307301","isNumber":"7312804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307301","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7312804","articleId":"7313512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7313566,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Das","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego La Jolla, California"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Das","id":"37085750118"},{"name":"Eshed Ohn-Bar","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego La Jolla, California"],"firstName":"Eshed","lastName":"Ohn-Bar","id":"37073869900"},{"name":"Mohan M.

The code rates between BS and RS in the proposed schemes are 1, 4/5, 2/3 and 4/7, while in the scheme with virtual OSTBC the code rate is only 1/2.

Moreover, with 64-QAM a maximum gain of 4.5 dB in Eb/No is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313674","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of IEEE 802.11n LDPC codes with modified reliability based hybrid ARQ and Unequal Error Protection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313674/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of IEEE 802.11n LDPC codes with modified reliability based hybrid ARQ and Unequal Error Protection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571900","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313674/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of IEEE 802.11n LDPC codes with modified reliability based hybrid ARQ and Unequal Error Protection","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061176S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313689,"authors":[{"name":"Juan A.

When high resolutions, low power budgets and huge amount of video data are demanded, exploiting parallelism is a mandatory task. In this paper we propose an implementation of the interpolation filter using the reconfigurable hardware technology, in order to build parallel computing systems that offer a high performance, in terms of computing time and power consumption. The timing simulations and energy analysis performed on different devices show that the on-chip replication of the filter provides high speedups with regard to general purpose processors. The good experimental results motivates us to do a first approach to scalable parallel computing systems where parallelism is exploited from fine to coarse grain, multiplying the speedups obtained. In particular, we propose an on-chip multiprocessor system where filters act as coprocessors of embedded high-performance and low-power microprocessors, linked among them by point-to-point buses. This on-chip architecture can be applied to high performance computing systems based on the same reconfigurable hardware technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313689.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313689","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance, power and scalability analysis of HEVC interpolation filter using FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313689/","displayDocTitle":"Performance, power and scalability analysis of HEVC interpolation filter using FPGAs","htmlLink":"/document/7313689/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15571891","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance, power and scalability analysis of HEVC interpolation filter using FPGAs","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071033S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7313700,"authors":[{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, IEETA, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"},{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, IEETA, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Alexander Sudnitson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sudnitson","id":"37283482500"},{"name":"Margus Kruus","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Margus","lastName":"Kruus","id":"37296689200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8568-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7313700","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Radiation detectors","Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Hamming weight","Adders","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","field programmable gate arrays","Hamming codes","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate array","FPGA","Hamming weight comparator","binary vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate arrays","Hamming weight counter","Hamming weight comparator","Parallel processing"]}],"abstract":"The paper shows that resources and performance of Hamming weight comparators for binary vectors significantly depend on available basic elements from which the comparators are built and, thus, to optimize the final circuits different design techniques need to be applied. The presented analysis of existing solutions clearly demonstrates that although they may be efficient for one platform (such as fully customized circuits), for another platform (such as FPGA) they become not advantageous at all. The paper suggests several, supplementing each other, Hamming weight counters and comparators based on optimized mapping of the circuits to FPGA look-up tables giving the best performance and the fewest resources compared to the best known alternatives. It is shown that the proposed methods are easily adjustable to a wide range of problem dimensions. Besides, the paper gives well-defined recommendations that enable the most appropriate circuit to be chosen for particular requirements such as the size of the vectors and the required performance.

The achieved fault coverage is 100% in the case of odd erroneous bits. The same coverage is achieved for even number of erroneous bits, if they are appropriately propagated.

Among them, Improved Sinc Power (ISP) pulse shaping technique is identified as the optimal solution, because it attains BER performances which almost completely match with the case of no ICI present.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICI reduction in OFDM Decode-and-Forward mobile relay systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313731.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"ICI reduction in OFDM Decode-and-Forward mobile relay systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313731/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571929","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICI reduction in OFDM Decode-and-Forward mobile relay systems","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041481S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313748,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Nuno Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Nuno","lastName":"Silva","id":"37085614630"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Nuno Matos","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Nuno","lastName":"Matos","id":"37296400800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8568-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7313748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313748","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Standards","Power amplifiers","OFDM","Impedance","Substrates","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","impedance matching","microwave power amplifiers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class AB power amplifier","IEEE802.11p","matching networks","amplifier gain improvement","amplifier power output improvement","D-class compliance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Amplifier","Vehicular Communications","IEEE802.11p","GaN HEMT","CAD"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a Power Amplifier (PA) for IEEE802.11p applications.

As femtocells are user-installed devices, subscribers will be more interested in acquiring them. Nonetheless, femtocells come with their challenges and one of the main problem associated with femtocells is interference. Interference can occur between macrocells and femtocells (cross-tier) or amidst femtocells (co-tier). This paper proposes a power control scheme which attempts at mitigating both co-tier and cross-tier interference. The benefit of this scheme is the significant reduction in the femtocell transmit power particularly at low traffic load. In contrast, to previous power control schemes, 100% and 76% decrease in the transmitting power of the femtocell is noted at low traffic loads for the user located furthest away from the access point, when the access point is positioned at the center and near the house edge of the ground floor respectively. Besides, 95% reduction in signal leakage out of the house is observed considering highest channel bandwidth compared to previous power control schemes when the access point is positioned in the middle of the house.","doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313749","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell power control scheme based on the maximum frame utilization technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313749/","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell power control scheme based on the maximum frame utilization technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571833","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313749/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell power control scheme based on the maximum frame utilization technique","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080141S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313750,"authors":[{"name":"Narvada Khedun","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Mauritius, Mauritius"],"firstName":"Narvada","lastName":"Khedun","id":"37085700362"},{"name":"Vandana Bassoo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Mauritius, Mauritius"],"firstName":"Vandana","lastName":"Bassoo","id":"37570779200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8568-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7313750","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Mathematical model","Queueing analysis","Cognitive radio","Sensors","Computational modeling","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","queueing theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priority queueing analysis","cognitive radio network","M/D/1 system","nonpreemptive priority queueing","secondary user","primary user","multichannel system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","M/D/1","Preemptive Priority Queueing","Non-Preemptive Priority Queueing","M/D/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313750","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313750.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of priority queueing with multichannel in cognitive radio network","abstract":"Since there is an ever-increasing demand of bandwidth, spectrum management is the key to provide sufficient spectrum for various services.

The system is modelled based on the M/D/1 system with priority queueing. Different approaches, preemptive and non-preemptive priority queueing, have been used for these models. Non-preemptive priority shows an improvement of about 32% (at small arrival rates) for the primary user and up to 38% for the secondary user, and with the preemptive priority, there is 19%-42% and up to 33% (at small arrival rates) reduction in the primary user and secondary user waiting times respectively. Furthermore, a multichannel system, the M/D/s model is proposed and it is also investigated with the preemptive and non-preemptive priority queueing. The non-preemptive model shows a decrease in the secondary user waiting time, by allowing it to effectively occupy the time slots without affecting the primary user transmission. Moreover, the primary user waiting time is reduced by means of the preemptive model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313750/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15571806","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313750/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of priority queueing with multichannel in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of priority queueing with multichannel in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048118S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7313756,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Bernab\u00e9","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture and Automation, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bernab\u00e9","id":"38235772200"},{"name":"Gabriel Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Mart\u00edn","id":"37402451100"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

The performance gain of the Bayesian-based ED scheme with/without using the optimal threshold is compared to the conventional ED.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313653","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299993/7313653/07313791.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy detection of random arrival and departure of primary user signals in Cognitive Radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7313791/","displayDocTitle":"Energy detection of random arrival and departure of primary user signals in Cognitive Radio systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571808","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy detection of random arrival and departure of primary user signals in Cognitive Radio systems","confLoc":"Salamanca, Spain","sourcePdf":"205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048482S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299993","isNumber":"7313653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299993","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7313653","articleId":"7313791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7313804,"authors":[{"name":"Wouter Diels","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Diels","id":"37085617644"},{"name":"Alexander Standaert","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Standaert","id":"37085625360"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8568-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7313804","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313804","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Memristors","Capacitance","Integrated circuit modeling","Reliability","Ash"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","flash memories","reliability","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["45nm technology","RC-latch-effect","amplifier performance","maximum bitline voltage difference","multiple reference cell","tuned reference signal","reliability","1Mbit RRAM memory","eFlash"]}],"abstract":"A 1Mbit RRAM memory robust against variations in 45nm technology is presented.

After, benefited from architecture optimizations and symbol-serial property, the routing capability of proposed decoder is extraordinarily enhanced. According to the measurement results, this decoder can deliver 1.31Gb/s throughput under 368MHz clock frequency with the corresponding energy-efficiency of 0.45nJ/bit.

High frequency boost at Nyquist is also desirable to partially recover ISI and relax the requirements of electronic dispersion compensation. In this work, a PGA for 25Gb/s MMF receivers is proposed. Shunt and series inductors between cascaded stages are exploited to achieve programmable high-frequency boost independent from in-band gain and with a sharp out-of-band roll-off. Compared to typical RC-degenerated gain stages, the adopted solution enables very low noise operation. Realized in 28nm CMOS FDSOI technology the PGA has a programmable gain ranging from 15dB to 29dB with 0.15 dB fine steps and up to 14.2dB boost at Nyquist frequency. Power consumption is 32mW and equivalent input noise, at maximum high-frequency boost, is 300\u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n only.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Noise","Electronics packaging","CMOS integrated circuits","Shunts (electrical)","Inductors","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated optoelectronics","low noise amplifiers","optical fibre communication","optical receivers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise programmable gain amplifier","multimode fiber receiver","CMOS FDSOI","wide bandwidth amplifier","very low noise amplifier","high gain amplifier","finely adjustable amplifier","intersymbol interference","Nyquist frequency","bit rate 25 Gbit/s","size 28 nm","power 32 mW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2015.7313853","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2015 - 41st European Solid-State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2015 - 41st European Solid-State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7300343/7313811/07313853.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2015.7313853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-noise programmable-gain amplifier for 25 Gb/s multi-mode fiber receivers in 28nm CMOS FDSOI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-noise programmable-gain amplifier for 25 Gb/s multi-mode fiber receivers in 28nm CMOS FDSOI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313853/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313853/","accessionNumber":"15571940","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-noise programmable-gain amplifier for 25 Gb/s multi-mode fiber receivers in 28nm CMOS FDSOI","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"C040A6LC51147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043897S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7300343","isNumber":"7313811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7300343","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7313811","articleId":"7313853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7313855,"authors":[{"name":"Aritra Banerjee","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Dallas, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Aritra","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37307211900"},{"name":"Lei Ding","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Dallas, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Ding","id":"38467719300"},{"name":"Rahmi Hezar","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Dallas, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Rahmi","lastName":"Hezar","id":"37269952000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7472-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7470-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7471-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"7313855","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":969},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","CMOS integrated circuits","Switches","Switching circuits","Radio frequency","Capacitors","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Long Term Evolution","passive networks","quadrature amplitude modulation","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high efficiency RF power amplifier","multimode outphasing RF power amplifier","class-E outphasing RF power amplifier","passive combining circuit","efficiency enhancement circuit","EEC","CMOS technology","high power single level mode","64-QAM LTE signal","single level outphasing mode","AMO mode","size 45 nm","frequency 2.4 GHz","efficiency 49.2 percent","bandwidth 10 MHz","bandwidth 20 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF","power amplifier","CMOS","outphasing","asymmetric multilevel outphasing (AMO)","class-E","LTE","WLAN"]}],"abstract":"A high efficiency multi-mode class-E outphasing RF power amplifier with a passive combining circuit is presented.

Due to its inherent high linearity, the amplifier can be allowed to have a reduced settling to further enhance its power efficiency while still maintaining the required linearity performance.

The digital power for calibration also becomes negligible, since the detection of gain errors can be done digitally at a slow rate.

The premature convergence to local minima, as a result of search space boundary constraints, is a key consideration in the application of SGAs. The new method improves the convergence to global optima by resizing or extending the upper and lower search boundaries. The resizing of search space boundaries involves two processes, first, an identification of initial value by approximating the dynamic response period and desired settling time. Second, a boundary resizing method derived from the initial search space value. These processes brought the elite groups within feasible boundary regions by consecutive execution and enhanced the SGAs in locating the optimal model's parameters for the identified transfer function. This new method is applied and examined on two processes, a third order transfer function model with and without random disturbance and raw data of excess oxygen. The simulation results assured the new improved search space resizing method's efficiency and flexibility in assisting SGAs to locate optimal transfer function model parameters in their explorations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7313940/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15572246","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7313940/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"11-12 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved search space resizing method for model identification by Standard Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved search space resizing method for model identification by Standard Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"p22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087519S","chronDate":"11-12 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7301994","isNumber":"7313638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7301994","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7313638","articleId":"7313940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACS","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7313980,"authors":[{"name":"Naji Al-Messabi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K"],"firstName":"Naji","lastName":"Al-Messabi","id":"38467191400"},{"name":"Cindy Goh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K"],"firstName":"Cindy","lastName":"Goh","id":"37085575659"},{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","id":"37336372600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9926-8011-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9926-8010-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7313980","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Predictive models","Atmospheric modeling","Data models","Forecasting","Adaptation models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting theory","grey systems","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","power generation planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey-box identification","photovoltaic power systems","particle swarm algorithm","forecasting models","clear box models","uncertain parameter","heuristic algorithms","grey-box forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7313980","abstract":"Amongst renewable generators, photovoltaics (PV) are becoming more popular as the appropriate low cost solution to meet increasing energy demands. However, the integration of renewable energy sources to the electricity grid possesses many challenges. The intermittency of these non-conventional sources often requires accurate forecast, planning and optimal management. Many attempts have been made to tackle these challenges; nonetheless, existing methods fail to accurately capture the underlying characteristics of the system. There exists scope to improve present PV yield forecasting models and methods.

However, as feature sizes and power supply voltages continually decrease, the devices and interconnects have become more vulnerable to transient errors. Transient errors, or soft errors, have severe consequences on chip performance, such as deadlock, data corruption, packet loss and increased packet latency. In this paper, we propose a soft-error resilient 3D-NoC router (SER-3DR) architecture for highly-reliable many-core Systems-on-Chips. The proposed architecture is able to recover from transient errors occurring in different pipeline stages of the SER-3DR.We implemented the architecture in hardware with 45 nm CMOS technology. Evaluation results show that SER-3DR is able to achieve a high level of transient error protection with a latency increase of 18.16%, an additional area cost of 14.98% and a power overhead of 5.90% when compared to the baseline router architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICAwST.2015.7314025","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304348/7314003/07314025.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAwST.2015.7314025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314003","startPage":"84","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-error resilient 3D Network-on-Chip router","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft-error resilient 3D Network-on-Chip router","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314025/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583082","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314025/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-error resilient 3D Network-on-Chip router","confLoc":"Qinhuangdao, China","sourcePdf":"15iCAST2015submission26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053388S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304348","isNumber":"7314003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304348","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7314003","articleId":"7314025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314060,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Jie","affiliation":["Open Lab on Human-Robot Interaction, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jie","id":"37087424190"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Open Lab on Human-Robot Interaction, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279504000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-5329-0056-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7314060","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Principal component analysis","Speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","compensation","delays","principal component analysis","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","beamforming","sensor arrays","directional weighting","dual-channel beamformer","time-delay compensation","TDC","shifted principal components analysis","binaural cues","interaural time-delay","intensity difference","shifted PCA","post-filter","speech intelligibility"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314060","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314060","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","abstract":"Speech enhancement is an essential technique to process degraded audio in various applications. Beamforming to eliminate interferences based on sensor arrays is the most well-known method for this issue. However, traditional beamformers often face magnitude incoherence towards received signals due to directional weighting. Therefore, a novel dual-channel beamformer based on time-delay compensation (TDC) and shifted principal components analysis (PCA) is presented in this work. Firstly, our enhancement algorithm utilizes TDC estimator to preserve binaural cues, including interaural time-delay and intensity difference. Then the estimated cues are comprised to improve the shifted PCA, which can reduce noise by extracting primary components. Finally, the aforehand processed audio are input to a beamformer with post-filter to obtain enhanced speech. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could achieve some superiorities in speech intelligibility compared with the state-of-the-arts against real scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314051","startPage":"180","endPage":"184","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303284/7314051/07314060.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual-channel beamformer based on time-delay compensation estimator and shifted PCA for speech enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314060/","displayDocTitle":"A dual-channel beamformer based on time-delay compensation estimator and shifted PCA for speech enhancement","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572361","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-channel beamformer based on time-delay compensation estimator and shifted PCA for speech enhancement","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"ADualChannelBeamformerZhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064744S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303284","isNumber":"7314051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303284","xplore-issue":"7314051","articleId":"7314060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314061,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Marco C.

To mitigate ICI, Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) is proposed to improve cell-edge users' performance. In CoMP mode, base stations need to reserve same frequencies for these CoMP users. However, mobile communication network is a dynamic network. Users distribution are always changing, therefore it will be beneficial to configure CoMP dynamically. In this study, an intelligent algorithm is designed and implemented to dynamically adjust CoMP configuration to optimize system performance. In the algorithm, base stations cooperatively divide CoMP and Non CoMP users according to user traffic scenarios and cooperatively adjust configuration of CoMP users. Genetic Algorithm is coupled to the proposed algorithm to optimize CoMP division.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Bayesian network methods, a comparative study is performed between the naive Bayes using discretization (NBD), the tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) and the decision tree (J48) classifiers. Through the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, the probability of identification and the training time, we show that the NBD and the TAN classifiers achieve nearly similar performance compared to the J48 classifier. Hence, these classifiers can be used to distinguish between different M-ary shift keying linear modulation types and thus lead to better monitoring of the intercepted signals in broadband technologies with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314109","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303284/7314051/07314109.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance evaluation of Bayesian network classifiers in modulation identification for cooperative MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314109/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance evaluation of Bayesian network classifiers in modulation identification for cooperative MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572343","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314109/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance evaluation of Bayesian network classifiers in modulation identification for cooperative MIMO systems","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"OnthePerformanceChikha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050327S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303284","isNumber":"7314051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303284","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7314051","articleId":"7314109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314112,"authors":[{"name":"Yosra Mallat","affiliation":["Research Unit MEDIATRON, Higher School Of communication of Tunisia (Sup'Com), TUNIS, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Yosra","lastName":"Mallat"},{"name":"Aymen Ayari","affiliation":["Research Unit MEDIATRON, Higher School Of communication of Tunisia (Sup'Com), TUNIS, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Aymen","lastName":"Ayari"},{"name":"Mohamed Ayadi","affiliation":["Research Unit MEDIATRON, Higher School Of communication of Tunisia (Sup'Com), TUNIS, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ayadi"},{"name":"Sami Tabaane","affiliation":["Research Unit MEDIATRON, Higher School Of communication of Tunisia (Sup'Com), TUNIS, TUNISIA"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Tabaane"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-5329-0056-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7314112","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks","Delays","Routing","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","performance evaluation","quality of service","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","QoS-CAODV","CAODV routing protocol","cognitive radio ad-hoc network","spectrum utilization","cognitive ad hoc on demand distance vector","primary user","packet transfer","quality of service","numerical simulations","OPNET 14.5","end-to-end delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio (CR)","CAODV","QoS-CAODV","routing protocol","OPNET 14.5 simulator"]}],"abstract":"A large number of routing protocols for Cognitive Radio (CR) have been recently proposed to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization. As an example, we can find the Cognitive Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (CAODV). This protocol is based on AODV one and uses an on-demand approach for finding routes to which the principals of regions activity avoidance of the Primary User (PU) has been added during the packet transfer. The main drawback of this protocol is that it doesn't support the Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to develop, implement and test a new protocol that integrate the QoS adaption mechanism in cognitive on demand routing protocol. The new protocol, called QoS-CAODV, is a combination of QoS-AODV and CAODV. The performances of QoS-CAODV protocol have been evaluated by numerical simulations (OPNET 14.5). We have observed from results that the QoS-CAODV protocol provides better performance in term of average throughput, end-to-end delay and gives the smallest number of dropped packets.","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314112","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303284/7314051/07314112.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314112","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of QoS-CAODV, CAODV routing protocol in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of QoS-CAODV, CAODV routing protocol in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314112/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314112/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572341","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of QoS-CAODV, CAODV routing protocol in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc network","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"PerformanceEvaluationofYosra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043998S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303284","isNumber":"7314051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303284","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7314051","articleId":"7314112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314121,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Wen Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of Electronics National Chiao Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Wen","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37085628967"},{"name":"Ying-Tsung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of Electronics National Chiao Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Tsung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37985028200"},{"name":"Sau-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of Electronics National Chiao Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sau-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-5329-0056-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7314121","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314121","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Robustness","Optimization","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","convex programming","mathematical programming","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward relay systems","multiple user pairs","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR-based robust distributed beamforming scheme","optimal beam vectors","convex semi-definite programming optimization","interference powers","Cauchy-Swartz inequality","transmit power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed beamforming","coorperative communication","amplify-and-forward"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314121","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303284/7314051/07314121.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust distributed beamforming design in amplify-and-forward relay systems with multiple user pairs","abstract":"In this work, a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based robust distributed beamforming scheme is proposed for one-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems with multiple user pairs.

CPU and GPU cores will be able to concurrently access the same memories, eliminating memory copy overheads and potentially changing the application-level optimization targets. To date, little is known about how developers may organize new applications to leverage the available, finer-grained communication in these processors. However, understanding potential application optimizations and adaptations is critical for directing heterogeneous processor programming model and architectural development. This paper quantifies opportunities for applications and architectures to evolve to leverage the new capabilities of heterogeneous processors. To identify these opportunities, we ported and simulated a broad set of benchmarks originally developed for discrete GPUs to remove memory copies, and applied analytical models to quantify their application-level pipeline inefficiencies. For existing benchmarks, GPU bulk-synchronous software pipelines result in considerable core and cache utilization inefficiency. For heterogeneous processors, the results indicate increased opportunity for techniques that provide flexible compute and data granularities, and support for efficient producer-consumer data handling and synchronization within caches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314150/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15573280","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314150/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"GPU Computing Pipeline Inefficiencies and Optimization Opportunities in Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU Computing Pipeline Inefficiencies and Optimization Opportunities in Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Processors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0088a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099542S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313079","isNumber":"7314131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313079","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7314131","articleId":"7314150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7314151,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Daga","affiliation":["AMD Research Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Daga","id":"37842731200"},{"name":"Zachary S.

However, programming heterogeneous systems via traditional programming models like OpenCL or CUDA involves rewriting large portions of application-code. They also lead to code that is not performance portable across different architectures or even across different generations of the same architecture. In this paper, we evaluate the current state of two emerging parallel programming models: C++ AMP and OpenACC. These emerging programming paradigms require minimal code changes and rely on compilers to interact with the low-level hardware language, thereby producing performance portable code from an application standpoint. We analyze the performance and productivity of the emerging programming models and compare them with OpenCL using a diverse set of applications on two different architectures, a CPU coupled with a discrete GPU and an Accelerated Programming Unit (APU). Our experiments demonstrate that while the emerging programming models improve programmer productivity, they do not yet expose enough flexibility to extract maximum performance as compared to traditional programming models.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2015.16","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313079/7314131/07314151.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2015.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Parallel Programming Models for Heterogeneous Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Parallel Programming Models for Heterogeneous Computing Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583208","htmlLink":"/document/7314151/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Parallel Programming Models for Heterogeneous Computing Systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0088a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0673S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313079","isNumber":"7314131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313079","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7314131","articleId":"7314151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7314153,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Wong","id":"37085713239"},{"name":"Julia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside"],"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085706522"},{"name":"Murali Annavaram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside"],"firstName":"Murali","lastName":"Annavaram","id":"37298092100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0088-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0087-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7314153","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Program processors","Random access memory","Predictive models","Market research","Correlation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy proportionality","retrospective look back","statistical regression","SPEC power result","EP improvement"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we take a retrospective look back at the road taken towards improving energy proportionality, in order to find out where we are currently, and how we got here.

Performance improvements often come at a non-negligible price in terms of area and critical path length and imply deeper pipelines and complex memory interfaces. This penalizes control-intensive code execution and significantly increases cost and complexity of building multi-core clusters. In addition, some extensions are not easily exploited by compilers and may increase code development effort, especially when considering parallel applications. In this paper we describe our efforts in enhancing a baseline open ISA (OpenRISC) and its LLVM compiler back-end to significantly reduce execution cycles while minimizing the impact on core micro-architecture complexity, number of pipeline stages, area and power. In addition, we improved the core micro-architecture to streamline its integration in a tightly-coupled cluster, sharing instruction cache and data memory, thereby further enhancing parallel execution efficiency. The combined effect of ISA, compiler and micro-architecture evolution gives an average energy efficiency boost of 59% on vector intensive code and 41% otherwise, at an area and power increase of 2.3% and 18% on a four-core processor cluster.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314386","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tailoring instruction-set extensions for an ultra-low power tightly-coupled cluster of OpenRISC cores","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tailoring instruction-set extensions for an ultra-low power tightly-coupled cluster of OpenRISC cores","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314386/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572513","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314386/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tailoring instruction-set extensions for an ultra-low power tightly-coupled cluster of OpenRISC cores","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075107S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314390,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-sun Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jae-sun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37085457143"},{"name":"Mingoo Seok","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mingoo","lastName":"Seok","id":"37541098600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9140-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9139-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"7314390","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Neuromorphics","Neural networks","CMOS integrated circuits","Hardware","System-on-chip","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","logic circuits","logic design","low-power electronics","neural nets","power aware computing","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital CMOS neuromorphic processor design","unsupervised online learning","spiking neural networks","digital CMOS circuits","transistor scaling","dynamic voltage scaling","synapse hardware precision","efficient synapse memory array access","voltage 0.53 V","voltage 0.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neuromorphic computing","CMOS","digital circuits","unsupervised learning","on-chip learning","low-voltage","low-power","spiking neural networks"]}],"abstract":"The compute-intensive and power-efficient brain has been a source of inspiration for a broad range of neural networks to solve recognition and classification tasks. Compared to the supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been very successful on well-defined labeled datasets, bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) with unsupervised learning rules could be well-suited for training and learning representations from the massive amount of unlabeled data. To design dense and low-power hardware for such unsupervised SNNs, we employ digital CMOS circuits for neuromorphic processors, which can exploit transistor scaling and dynamic voltage scaling to the utmost. As exemplary works, we present two neuromorphic processor designs. First, a 45nm neuromorphic chip is designed for a small-scale network of spiking neurons. Through tight integration of memory (64k SRAM synapses) and computation (256 digital neurons), the chip demonstrates on-chip learning on pattern recognition tasks down to 0.53V supply. Secondly, a 65nm neuromorphic processor that performs unsupervised on-line spike-clustering for brain sensing applications is implemented with 1.2k digital neurons and 4.7k latch-based synapses. The processor exhibits a power consumption of 9.3\u03bcW/ch at 0.3V supply.

It is expected that they will replace traditional SRAM as FPGA reconfigurable blocks. While NVMs promise FPGAs with more reconfigurable resources, lower power consumption, and higher resilience to power interruptions, they also impose two new design challenges: the slow write performance of NVMs may degrade FPGA reconfiguration speed, while their limited write endurance constrains FPGA programming cycles. To overcome these challenges, we propose a similarity driven approach to reduce reconfiguration cost in NVM-based FPGAs. When synthesizing a new design, its similarity to the design currently on the FPGA is characterized by taking both LUT contents and CLB-level topology into consideration. The reconfiguration cost minimization problem is formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem and solved optimally. Experiments on standard circuit benchmarks show that the proposed algorithms eliminate more than 57.4% of NVM writes during the reconfiguration process, thus effectively improving performance and endurance of NVM-based FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314398","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314398.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-volatile memories in FPGAs: Exploiting logic similarity to accelerate reconfiguration and increase programming cycles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314398/","displayDocTitle":"Non-volatile memories in FPGAs: Exploiting logic similarity to accelerate reconfiguration and increase programming cycles","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314398/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583091","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-volatile memories in FPGAs: Exploiting logic similarity to accelerate reconfiguration and increase programming cycles","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070003S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314401,"authors":[{"name":"Motoki Amagasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoki","lastName":"Amagasaki","id":"37295778700"},{"name":"Yuto Takeuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuto","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37085669002"},{"name":"Qian Zhao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37896730600"},{"name":"Masahiro Iida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Iida","id":"37290518600"},{"name":"Morihiro Kuga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Morihiro","lastName":"Kuga","id":"37603417800"},{"name":"Toshinori Sueyoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Sueyoshi","id":"37302132800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9140-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9139-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"7314401","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Delays","Through-silicon vias","Stacking","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design","network routing","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D field-programmable gate array","3D FPGA architectures","wafer-to-wafer bonding","through-silicon vias","TSV","3D large-scale integrated chips","3D integration processes","logic layer","routing layer","face-down process technology","microbumps"]}],"abstract":"A three-dimensional (3D) integration based on wafer-to-wafer bonding using through-silicon vias (TSVs) has been developed for the fabrication of new 3D large-scale integrated chips. To balance between cost and performance, and to explore 3D field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with realistic 3D integration processes, we propose spatially distributed and functionally distributed types of 3D FPGA architectures. The functionally distributed architecture consists of two wafers, a logic layer and a routing layer, and is stacked by a face-down process technology. Since vertical wires pass through microbumps, no TSVs are needed. In contrast, the spatially distributed architecture is divided into multiple layers with the same structure, unlike in the functionally distributed type. This architecture can be expanded to more than two layers by stacking multiples of the same die. The goal of this paper is to elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of these two types of 3D FPGAs. According to our evaluation, when only two layers are used, the functionally distributed architecture is more effective. When higher performance is achieved by using more than two layers, the spatially distributed architecture achieves better performance.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314401","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314401.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture exploration of 3D FPGA to minimize internal layer connection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314401/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture exploration of 3D FPGA to minimize internal layer connection","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314401/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572498","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture exploration of 3D FPGA to minimize internal layer connection","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079148S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314402,"authors":[{"name":"Bartosz Boguslawski","affiliation":["Univ.

However, since they are wire-dominated systems, their hardware implementation poses numerous challenges as high latency and energy consumption. The recent technological improvements allow for stacking few dies one on another and designing 3D electronic circuits. This creates opportunities for 3D efficient implementations of neural networks targeting high-performance applications. This work explores the gains of 3D technology for neural networks relying on neural cliques. A general study shows up to 55% reduction in terms of total interconnect length and interconnect power consumption, and 74% reduction of the maximal interconnect delay. The proposed approach is validated with a power management applicative test-case. We demonstrate that, in this scenario, the 3D architecture reduces interconnect length and power by 35% and the maximal delay by 57%, compared to 2D.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314402","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314402.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact interconnect approach for networks of neural cliques using 3D technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314402/","displayDocTitle":"Compact interconnect approach for networks of neural cliques using 3D technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572475","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314402/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact interconnect approach for networks of neural cliques using 3D technology","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104267S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314406,"authors":[{"name":"Asim Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Asim","lastName":"Khan","id":"38238768000"},{"name":"Muhammad Umar Karim Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad Umar Karim","lastName":"Khan"},{"name":"Muhammad Bilal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Bilal","id":"37085684883"},{"name":"Chong-Min Kyung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chong-Min","lastName":"Kyung","id":"37277218400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9140-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9139-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"7314406","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Hardware","Computer architecture","Accuracy","Microprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image enhancement","image resolution","object detection","pedestrians","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture","sliding window based pedestrian detection","FPGA","field programmable gate array","high resolution images","local features variation","histogram-of-oriented gradients","HOG scheme","LinSVM","linear support vector machine","cell size","histogram bins","feature enhancement","GPU","graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Low Power","Object Detection","Real-Time"]}],"abstract":"Pedestrian detection has lately attracted considerable interest from researchers due to many practical applications. However, the low accuracy and high complexity of pedestrian detection has still not enabled its use in successful commercial applications. In this paper, we present insights into the complexity-accuracy relationship of pedestrian detection. We consider the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) scheme with linear Support Vector Machine (LinSVM) as a benchmark. We describe parallel implementations of various blocks of the pedestrian detection system which are designed for full-HD (1920\u00d71080) resolution. Features are improved by optimal selection of cell size and histogram bins which have been shown to significantly affect the accuracy and complexity of pedestrian detection. It is seen that with a careful choice of these parameters a frame rate of 39.2 fps is achieved with a negligible loss in accuracy which is 16.3x and 3.8x higher than state of the art GPU and FPGA implementations respectively. Moreover 97.14% and 10.2% reduction in energy consumption is observed to process one frame. Finally, features are further enhanced by removing petty gradients in histograms which result in loss of accuracy. This increases the frame rate to 42.7 fps (18x and 4.1x higher) and lowers the energy consumption by 97.34% and 16.4% while improving the accuracy by 2% as compared to state of the art GPU and FPGA implementations respectively.","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314406.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware architecture and optimization of sliding window based pedestrian detection on FPGA for high resolution images by varying local features","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware architecture and optimization of sliding window based pedestrian detection on FPGA for high resolution images by varying local features","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572486","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314406/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware architecture and optimization of sliding window based pedestrian detection on FPGA for high resolution images by varying local features","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082189S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314413,"authors":[{"name":"Namhyung Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Namhyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085641717"},{"name":"Junwhan Ahn","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Junwhan","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37855457600"},{"name":"Woong Seo","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Woong","lastName":"Seo","id":"38529281800"},{"name":"Kiyoung Choi","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Kiyoung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277046400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9140-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9139-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"7314413","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314413","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Energy consumption","Radiation detectors","Magnetic tunneling","Benchmark testing","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM","STT-RAM","energy-efficient exclusive last-level hybrid caches","cache capacity","cache blocks","cache hierarchy","lower-level cache","last-level cache","extra write overhead","reuse distance prediction","energy consumption"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an energy-efficient exclusive last-level cache design based on STT-RAM, which is an emerging memory technology that has higher density and lower static power compared to SRAM. Exclusive caches are known to provide higher effective cache capacity than inclusive caches by removing duplicated copies of cache blocks across hierarchies. However, in exclusive cache hierarchies, every block evicted from the lower-level cache is written back to the last-level cache regardless of its dirtiness thereby incurring extra write overhead. This makes it challenging to use STT-RAM for exclusive last-level caches due to its high write energy and long write latency. To mitigate this problem, we design an SRAM/STT-RAM hybrid cache architecture based on reuse distance prediction. In our architecture, for the cache blocks evicted from the lower-level cache, blocks that are likely to be accessed again soon are inserted into the SRAM region and blocks that are unlikely to be reused are forced to bypass the last-level cache. Evaluation results show that the proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption of the last-level cache while slightly improving the system performance.","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304349/7314373/07314413.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314413","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2015.7314413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient exclusive last-level hybrid caches consisting of SRAM and STT-RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient exclusive last-level hybrid caches consisting of SRAM and STT-RAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314413/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314413/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15572483","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient exclusive last-level hybrid caches consisting of SRAM and STT-RAM","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089037S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304349","isNumber":"7314373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304349","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7314373","articleId":"7314413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314418,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Kumar Jaiswal","affiliation":["Department of EEE, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Manish Kumar","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"37648457900"},{"name":"Hayden K.-H So","affiliation":["Department of EEE, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hayden K.-H","lastName":"So","id":"37302177600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9140-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9139-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"}],"articleNumber":"7314418","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Pipelines","Multiplexing","Throughput","Adders","Data mining","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","floating point arithmetic","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-mode double precision floating point multiplier architecture","two-parallel single precision floating point multiplier architecture","floating point multiplication","contemporary computing system","DPdSP multiplier","ASIC","single-mode design units","computational flow","configurable dual-mode operation","resource sharing","design metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating Point Multiplier","Dual-mode Arithmetic","SIMD","ASIC","Digital Arithmetic"]}],"abstract":"Floating point multiplication is an integral part of any contemporary computing system.

The proposed architecture is based on the standard state-of-the-art flow of floating point multiplication, which can process normal and sub-normal operands along with exceptional case handling. The proposed architecture is aimed for a ASIC (UMC 90nm) implementation. The key single-mode design units in the computational flow (like mantissa multiplier, dynamic right/left shifters, leading one detector, etc) are re-designed for configurable dual-mode operation to enable efficient resource sharing. The proposed architecture is compared with the best available literature in terms of area, period and area \u00d7 period / throughput complexity metric.

Unit cells are defined with a single transistor (one source and one drain) with 4 gate connections of 1.2 \u03bcm width each. External gate capacitances appropriate for the desired voltage division along the transistor are implemented within the unit cell itself using the metal stack available in the CMOS technology. The unit cell can be replicated in straightforward fashion to implement larger effective gate widths. In this work, an aggregate width of 307 \u03bcm is used, with simple input and output matching, to provide an amplifier centered at 28 GHz.

The transmitter IC is capable of generating 4-PAM signals as large as 3.5Vpp differential and up to 128Gb/s. The transmitter also employs feed-forward equalization with digitally adjustable coefficients. The receiver IC employs a full baud-rate clock and data recovery system and an internal PLL to assist lock acquisition. The transceiver chipset operates from a single 3.3V power supply and consumes 8W in total. By using this chipset, a 112-Gbit/s, 4-PAM transmission over 2-km of single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314464/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314464/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15573226","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 112Gb/s 4-PAM Transceiver Chipset in 0.18&#181;m SiGe BiCMOS Technology for Optical Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 112Gb/s 4-PAM Transceiver Chipset in 0.18&#181;m SiGe BiCMOS Technology for Optical Communication Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1167212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043785S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312801","isNumber":"7314445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312801","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7314445","articleId":"7314464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7314465,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Furqan","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Furqan","id":"37954938200"},{"name":"Faisal Ahmed","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37971428200"},{"name":"Holger Rucker","affiliation":["IHP GmbH, Frankfurt(Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Rucker","id":"37285133100"},{"name":"Andreas Stelzer","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Stelzer","id":"37277223300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8494-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8493-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-8781"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"}],"articleNumber":"7314465","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Gain","Silicon germanium","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Broadband communication","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","millimetre wave amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband amplifier","SiGe BiCMOS technology","fully differential cascode topology","bandwidth T-type input","output matching networks","gain-bandwidth product","GBW","size 0.13 mum","bandwidth 46 GHz","power 132 mW","frequency 140 GHz to 180 GHz","frequency 400 GHz","SiGe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314465","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2015.7314465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2015.7314465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314445","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312801/7314445/07314465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 140-180-GHz Broadband Amplifier with 7 dBm OP1dB and 400 GHz GBW in SiGe BiCMOS","abstract":"This paper presents the design and measurements of a broadband amplifier realized in a 0.13-\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS technology.

InP DHBT PA MMICs, with an excess of 80 mW output power and >15 dB small signal gain, are used in this SSPA. To connect the MMICs to the 16-way splitter-combiner network, a micromachined WR4 E-probe to CPW transition was developed. These transitions use micro-length-wire-bonds exhibiting capability at sub-mmw frequencies. The broadband transitions showcase <;0.5 dB insertion loss and exhibit tight tolerances due to the batch additive manufacturing process. The SSPA was assembled using 16 mounted MMICs with transitions and demonstrated >11 dB small signal gain from 200-230 GHz. Large signal characterization showcased high saturated output power of 580 mW at 200 GHz, 820 mW at 216 GHz, 680 mW at 225 GHz and 380 mW at 230 GHz in an ultra-compact volume of 45 cm3 demonstrating a functional power density of >18 mW/cm3.

These larger periphery devices should ultimately allow for greater saturated output power levels, though this is not confirmed at the time of this writing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314487/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573205","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Advances in InP HEMT WR1.5 Amplifier MMICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in InP HEMT WR1.5 Amplifier MMICs","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1167314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047031S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312801","isNumber":"7314445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312801","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7314445","articleId":"7314487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7314489,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Nakajima","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology Tsukuba, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Nakajima","id":"37870357700"},{"name":"Sin-ichi Nishizawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology Tsukuba, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Sin-ichi","lastName":"Nishizawa","id":"37085721983"},{"name":"Shunsuke Kubota","affiliation":["New-generation Power Electronics and system Research Consortium, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37085499533"},{"name":"Rei Kayanuma","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Rei","lastName":"Kayanuma","id":"37085500885"},{"name":"Kazuo Tsutsui","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Tsutsui","id":"37085411979"},{"name":"Hiromichi Ohashi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Ohashi","id":"37085491446"},{"name":"Kuniyuki Kakushima","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Kuniyuki","lastName":"Kakushima","id":"37085405616"},{"name":"Hitoshi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Wakabayashi","id":"37085404655"},{"name":"Hiroshi Iwai","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Iwai","id":"37085409891"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8494-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8493-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-8781"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"}],"articleNumber":"7314489","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","MODFETs","Gallium nitride","Two dimensional hole gas","Temperature","Logic gates","Aluminum gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","monolithic integrated circuits","polarisation","power integrated circuits","power semiconductor diodes","power transistors","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithic power integrated circuit technology","polarization-junction platform","polarization-junction technologies","PJ technologies","2D hole gas","2DHG","2D electron gas","2DEG","polarization charges","n-channel transistors","p-channel transistors","temperature independent properties","high voltage transistors","GaN-AlGaN-GaN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2015.7314489","endPage":"4","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312801/7314445/07314489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2015.7314489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of GaN-Based Monolithic Power Integrated Circuit Technology on Polarization-Junction Platform","abstract":"This paper gives an overview of GaN-based polarization-junction (PJ) technologies.

The use of crowd sourcing image and videos on crisis management systems can aid in these situations by providing more information than verbal/textual descriptions. Due to the usual high volume of data, automatic solutions need to discard non-relevant content without losing relevant information. There are several methods for fire detection on video using color-based models. However, they are not adequate for still image processing, because they can suffer on high false-positive results. These methods also suffer from parameters with little physical meaning, which makes fine tuning a difficult task. In this context, we propose a novel fire detection method for still images that uses classification based on color features combined with texture classification on super pixel regions. Our method uses a reduced number of parameters if compared to previous works, easing the process of fine tuning the method. Results show the effectiveness of our method of reducing false-positives while its precision remains compatible with the state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Videos","Training","Clustering algorithms","Color","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency management","fires","image classification","image colour analysis","image texture","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel color","texture analysis","BoWFire","fire detection method","color features","texture classification","superpixel regions","Best of both Worlds Fire detection","still images","emergency situations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fire detection","still images","pixel-color classification","texture feature"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.19","publicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312722/7314530/07314551.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BoWFire: Detection of Fire in Still Images by Integrating Pixel Color and Texture Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BoWFire: Detection of Fire in Still Images by Integrating Pixel Color and Texture Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314551/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314551/","accessionNumber":"15573138","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BoWFire: Detection of Fire in Still Images by Integrating Pixel Color and Texture Analysis","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7962a095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064037S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312722","isNumber":"7314530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312722","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7314530","articleId":"7314551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":7314555,"authors":[{"name":"Rensso Victor Hugo Mora Colque","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, BR"],"firstName":"Rensso Victor Hugo Mora","lastName":"Colque"},{"name":"Carlos Ant\u00f4nio Caetano J\u00fanior","firstName":"Carlos Ant\u00f4nio Caetano","lastName":"J\u00fanior"},{"name":"William Robson Schwartz","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"],"firstName":"William Robson","lastName":"Schwartz","id":"37325223000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7962-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7961-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5416"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1834"}],"articleNumber":"7314555","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":695},"abstract":"Modeling human behavior and activity patterns for recognition or detection of anomalous events has attracted significant research interest in recent years, particularly among the video surveillance community. An anomalous event might be characterized as an event that deviates from the normal or usual, but not necessarily in an undesirable manner, e.g., An anomalous event might just be different from normal but not a suspicious event from the surveillance stand point. One of the main challenges of detecting such events is the difficulty to create models due to their unpredictability. Therefore, most works model the expected patterns on the scene, instead, based on video sequences where anomalous events do not occur. Assuming images captured from a single camera, we propose a novel spatiotemporal feature descriptor, called Histograms of Optical Flow Orientation and Magnitude (HOFM), based on optical flow information to describe the normal patterns on the scene, so that we can employ a simple nearest neighbor search to identify whether a given unknown pattern should be classified as an anomalous event. Our descriptor captures spatiotemporal information from cuboids (regions with spatial and temporal support) and encodes both magnitude and orientation of the optical flow separately into histograms, differently from previous works, which are based only on the orientation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach is able to detect anomalous events with success, achieving better results than the descriptor based only on optical flow orientation and outperforming several state-of-the-art methods on one scenario (Peds2) of the well-known UCSD anomaly data set, and achieving comparable results in the other scenario (Peds1).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312722/7314530/07314555.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histograms of Optical Flow Orientation and Magnitude to Detect Anomalous Events in Videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Histograms","Feature extraction","Hidden Markov models","Image motion analysis","Computer vision","Nearest neighbor searches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image sequences","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous video event detection","spatiotemporal feature descriptor","histograms of optical flow orientation and magnitude","optical flow information","nearest neighbor search","pattern classification","spatiotemporal information","HOFM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomalous event detection","spatiotemporal feature extraction","optical flow","histograms of oriented optical flow","smart surveillance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Histograms of Optical Flow Orientation and Magnitude to Detect Anomalous Events in Videos","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573163","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histograms of Optical Flow Orientation and Magnitude to Detect Anomalous Events in Videos","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7962a126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088074S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312722","isNumber":"7314530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312722","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7314530","articleId":"7314555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314558,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Ferreira Berriel","affiliation":["Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo Ferreira","lastName":"Berriel","id":"37085629992"},{"name":"Edilson de Aguiar","affiliation":["Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edilson","lastName":"de Aguiar","id":"37266878100"},{"name":"Vanderlei Vieira de Souza Filho","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo, Vitoria, ES, BR"],"firstName":"Vanderlei","lastName":"Vieira de Souza Filho","id":"37088467179"},{"name":"Thiago Oliveira-Santos","affiliation":["Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thiago","lastName":"Oliveira-Santos","id":"38273386800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7962-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7961-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5416"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1834"}],"articleNumber":"7314558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314558","abstract":"In this paper we present a particle filter-based lane marker tracking approach using a cubic spline model.

Traditional lane marker detection and tracking systems have limitations to properly detect curved roads and to use temporal information to better estimate and track lane markers. The proposed system works on a temporal sequence of images. For each image, one at time, it applies a sequence of steps comprising an inverse perspective mapping to correct for perspective distortions, and a particle filter to smoothly track the lane markers along time. The output of the system is a lane marker generated by a cubic spline interpolation scheme to fit a wider range of lanes. Our system can run in real applications and it was validated with various road and traffic conditions. As a result, it achieves a high precision (98.13%) and a small error (0.0143 meters).","doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.15","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312722/7314530/07314558.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Filter-Based Lane Marker Tracking Approach Using a Cubic Spline Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Splines (mathematics)","Roads","Cameras","Vehicles","Distortion","Standards","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","interpolation","object detection","object tracking","particle filtering (numerical methods)","splines (mathematics)","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filter-based lane marker tracking approach","lane marker detection","marked roads","monocular camera","temporal image sequence","inverse perspective mapping","cubic spline interpolation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["lane marker tracking","particle filter","cubic splines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Particle Filter-Based Lane Marker Tracking Approach Using a Cubic Spline Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314558/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573153","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Filter-Based Lane Marker Tracking Approach Using a Cubic Spline Model","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"7962a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054667S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312722","isNumber":"7314530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312722","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7314530","articleId":"7314558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7314574,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Teixeira Lopes","affiliation":["Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andre Teixeira","lastName":"Lopes","id":"37085663738"},{"name":"Edilson de Aguiar","affiliation":["Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edilson","lastName":"de Aguiar","id":"37266878100"},{"name":"Thiago Oliveira-Santos","affiliation":["Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thiago","lastName":"Oliveira-Santos","id":"38273386800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7962-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7961-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5416"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1834"}],"articleNumber":"7314574","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":632},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314574","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Face recognition","Accuracy","Face","Image recognition","Databases","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avatars","computer animation","computer vision","convolution","face recognition","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial expression recognition system","convolutional networks","avatar animation","neuromarketing","machine learning","computer vision","image preprocessing operations","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial Expression","Convolutional Networks","Computer Vision","Machine Learning","Expression Specific Features"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.14","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312722/7314530/07314574.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","startPage":"273","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Facial Expression Recognition System Using Convolutional Networks","abstract":"Facial expression recognition has been an active research area in the past ten years, with a growing application area like avatar animation and neuromarketing. The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since different people can vary in the way that they show their expressions. And even an image of the same person in one expression can vary in brightness, background and position. Therefore, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of standard methods, like Convolutional Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional networks, and the most machine learning methods, achieve better accuracy depending on a given feature set. Therefore, a study of some image pre-processing operations that extract only expression specific features of a face image is also presented. The experiments were carried out using a largely used public database for this problem. A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented.

Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes.

In the proposed approach, geometric features are firstly extracted from the learning dataset. Then, the number of shape models to be learned is obtained by an unsupervised clustering algorithm. In the segmentation stage, different graphs with an omega-like shape are built around the detected face, related to each learned shape model. A path with maximal cost, related to each graph, defines a initial estimative of the head-shoulder contour. The final estimation is given by the path with maximum average energy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperformed the original model, which is based on a single shape model, learned in a more simple way.

First, we propose an RSS window scheme to gain less fickle RSS value. Second, we design Libra, a dynamic traffic control scheme based on realtime passive measurement. Libra limits the traffic of invader users and protects the normal users' priority of using the channel. Finally, the scheme is deployed on a pervasive AP with OpenWrt system, as an additional tool to enhance the WiFi security.

Live migration of virtual machines presents an effective method to realize load balancing and to optimize resources utilization. With the rapidly increasing scale of cloud data centers, traditional centralized migration strategy begins to show lack of scalability and reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed VM migration strategy based on a metaheuristic algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization. In our ACO-VMM Strategy, local migration agent autonomously monitors the resource utilization and launches the migration. At monitoring stage, it takes both the previous and current system condition into account to avoid unnecessary migrations. Besides, it adopts two different traversing strategies for ants in order to find the near-optimal mapping relationship between virtual machines (VMs) and physical machines (PMs). Experimental results show that ACO-VMM outperforms the existing migration strategies by achieving load balance of whole system, as well as reducing the number of migrations and maintaining the required performance levels.","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2015.41","publicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312673/7314625/07314707.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2015.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ACO-based Scheduling Strategy on Load Balancing in Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314707/","displayDocTitle":"An ACO-based Scheduling Strategy on Load Balancing in Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15573062","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314707/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ACO-based Scheduling Strategy on Load Balancing in Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"9295a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056232S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312673","isNumber":"7314625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312673","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7314625","articleId":"7314707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314708,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Zha","affiliation":["School of Mobile Information Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, P.R.

The so-called server consolidation is a technology that uses limited server resources to improve the resource utilization of cloud computing data centres. Virtualization technique provides a way to integrate physical machines with low usage efficiency, assigning the tasks of the over-utilized servers to other servers, in order to achieve load balancing. However, due to the huge number of cloud servers, the consolidation problem is proved to be a NP-hard allocation problem. In this paper, the server consolidation allocation problem is taken as a three dimensional bin packing problem, and a hybrid genetic heuristic algorithm is proposed for addressing the limited server resource allocation problem. The experimental results show the high performance of the proposed method compared with the existing method.","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2015.43","startPage":"370","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2015.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314625","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Ninth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312673/7314625/07314708.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Server Consolidation Based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314708/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Server Consolidation Based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314708/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15573087","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Server Consolidation Based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"9295a370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078105S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312673","isNumber":"7314625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7314625","articleId":"7314708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7314784,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Sun Keel","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Min-Sun","lastName":"Keel","id":"38019728300"},{"name":"Elyse Rosenbaum","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Elyse","lastName":"Rosenbaum","id":"37068553500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5853-7273-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0739-5159"}],"articleNumber":"7314784","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":646},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314784","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharges","Receivers","Bandwidth","Inductance","Parasitic capacitance","Resistors","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","electrostatic discharge","hazards","magnetic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed wireline receivers","CDM-reliable T-coil techniques","inherent CDM hazard","T-coil circuits","magnetic coupling","inductance halving","ESD","voltage overshoot","bandwidth degradation"]}],"abstract":"An inherent CDM hazard exists in T-coil circuits due to magnetic coupling.

Compared with its time-domain diversity combining (TDDC) counterpart, the FDDC receiver is capable of more effectively exploiting the frequency selectivity of the channel to further improve the detection performance, which is proved by postcombining signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis. An enhanced version of the FDDC receiver, which is called eFDDC, is also proposed subsequently. It allows for optimal selection among multiple sets of candidate symbol vectors based on signum matrix estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed FDDC and eFDDC receivers outperform the TDDC receiver. With a sufficient number of candidate symbol vector sets, the eFDDC receiver even outperforms a kind of iterative receiver, which is known to have superior performance in current literature, yet the complexity of eFDDC is lower due to the avoidance of matrix inversion. Those facts suggest that the FDDC and eFDDC receivers are strong receiver candidates for the ACO-OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7305892/07314858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2496865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2496865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Diversity Combining Receiver for ACO-OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Frequency-domain analysis","OFDM","Time-domain analysis","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Computational comlexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","ACO-OFDM system","iterative receiver","signum matrix estimation","symbol vectors","optimal selection","SNR analysis","signal-to-noise-ratio analysis","frequency selectivity","FDDC receiver","frequency domain diversity combining receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ACO-OFDM","Diversity Combining","Symbol Detection","Candidate Selection","Computational Complexity"]},{"kwd":["Asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM)","diversity combining","symbol detection","candidate selection","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Diversity Combining Receiver for ACO-OFDM System","volume":"7","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7314858/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15645437","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","externalId":"7802510","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jiangsu NSF","grantNumber":"BK20140646"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61571105, 61501109 and 61223001"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2013AA013601"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Frequency-Domain Diversity Combining Receiver for ACO-OFDM System","sourcePdf":"jphot-dang-2496865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066542S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7305892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7305892","articleId":"7314858","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314860,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Ta Hsu","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7401148/7314860/hsu-2496621-small.gif","p":["Li-Ta Hsu (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","He was a Visiting Ph.D. Student with the Faculty of Engineering, University College London, London, U.K., in 2012.

However, it still suffers from the low availability due to the insufficient number of satellites. We develop a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, which is carried in the pedestrian's trousers. This PDR is capable of not only providing continues solutions but also indicating the pedestrian motions.

In this paper, a multiuser VLC system utilizing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated. Since the distances of the multiple transmitter-receiver links are different, their temporal delays are also different, resulting in complex channel gain and phase differences when transformed to the frequency domain. For each subcarrier in OFDM, the corresponding precoding matrix is calculated in the frequency domain to eliminate multiuser interference. Phase information in the frequency domain is first considered, where complex, instead of real, channel matrices are used for precoding, which reduces the channel correlation and achieves better performance. Moreover, minimum dc bias, unified dc bias, and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM-based schemes are proposed to generate real-valued nonnegative signals for intensity modulation, and their performances are validated via simulations with zero forcing and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) precoding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2497224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2497224","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7305892/07314864.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO-OFDM for Visible Light Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO-OFDM for Visible Light Communications","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15582832","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","externalId":"7904911","htmlLink":"/document/7314864/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271266"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Visible Light Communication System Key Laboratory","grantNumber":"ZDSYS20140512114229398"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Wireless over Visible Light Communication Technology Engineering Laboratory","grantNumber":"SDRC[2012]No.1440"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Peacock Plan","grantNumber":"1108170036003286"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multiuser MIMO-OFDM for Visible Light Communications","sourcePdf":"jphot-wang-2497224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130152S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7305892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7305892","articleId":"7314864","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7314866,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7314866/wang-2496944-small.gif","p":["Ting Wang (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the degrees and master\u2019s degree with the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety.

As a part of array signal processing, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation is of vital importance to obtain directional information of sources and to enable the 3-D beamforming. In this paper, the performance of DoA estimation for massive MIMO systems is analyzed and compared using a low complexity algorithm. To be specific, 2-D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (U-ESPRIT) algorithm is studied to jointly estimate elevation and azimuth information, and uniform rectangular array is selected to represent massive MIMO systems. The simulation results indicate that the U-ESPRIT algorithm works well for the massive MIMO systems. The performance has been evaluated with various types of antenna configuration and source numbers. Finally, the array resolution is adopted to analyze the performance of elevation and azimuth estimation and how to choose the appropriate antenna array configuration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07314866.pdf","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2496944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2496944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimension Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Array resolution","Two-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimension direction-of-arrival estimation","DoA estimation","massive MIMO systems","wireless communication networks","multiple-input multiple-output systems","network capacity","array signal processing","3D beamforming","low complexity algorithm","2D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques","U-ESPRIT algorithm","elevation information","azimuth information","uniform rectangular array","source numbers","antenna array configuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DoA estimation","Unitary ESPRIT","Massive MIMO","Array Resolution"]},{"kwd":["DoA estimation","unitary ESPRIT","massive MIMO","array resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimension Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7314866/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15638743","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222105"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Key Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A706"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Key Project","grantNumber":"D151100000115004"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Base Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2015JM6320"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501020"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015RC025 and 2014JBZ021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2014ZZ03 and RCS2015ZQ003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Two-Dimension Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-ai-2496944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07677S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7314866","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314869,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Yan Wong","affiliation":["Transmission Technology Research Department, Huawei Technologies, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"p":["Chi Yan Wong received the B.Sc. degree in physics (first class Hons.)\n from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2005, the M.Phil. degree in physics from the\n University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Chinese\n University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013.

Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional fixed-downtilt systems with equal power allocation, and waterfilling power allocation, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7412801/07314874.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2496954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2496954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Sum-Rate Optimization for Multicell Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Coordinated Tilt Adaptation and Game Theory Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","MIMO","Resource management","Antennas","Interference","Fading","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","optimisation","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network sum-rate optimization","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","multicell massive MIMO downlink","coordinated tilt adaptation","game theory","pilot contamination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO system","coordinated tilt adaptation","game theory"]},{"kwd":["Massive MIMO system","coordinated tilt adaptation","game theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Network Sum-Rate Optimization for Multicell Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Coordinated Tilt Adaptation and Game Theory Approach","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7314874/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15802493","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Sum-Rate Optimization for Multicell Massive MIMO Downlink Based on Coordinated Tilt Adaptation and Game Theory Approach","sourcePdf":"lwc-teh-2496954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044418S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7412801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7412801","articleId":"7314874","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314877,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Mavridou","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical, and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7369997/7314877/mavri-2496619-small.gif","p":["Marina Mavridou was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1985.

In particular, selecting the most discriminative features that accurately and concisely describe complex morphological patterns in image patches improves correspondence detection, which in turn improves image registration accuracy. Furthermore, since more and more imaging modalities are being invented to better identify morphological changes in medical imaging data, the development of deformable image registration method that scales well to new image modalities or new image applications with little to no human intervention would have a significant impact on the medical image analysis community. To address these concerns, a learning-based image registration framework is proposed that uses deep learning to discover compact and highly discriminative features upon observed imaging data. Specifically, the proposed feature selection method uses a convolutional stacked autoencoder to identify intrinsic deep feature representations in image patches. Since deep learning is an unsupervised learning method, no ground truth label knowledge is required. This makes the proposed feature selection method more flexible to new imaging modalities since feature representations can be directly learned from the observed imaging data in a very short amount of time. Using the LONI and ADNI imaging datasets, image registration performance was compared to two existing state-of-the-art deformable image registration methods that use handcrafted features. To demonstrate the scalability of the proposed image registration framework, image registration experiments were conducted on 7.0-T brain MR images. In all experiments, the results showed that the new image registration framework consistently demonstrated more accurate registration results when compared to state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2496253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7493713/07314894.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2496253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1505","endPage":"1516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable High-Performance Image Registration Framework by Unsupervised Deep Feature Representations Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Scalable High-Performance Image Registration Framework by Unsupervised Deep Feature Representations Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314894/","volume":"63","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7314894/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","pubMedId":"26552069","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000071","fundingName":"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development","grantNumber":"1R21HD081467"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable High-Performance Image Registration Framework by Unsupervised Deep Feature Representations Learning","sourcePdf":"tbme-wu-2496253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088476S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7493713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"7493713","articleId":"7314894","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":7314897,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7314897/shihe-2496948-small.gif","p":["Shiwen He (M\u201914) received the M.S. degree from Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, China, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.

Our goal is to maximize the utility function defined as the ratio between the system weighted sum rate and the total power consumption subject to the users' quality of service requirements and per-base-station (BS) power constraints. The considered problem is nonconvex and its objective is in a fractional form. To circumvent this problem, we first resort to an virtual uplink formulations of the the primal problem by introducing an auxiliary variable and applying the uplink-downlink duality theory. By exploiting the analytic structure of the optimal beamformers in the dual uplink problem, an efficient algorithm is then developed to solve the considered problem. Furthermore, to reduce further the exchange overhead between coordinated BSs in a large-scale antenna system, an effective coordinated power allocation solution only based on statistical channel state information is reached by deriving the asymptotic optimization problem, which is used to obtain the power allocation in a long-term timescale. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and show that both the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency can be simultaneously improved over traditional downlink coordinated schemes, especially in the middle-high transmit power region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell System: Duality-Based Algorithm Design and Massive MIMO Transition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2496948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07314897.pdf","startPage":"4920","endPage":"4935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2496948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell System: Duality-Based Algorithm Design and Massive MIMO Transition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7314897/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677254","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A703"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471120, 61422105, 61531011 and 61372101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20130019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell System: Duality-Based Algorithm Design and Massive MIMO Transition","sourcePdf":"tcomm-huang-2496948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149408S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7314897","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314898,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Pereyra","affiliation":["University of Bristol, School of Mathematics, University Walk, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7406776/7314898/7314898-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcelo Pereyra (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the M.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from both ITBA, Argentina, and INSA Toulouse, France, in June 2009, the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and control theory from INSA Toulouse in September 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, University of Toulouse, in July 2012.

SP methods are now expected to deal with ever more complex models, requiring ever more sophisticated computational inference techniques. This has driven the development of statistical SP methods based on stochastic simulation and optimization. Stochastic simulation and optimization algorithms are computationally intensive tools for performing statistical inference in models that are analytically intractable and beyond the scope of deterministic inference methods. They have been recently successfully applied to many difficult problems involving complex statistical models and sophisticated (often Bayesian) statistical inference techniques. This survey paper offers an introduction to stochastic simulation and optimization methods in signal and image processing. The paper addresses a variety of high-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as well as deterministic surrogate methods, such as variational Bayes, the Bethe approach, belief and expectation propagation and approximate message passing algorithms. It also discusses a range of optimization methods that have been adopted to solve stochastic problems, as well as stochastic methods for deterministic optimization. Subsequently, areas of overlap between simulation and optimization, in particular optimization-within-MCMC and MCMC-driven optimization are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2496908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7406776/07314898.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2496908","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/7406776/7314898-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Stochastic Simulation and Optimization Methods in Signal Processing","volume":"10","issue":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314898/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786079","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314898/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004794","fundingName":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","grantNumber":"2015OPTIMISME"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF- 1018368 and CCF-1218754"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","grantNumber":"ANR- 11-IDEX-0002-02, ANR-11-L ABX-0040-CIMI, ANR-12- BS03-003 and ANR-13- BS-03-0006-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IEF / 624502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/D063485/1 and EP/J015180/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0479"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Survey of Stochastic Simulation and Optimization Methods in Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-pereyra-2496908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.2713S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7406776","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7406776","articleId":"7314898","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7314899,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Ficocelli","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA","Autonomous Systems and Biomechatronics Laboratory, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7314899/ficoc-2492999-small.gif","p":["Maurizio Ficocelli received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2008.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the University of Toronto, and SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA.

This paper focuses on developing effective emotion-based assistive behavior for a socially assistive robot intended for natural human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios with explicit social and assistive task functionalities. In particular, in this paper, a unique emotional behavior module is presented and implemented in a learning-based control architecture for assistive HRI. The module is utilized to determine the appropriate emotions of the robot to display, as motivated by the well-being of the person, during assistive task-driven interactions in order to elicit suitable actions from users to accomplish a given person-centered assistive task. A novel online updating technique is used in order to allow the emotional model to adapt to new people and scenarios.

However, due to each vehicle being assigned with different transport missions (with different origins, destinations, and delivery times), platoons should be formed, split, and merged along the highways, and vehicles have to drive solo sometimes. In this paper, we study how two or more scattered vehicles can cooperate to form platoons in a fuel-efficient manner. We show that when forming platoons on the fly on the same route and not considering rerouting, the road topography has a negligible effect on the coordination decision. With this, we then formulate an optimization problem when coordinating two vehicles to form a platoon. We propose a coordination algorithm to form platoons of several vehicles that coordinates neighboring vehicles pairwise. Through a simulation study with detailed vehicle models and real road topography, it is shown that our approach yields significant fuel savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314925/","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874628","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heavy-Duty Vehicle Platoon Formation for Fuel Efficiency","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scania CV AB"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"VINNOVA","grantNumber":"2011-01144"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Project COMPANION"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004063","fundingName":"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Integrated Transport Research Lab"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heavy-Duty Vehicle Platoon Formation for Fuel Efficiency","sourcePdf":"tits-liang-2492243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143152S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7442200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7442200","articleId":"7314925","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7314926,"authors":[{"name":"Zacharie De Gr\u00e8ve","affiliation":["Electrical Power Engineering Unit, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Zacharie","lastName":"De Gr\u00e8ve","id":"37540715100"},{"name":"Jonathan Siau","affiliation":["CEDRAT S.A., Grenoble, France","Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Siau","id":"37085406439"},{"name":"G\u00e9rard Meunier","affiliation":["Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"G\u00e9rard","lastName":"Meunier","id":"37085386449"},{"name":"Jean-Michel Guichon","affiliation":["Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Michel","lastName":"Guichon","id":"37281885100"},{"name":"Olivier Chadebec","affiliation":["Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Chadebec","id":"37427562000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7314926","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Conductors","Surface impedance","Mathematical model","Finite element analysis","Magnetic cores","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","inductors","integral equations","skin effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed surface volume integral formula","high frequency coreless inductor modeling","electromagnetic system formula","conduction plus displacement currents","facet elements","volume mesh avoidance","skin effect","proximity effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational electromagnetics","Integral equations","Electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"kwd":["Computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic compatibility","integral equations"]}],"abstract":"An original integral formulation dedicated to the high-frequency modeling of electromagnetic systems without magnetic materials is presented. The total current density (i.e., conduction plus displacement currents) is approached by facet elements so that resistive, inductive, and capacitive effects are all modeled. Furthermore, the method avoids the volume mesh of the conductors, which is too dense at high frequencies, due to the skin and proximity effects appearing, e.g., in wound inductors. Surface impedance boundary conditions are employed to that end. The formulation is general and suitable for nonsimply connected domains. It is first compared with the finite-element method on an academic test case, and is then experimentally validated on a coreless wound inductor, using an impedance analyzer.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2497004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07314926.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2497004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed Surface Volume Integral Formulation for the Modeling of High-Frequency Coreless Inductors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314926/","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed Surface Volume Integral Formulation for the Modeling of High-Frequency Coreless Inductors","volume":"52","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786586","externalId":"7208904","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314926/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed Surface Volume Integral Formulation for the Modeling of High-Frequency Coreless Inductors","sourcePdf":"tmag-degreve-2497004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062333S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7314926","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314927,"authors":[{"name":"Penghui Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7430021/7314927/huang-2490582-small.gif","p":["\n\nPenghui Huang was born in Jiangxi, China.

As a modified Wigner-Ville distribution method, the SoWVD method can estimate the motion parameter without the search procedure, which achieves motion parameter estimation by Fourier transform operations in the 2-D frequency plane with respect to the slow time and the delay time. In addition, it can effectively recognize the cross terms based on multiple symmetrical properties of the peaks in the 2-D frequency domain.

CACC systems have been attracting significant attention from both academia and industry since connectivity between vehicles will become mandatory for new vehicles in the USA in the near future. In this paper, we review three basic and important aspects of CACC systems: communications, driver characteristics, and controls to identify the most challenging issues for their real-world deployment. Different routing protocols that support the data communication requirements between vehicles in the CACC platoon are reviewed. Promising and suitable protocols are identified. Driver characteristics related issues, such as how to keep drivers engaged in driving tasks during CACC operations, are discussed. To achieve mass acceptance, the control design needs to depict real-world traffic variability such as communication effects, driver behavior, and traffic composition. Thus, this paper also discusses the issues that existing CACC control modules face when considering close to ideal driving conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2483063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7394960/07314936.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2483063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","startPage":"491","endPage":"509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Communication, Driver Characteristics, and Controls Aspects of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Communication, Driver Characteristics, and Controls Aspects of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314936/","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7314936/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15754886","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1025652, CNS-1025649 and CNS-0917056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006234","fundingName":"Sandia National Laboratories","grantNumber":"10002282"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006112","fundingName":"Microsoft Research","grantNumber":"8300751"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Communication, Driver Characteristics, and Controls Aspects of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)","sourcePdf":"tits-dey-2483063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225536S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7394960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"7394960","articleId":"7314936","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7314946,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7314946/hu-small.gif","p":["Zhiyuan Hu (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical and computer engineering from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2014.","From 2007 to 2010, he was with Potentia Semiconductor Corp., and Power Integrations, Inc.

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and onboard inertial sensor integration are among the solutions for vehicle self-localization. However, as the main source in the integration, GNSS positioning performance is severely degraded in urban canyons because of the effects of multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations. These GNSS positioning errors also decrease the performance of the integration. To reduce the negative effects caused by GNSS positioning error, this paper proposes to employ an innovative GNSS positioning technique with the aid of a 3-D building map in the integration. The GNSS positioning result is used as an observation, and this is integrated with the information from the onboard inertial sensor and vehicle speedometer in a Kalman filter framework. To achieve stable performance, this paper proposes to evaluate and consider the accuracy of the employed GNSS positioning method in dynamic integration. A series of experiments in different scenarios is conducted in an urban canyon, which can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using various evaluation and comparison processes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2497001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493708","startPage":"4274","endPage":"4287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7493708/07314948.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GNSS/Onboard Inertial Sensor Integration With the Aid of 3-D Building Map for Lane-Level Vehicle Self-Localization in Urban Canyon","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314948/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"GNSS/Onboard Inertial Sensor Integration With the Aid of 3-D Building Map for Lane-Level Vehicle Self-Localization in Urban Canyon","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GNSS/Onboard Inertial Sensor Integration With the Aid of 3-D Building Map for Lane-Level Vehicle Self-Localization in Urban Canyon","sourcePdf":"tvt-gu-2497001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086692S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7493708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7493708","articleId":"7314948","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7314952,"authors":[{"name":"Congmin Fan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7314952/cofan-2496953-small.gif","p":["Congmin Fan (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree (with first class Hons.) in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2012.

The huge capacity gain mainly comes from the centralized and coordinated signal processing at the cloud server. However, full-scale coordination in a large-scale C-RAN requires the processing of very large channel matrices, leading to high computational complexity and channel estimation overhead. To tackle this challenge, we establish a unified theoretical framework for dynamic clustering by exploiting the near-sparsity of large C-RAN channel matrices. Based on this framework, we propose a dynamic nested clustering (DNC) algorithm that greatly improves the system scalability in terms of baseband-processing and channel-estimation complexity. With the proposed DNC algorithm, we show that the computational complexity (i.e., the computation time with serial processing) for the optimal linear detector is significantly reduced from O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), where N is the number of remote radio heads (RRHs) in the C-RAN.

In this scenario, which is referred to as Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), a fundamental challenge is the management of the handover process between macro, femto and pico cells. To limit the number of handovers and the signaling between the cells, it will hence be crucial to manage the user's mobility considering the context parameters, such as cells size, traffic loads, and user velocity. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model to characterize the performance of a mobile user in a HetNet scenario as a function of the user's mobility, the power profile of the neighboring cells, the handover parameters, and the traffic load of the different cells. We propose a Markov-based framework to model the handover process for the mobile user, and derive an optimal context-dependent handover criterion. The mathematical model is validated by means of simulations, comparing the performance of our strategy with conventional handover optimization techniques in different scenarios. Finally, we show the impact of the handover regulation on the users performance and how it is possible to improve the users capacity exploiting context information.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2496958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07314972.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2496958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Aware Handover Policies in HetNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Handover Policies in HetNets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314972/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15837500","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314972/","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A Novel Approach to Wireless Networking based on Cognitive Science and Distributed Intelligence"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002803","fundingName":"Fondazione CaRiPaRo"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"framework Progetto di Eccellenza 2012"},{"fundingName":"13th IEEE IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Aware Handover Policies in HetNets","sourcePdf":"twc-pappalardo-2496958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106705S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7314972","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7314973,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Feng","id":"37405918100"},{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"},{"name":"Ning Ge","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Ge","id":"37337989900"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7314973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1064},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Antenna arrays","Yttrium","Programming","Optimization","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","cellular radio","energy conservation","mathematical programming","matrix algebra","radio transmitters","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed antenna systems","optimal energy-efficient power allocation","imperfect channel state information","radio transmitter","CSI acquisition","energy-efficiency maximization","nonconvex fractional programming problem","random matrix theory","nonlinear fractional programming","saddle-point theory","optimal spectral efficiency","5G networks","cellular networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed antenna system (DAS)","energy efficiency (EE)","power allocation","spectral efficiency (SE)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314973","abstract":"In this paper, we study energy-efficient power allocation in distributed antenna systems (DASs). Unlike previous works that assumed perfect channel-state information (CSI) at the transmitter, we investigate a more practical case, where only the slowly varying large-scale CSI is known, to reduce the system overhead for CSI acquisition. Under a generalized DAS model, the power allocation problem for energy-efficiency (EE) maximization is formulated as a nonconvex fractional programming problem. Using the random matrix theory, the nonlinear fractional programming theory, and the saddle-point theory, we propose an iterative algorithm that achieves the global optimal solution. We also show that deploying the antennas in a distributed manner may enlarge the region where the optimal EE and the optimal spectral efficiency (SE) can be simultaneously achieved. Accordingly, we suggest the DAS-like way to densify the future 5G and beyond cellular networks to achieve EE and SE simultaneously.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07314973.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2497140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2497140","startPage":"7759","endPage":"7763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Imperfect CSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314973/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Imperfect CSI","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314973/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"16306002","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201186"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61321061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-feng-2497140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071684S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7314973","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7314977,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Stavridis","affiliation":["Li-Fi Research and Development Centre, Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7314977/stavr-2496597-small.gif","p":["Athanasios Stavridis received the Diploma degree (M.Eng. equivalent) in computer engineering and informatics and the M.Sc. degree in signal processing and communication systems from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, and the Ph.D. degree in digital communications from The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2006, 2008, and 2015, respectively.

MSR-SM is a closed-loop transmission scheme, which applies the concept of multistream space modulation at the receiver side. An accurate mathematical framework for the evaluation of the Bit Error Rate (BER) is proposed. In addition, the diversity order and coding gain of the new architecture are derived. Note that the proposed analytical framework takes into account both the small-scale fading and the system topology, and is directly applicable to the conventional MIMO broadcast channel. Compared with the state-of-the-art MIMO transmission in the broadcast channel, it is mathematically shown that MSR-SM achieves the same diversity order and a better coding gain, in the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, the proposed mathematical framework and the new findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"15","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15837545","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7314977/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multistream Receive Spatial Modulation in the MIMO Broadcast Channel","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the FP7-PEOPLE ITN-GREENET","grantNumber":"264759"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC under Established Career Fellowship","grantNumber":"EP/K008757/1"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multistream Receive Spatial Modulation in the MIMO Broadcast Channel","sourcePdf":"twc-stavridis-2496597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148124S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7314977","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7314978,"authors":[{"name":"Zai Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7381741/7314978/7314978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zai Yang (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) was born in Anhui, China, in 1986.

This theory was then extended to the cases of partial/compressive samples and/or multiple measurement vectors via atomic norm minimization (ANM), known as off-grid/continuous compressed sensing (CCS). However, a major problem of existing atomic norm methods is that the frequencies can be recovered only if they are sufficiently separated, prohibiting commonly known high resolution. In this paper, a novel (nonconvex) sparse metric is proposed that promotes sparsity to a greater extent than the atomic norm. Using this metric an optimization problem is formulated and a locally convergent iterative algorithm is implemented. The algorithm iteratively carries out ANM with a sound reweighting strategy which enhances sparsity and resolution, and is termed as reweighted atomic-norm minimization (RAM). Extensive numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the advantageous performance of RAM with application to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Sparsity and Resolution via Reweighted Atomic Norm Minimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2493987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07314978.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2493987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Sparsity and Resolution via Reweighted Atomic Norm Minimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7314978/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15719686","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Ministry of Education - Singapore","grantNumber":"AcRF TIER 1 RG78/15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Sparsity and Resolution via Reweighted Atomic Norm Minimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-xie-2493987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08537S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7314978","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7314979,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Ramos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7343796/7314979/7314979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ignacio Ramos (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, in 2009, the M.S. degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA, in 2013, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder.","From 2009 to 2011, he was with the Power and Electronic Systems Department, Raytheon IDS, Sudbury, MA, USA, during which time he was involved in power systems for radars, dc\u2013dc converters, and renewable energy systems.

The converters are based on GaN transistor class-E power amplifiers (PAs) and rectifiers. Three topologies are presented, which are: 1) a PA and synchronous rectifier, requiring two RF inputs; 2) a PA and self-synchronous rectifier with a single RF input; and 3) a power oscillator with a self-synchronous rectifier with no required RF inputs. The synchronous 1.2-GHz class- E\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n converter reaches a maximum efficiency of 72% at 4.6 W. By replacing the RF input at the rectifier gate with a specific termination, a self-synchronous circuit demonstrates 75% efficiency at 4.6 W, with a maximum output power of 13 W at 58% efficiency. In the third topology, the PA is replaced by a power oscillator by providing correct feedback for class-E operation, resulting in a circuit requiring no RF inputs. This oscillating self-synchronous dc-dc converter is demonstrated at 900 MHz with an efficiency of 79% at 28 V and 12.8-W output power. Self-synchronous class-E transistor rectifier operation is analyzed theoretically in the time domain and validated with harmonic-balance simulations using an improved nonlinear model for a GaN HEMT. The simplified theoretical analysis provides a useful starting point for high-efficiency self-synchronous power rectifier design, which can, in turn, be extended to high-efficiency oscillating power inverter design.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2493519","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7343796/07314979.pdf","startPage":"4473","endPage":"4482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2493519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaN Microwave DC\u2013DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"GaN Microwave DC\u2013DC Converters","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15635467","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314979/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaN Microwave DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ramos-2493519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102678S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7343796","articleId":"7314979","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7314981,"authors":[{"name":"Dilip Bethanabhotla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7314981/betha-2496942-small.gif","p":["Dilip Bethanabhotla received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

Future deployment scenarios will involve dense heterogeneous networks, comprised of massive MIMO base stations with different powers, numbers of antennas and multiplexing gain capabilities, and possibly highly nonhomogeneous user density (hot-spots). In such dense irregularly deployed networks, it will be important to have mechanisms for associating users to base stations so that the available wireless infrastructure is efficiently used. In this paper, we consider the optimal user-cell association problem for massive MIMO heterogeneous networks and illustrate how massive MIMO can also provide nontrivial advantages at the system level. Unlike previous treatments that rely on integer program problem formulations and their convex relaxations, the user-cell association problem is formulated directly as a convex network utility maximization and solved efficiently by a centralized subgradient algorithm. As we show, the globally optimal solution is physically realizable, in that there exists a sequence of integer-valued associations approaching arbitrarily closely the optimal fractional association. We also consider simple decentralized user-centric association schemes, where each user individually and selfishly connects to the base station with the highest promised throughput. Such user-centric schemes where users make local association decisions in a probabilistic manner can be viewed as games and are known to converge to Nash equilibria. Surprisingly, as we show, under certain conditions, the globally optimal solution is close to these Nash equilibria. Such decentralized approaches are, therefore, attractive not only for their simplicity, but also because they operate near the system social optimum. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive simulations with realistic LTE-like network parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal User-Cell Association for Massive MIMO Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2496942","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07314981.pdf","startPage":"1835","endPage":"1850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2496942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal User-Cell Association for Massive MIMO Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7314981/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837553","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal User-Cell Association for Massive MIMO Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-bethanabhotla-2496942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124984S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7314981","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314982,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Congiu","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Villach, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7314982/congi-small.gif","p":["Andrea Congiu was born in Cagliari, Italy, in 1984.

Oversampling-dithering features of third-order \u0394\u03a3 modulators are used to increase the DPWM resolution during the converter nominal operation and, moreover, as the core key to compute the SI algorithm. A modified structure of a noise shaper is used to handle the resolution of the SI algorithm over a range of the desired frequencies during the nonparametric identification. The SI algorithm comprises two steps: the first processing step extracts the resonant frequency, and the second extracts the ESR zero from the power spectrum density computation of the control feedback error. The SI method has been validated with different buck converter configurations, and has successfully been integrated and measured into a digitally controlled buck converters prototype for automotive safety application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7314982/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823193","volume":"31","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta \\Sigma$</tex-math></inline-formula> Dithering-Amplification-Based Identification Technique for Online SMPS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta \\Sigma$</tex-math></inline-formula> Dithering-Amplification-Based Identification Technique for Online SMPS","sourcePdf":"tpel-congiu-2496627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.362291S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7314982","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7314983,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqi Qin","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7314983/xiqin-2496961-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqi Qin (S\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer engineering from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

Existing DoF-based models differ in their interference cancellation (IC) behavior and many of them suffer from either loss of solution space or possible infeasible solutions. To overcome these limitations, a new DoF-based model, which employs an IC scheme based on node-ordering was proposed. In this paper, we apply this new DoF IC model to study a throughput maximization problem in a multihop MIMO network. The problem formulation involves joint consideration of flow routing and DoF allocation and falls in the form of a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Our main contribution is an efficient polynomial time algorithm that offers a competitive solution to the MILP through a series of linear programs (LPs). The algorithm employs a sequential fixing framework to obtain an initial feasible solution and then improves the solution by exploiting: 1) the impact of node ordering on DoF consumption for IC at a node and 2) route diversity in the network. Simulation results show that the solutions obtained by our proposed algorithm are competitive and feasible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07314983.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2496961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2496961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7314983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Flow Routing and DoF Allocation in Multihop MIMO Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","MIMO","Throughput","Interference","Resource management","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","integer programming","interference suppression","linear programming","MIMO communication","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint flow routing-DoF allocation","multihop MIMO networks","degree-of-freedom-based models","interference cancellation","node-ordering","DoF IC model","throughput maximization problem","mixed-integer linear programming","MILP","polynomial time algorithm","sequential fixing framework","route diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network throughput optimization","algorithm design","multi-hop MIMO networks"]},{"kwd":["Network throughput optimization","algorithm design","multi-hop MIMO networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Flow Routing and DoF Allocation in Multihop MIMO Networks","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7314983/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837537","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1343222, 1247830, 1064953 and 1102013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N000141310080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Flow Routing and DoF Allocation in Multihop MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-qin-2496961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131498S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7314983","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7314984,"authors":[{"name":"Jessica Burgner-Kahrs","affiliation":["Center of Mechatronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7339739/7314984/kahrs-small.gif","p":["Jessica Burgner-Kahrs (M'06) received the Diplom degree in\n computer science from Universt\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science\n (Dr.-Ing.) from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe.","From 2010 to 2012, she was with the Mechanical Engineering Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA, as\n a Research Associate.

Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications. We discuss relevant research in design, modeling, control, and sensing for continuum manipulators, and we highlight how this work is being used to build robotic systems for specific surgical procedures. We provide perspective for the future by discussing current limitations, open questions, and challenges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"31","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15647707","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314984/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Continuum Robots for Medical Applications: A Survey","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"BU2935/1-1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1427122 and IIS-1327597"},{"fundingName":"NSF/NASA/NIH/USDA/DOD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuum Robots for Medical Applications: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tro-burgnerkahrs-2489500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.49213S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7339739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"503","xplore-issue":"7339739","articleId":"7314984","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7314993,"authors":[{"name":"Sudha Lohani","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7314993/lohan-2496943-small.gif","p":["Sudha Lohani (S\u201914) received the Bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communication engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and the Master\u2019s degree in telecommunications engineering from Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

Given the limited total transmission time and available energy at the relay node, we propose different resource allocation frameworks for the proposed relay-based networks considering two different relay-based harvest-then-transmit scenarios. We first propose iterative algorithm to determine time and relay node power allocation (for downlink wireless charging and uplink data transmission/relaying) for both scenarios. We then perform joint optimal time and power allocation for one scenario. Resource allocation results show that most of the available resources (transmission time and relay node energy) are allocated for wireless energy harvesting which is similar to that observed for downlink simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in the existing literature.

A method is proposed in this paper for the separate examination of the impact of those two affecting factors, the change of load flow and dynamic interaction brought about by the DFIG, on the electromechanical oscillation modes of a power system. The method is developed on the establishment of a \u201cclosed-loop control system\u201d type of state space model of the power system where the DFIG is treated as the feedback controller. The established model unambiguously indicates that the impact of the DFIG can be examined separately: (1) With the DFIG being modelled as a constant power injection into the system, the impact of the load flow change brought about by the DFIG on the oscillation modes is determined; (2) The impact of the dynamic interactions introduced by the DFIG is estimated by calculating the contribution of the damping torque from the DFIG with its full dynamics being considered. Thus a more detailed examination on and deeper insight into the impact of grid connection of the DFIGs on power system small-signal angular stability is obtained by using the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7314994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7314994/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16230433","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Method to Examine the Impact of Grid Connection of the DFIGs on Power System Electromechanical Oscillation Modes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method to Examine the Impact of Grid Connection of the DFIGs on Power System Electromechanical Oscillation Modes","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2494082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093427S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7546948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7546948","articleId":"7314994","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":7315014,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Galve","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/7370014/7315014/galve-2497244-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Manuel Galve was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1991.

Developing interference suppression strategies is critical for suppressing the inter-tier interference between remote radio heads (RRHs) and a macro base station (MBS) in H-CRANs. In this paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in the contexts of collaborative processing and cooperative radio resource allocation (CRRA). In particular, interference collaboration (IC) and beamforming (BF) are proposed to suppress the inter-tier interference, and their corresponding performance is evaluated. Closed-form expressions for the overall outage probabilities, system capacities, and average bit error rates under these two schemes are derived. Furthermore, IC- and BF-based CRRA optimization models are presented to maximize the RRH-accessed users' sum rates via power allocation, which is solved with convex optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived expressions for these performance metrics for IC and BF are accurate, and the relative performance between IC and BF schemes depends on system parameters such as the number of antennas at the MBS, the number of RRHs, and the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold. Furthermore, it is seen that the sum rates of IC and BF schemes increase almost linearly with the transmit power threshold under the proposed CRRA optimization solution.","topic":"Emerging Cloud-Based

By means of devices memory replication, the IoT applications deployed at an LTE-integrated edge cloud can scale its computing and storage requirements to support different resource-intensive service offerings. Despite this potential, the massive number of IoT devices limits the LTE edge cloud responsiveness as the LTE radio interface becomes the major bottleneck given the unscalability of its uplink access and data transfer procedures to support a large number of devices that simultaneously replicate their memory objects with the LTE edge cloud. We propose Replisom; an LTE-aware edge cloud architecture and an LTE-optimized memory replication protocol which relaxes the LTE bottlenecks by a delay and radio resource-efficient memory replication protocol based on the device-to-device communication technology and the sparse recovery in the theory of compressed sampling. Replisom effectively schedules the memory replication occasions to resolve contentions for the radio resources as a large number of devices simultaneously transmit their memory replicas. Our analysis and numerical evaluation suggest that this system has significant potential in reducing the delay, energy consumption, and cost for cloud offloading of IoT applications given the massive number of devices with tiny memory sizes.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2497263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7467596/07315030.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7467596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2497263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","startPage":"327","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<small>Replisom</small>: Disciplined Tiny Memory Replication for Massive IoT Devices in LTE Edge Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315030","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/7467596/7315030-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"<small>Replisom</small>: Disciplined Tiny Memory Replication for Massive IoT Devices in LTE Edge Cloud","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315030/","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7315030/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985610","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1162296"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"<sc>Replisom</sc>: Disciplined Tiny Memory Replication for Massive IoT Devices in LTE Edge Cloud","sourcePdf":"jiot-abdelwahab-2497263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087634S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7467596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7467596","articleId":"7315030","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7315032,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong-Hua Pang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Fieldbus Technology and Automation of Beijing, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7315032/zpang-2497206-small.gif","p":["Zhong-Hua Pang (M\u201911) received the B.Eng. degree in automation and the M.Eng. degree in control theory and control engineering from Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2011.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from 2011 to 2014.

Network communication constraints, such as network-induced delay, packet disorder, and packet dropout in both the feedback and forward channels, are considered and further treated as the round-trip time (RTT) delay that is redefined. By using the packet-based transmission mechanism and the model-free adaptive control algorithm, a data-based networked predictive control method is proposed to actively compensate for the random RTT delay. The proposed method does not require any information on the plant model and depends only on the input and output data of the plant. A simple and explicit sufficient condition, which is related to the upper bound of the RTT delays, is derived for the stability of the closed-loop system. Additionally, a zero steady-state output tracking error can be achieved for a step reference input. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation and experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Based Predictive Control for Networked Nonlinear Systems With Network-Induced Delay and Packet Dropout","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2497206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07315032.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2497206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Data-Based Predictive Control for Networked Nonlinear Systems With Network-Induced Delay and Packet Dropout","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7315032/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697146","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203230, 61273104, 61333003, 61210012, 61290324 and 61174116"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005089","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4152014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Outstanding Young Scientist Award Foundation of Shandong Province of China","grantNumber":"BS2013DX015"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of North China University of Technology (NCUT)"},{"fundingName":"Excellent Youth Scholar Nurturing Program of NCUT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005291","fundingName":"Fund of Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network and Communication"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"2012005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004204","fundingName":"Fund of Key Laboratory of Embedded System and Service Computing, Ministry of Education, Tongji University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Based Predictive Control for Networked Nonlinear Systems With Network-Induced Delay and Packet Dropout","sourcePdf":"tie-pang-2497206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118317S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7315032","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7315034,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Hu Hao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/7585042/7315034/hao-2497226-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Hu Hao is currently working toward the PhD degree in the College\n of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China.

Computing such conformations, essential to associate structural and functional information with gene sequences, is challenging due to the high-dimensionality and rugged energy surface of the protein conformational space. As a consequence, the dimension of protein conformational space should be reduced to a proper level. In this paper, the high-dimensionality original conformational space was converted into feature space whose dimension is considerably reduced by feature extraction technique. And, the underestimate space could be constructed according to abstract convex theory. Thus, the entropy effect caused by searching in the high-dimensionality conformational space could be avoided through such conversion. The tight lower bound estimate information was obtained to guide the searching direction, and the invalid searching area in which the global optimal solution is not located could be eliminated in advance. Moreover, instead of expensively calculating the energy of conformations in the original conformational space, the estimate value is employed to judge if the conformation is worth exploring to reduce the evaluation time, thereby making computational cost lower and the searching process more efficient. Additionally, fragment assembly and the Monte Carlo method are combined to generate a series of metastable conformations by sampling in the conformational space. The proposed method provides a novel technique to solve the searching problem of protein conformational space. Twenty small-to-medium structurally diverse proteins were tested, and the proposed ACUE method was compared with It Fix, HEA, Rosetta and the developed method LEDE without underestimate information. Test results show that the ACUE method can more rapidly and more efficiently obtain the near-native protein structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method Using Abstract Convex Underestimation in Ab-Initio Protein Structure Prediction for Guiding Search in Conformational Feature Space","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2015.2497226","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/7585042/07315034.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2015.2497226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7585042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"September 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method Using Abstract Convex Underestimation in Ab-Initio Protein Structure Prediction for Guiding Search in Conformational Feature Space","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7315034/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2016","publicationDate":"1 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16356648","pubMedId":"26552093","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61075062 and 61573317"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY13F030008"},{"fundingName":"Public Welfare Project of Science Technology Department of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"2014C 33088"},{"fundingName":"Key-Key Discipline of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"20120811"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method Using Abstract Convex Underestimation in Ab-Initio Protein Structure Prediction for Guiding Search in Conformational Feature Space","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhang-2497226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114413S","chronDate":"September 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7585042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7585042","articleId":"7315034","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7315037,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7422867/7315037/gao-small.gif","p":["Jinyang Gao was born in Shanxi, China, on October 1, 1990.

Based on the Hertz contact theory, the design parameters of the two O-rings (i.e., wire diameter, hardness, and compression ratio) were optimized, and the optimized O-rings caused 17.6% torque loss at most. To take full advantage of the space in the inchworm mechanism, a novel hollow-cylinder-like 3-D receiving coil was proposed, which employed a combined ferrite core and measured 6 mm in inner diameter, 12.9 mm in outer diameter, and 11.5 mm in length. By selecting appropriate numbers of turns for the 3-D coils, the output power fluctuation of the receiving coil was minimized within a range of 485.7 to 1459.2 mW.

As a typical application, a myoelectric prosthetic hand is controlled by the sEMG signals of the amputee's residual muscles. To improve the dexterity of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, additional hand motion commands need to be classified. The more sEMG sensors are used, the more hand motion commands can be classified. However, the amputee's residual muscles are limited. In order to improve the practicability of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, it is critical to investigate the effective pattern recognition algorithms to deal with the sEMG signals detected by fewer sensors, while identifying as many hand motion commands as possible. Current pattern recognition algorithms for sEMG signals are challenged by limited recognition patterns and unsteady classification accuracy rates. To solve these dilemmas, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet neural network (WNN) algorithms to improve the pattern recognition effects of sEMG signals. In addition, the back propagation and gradient descent algorithms were utilized to train WNN. In this work, we only used three sEMG sensors to classify and recognize six kinds of hand motion commands. The maximum identification accuracy rate is 100%, and an average classification accuracy rate of the proposed WNN is 94.67%, which is substantially better than the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07315041.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2497212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2497212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"sEMG-Based Identification of Hand Motion Commands Using Wavelet Neural Network Combined With Discrete Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Accuracy","Prosthetic hand","Muscles","Wrist"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","discrete wavelet transforms","electromyography","gradient methods","medical signal processing","neural nets","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sEMG-based identification","hand motion commands","wavelet neural network","discrete wavelet transform","surface electromyogram signal","myoelectric prosthetic hand","amputee residual muscles","sEMG sensors","pattern recognition algorithm","DWT","WNN algorithm","back propagation","gradient descent algorithm","artificial neural network algorithm","ANN algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surface electromyogram signal","prosthetic hand","discrete wavelet transform","wavelet neural network","time-frequency domain"]},{"kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","prosthetic hand","surface electromyogram (sEMG) signal","time-frequency domain","wavelet neural network (WNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"sEMG-Based Identification of Hand Motion Commands Using Wavelet Neural Network Combined With Discrete Wavelet Transform","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7315041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15775298","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203339"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20110031120041"},{"fundingName":"Key Technologies R&D Program of Tianjin","grantNumber":"14ZCZDSY00008 and 14RCGFGX00848"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology","grantNumber":"14JCYBJC18300"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry","grantNumber":"[2012] 940"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"sEMG-Based Identification of Hand Motion Commands Using Wavelet Neural Network Combined With Discrete Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tie-duan-2497212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203164S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7315041","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7315042,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfang Jiao","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7315042/jjiao-2497204-small.gif","p":["Jianfang Jiao received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2014.","Since 2014, she has been a Lecturer with Bohai University, Jinzhou, China.

Partial least squares (PLS) is considered as an efficient tool for predicting and monitoring. However, due to the fact that PLS performs an oblique projection to input space, it is not suitable for quality-related fault detection. On the other hand, PLS is a static method which cannot be used in dynamic systems. In this paper, a dynamic least squares approach is developed by using the structure of auto-regressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) time-series model. Furthermore, augmented input matrix is decomposed into two orthogonal parts according to their correlations with output, such that quality-related fault detection can be utilized by designing appropriate statistics in two subspaces corresponding to the two parts. The proposed approached is simple and effective for systems with dynamic input and static output, which is a common case for most industrial processes. A numerical example and an industrial process simulator are applied to test the performance of the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2497204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7428980/07315042.pdf","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2632","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2497204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quality-Related Fault Detection Approach Based on Dynamic Least Squares for Process Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Quality-Related Fault Detection Approach Based on Dynamic Least Squares for Process Monitoring","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7315042/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837320","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61503039 and 61503040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quality-Related Fault Detection Approach Based on Dynamic Least Squares for Process Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tie-jiao-2497204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093058S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7315042","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7315045,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbo Yu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/7397004/7315045/yu-2497264-small.gif","p":["Jianbo Yu received the B.Eng. degree from the Department of Industrial Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Zhejiang, China, in 2002, the M.Eng. degree from the Department of Mechanical Automation Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, 2009.

The various defect patterns in wafer maps provide crucial information for assisting engineers in recognizing the root causes of the fabrication problems and solving them eventually. This paper develops a manifold learning-based wafer map defect detection and recognition system. In this system, a joint local and nonlocal linear discriminant analysis (JLNDA) is proposed to discover intrinsic manifold information that provides the discriminant characteristics of the defect patterns. An unsupervised version of JLNDA (called local and nonlocal preserving projection) is further developed to provide a monitoring chart for defect detection of wafer maps. A JLNDA-based Fisher discriminant is further put forward for online defect recognition without the modeling procedure of recognizers. Comparisons with other regular methods, principal component analysis, local preserving projection, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and local LDA, illustrate the superiority of JLNDA in wafer map defect recognition. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been verified by experimental results from a real-world data set of wafer maps (WM-811K).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","volume":"29","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15755205","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7315045/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wafer Map Defect Detection and Recognition Using Joint Local and Nonlocal Linear Discriminant Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51375290 and 71001060"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"13YZ002"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wafer Map Defect Detection and Recognition Using Joint Local and Nonlocal Linear Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsm-yu-2497264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095424S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"7397004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7397004","articleId":"7315045","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7315048,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Gao","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7315048/zhgao-2497201-small.gif","p":["Zhiwei Gao (SM\u201908) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering and automation and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in systems engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1987, 1993, and 1996, respectively.","Currently, he is a Reader with the Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K. His research interests include data-driven modeling, estimation and filtering, fault diagnosis, fault-tolerant control, intelligent optimization, large-scale systems, singular systems, distributed/decentralized estimation and control, renewable energy systems, power electronics and electrical vehicles, bioinformatics, and healthcare systems.","Dr. Gao is an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, and IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology.

Accordingly, this paper aims to develop an effective fault estimation technique to simultaneously estimate the system states and the concerned faults, while minimizing the influences from process/sensor disturbances. Specifically, an augmented system is constructed by forming an augmented state vector composed of the system states and the concerned faults. Next, an unknown input observer (UIO) is designed for the augmented system by decoupling the partial disturbances and attenuating the disturbances that cannot be decoupled, leading to a simultaneous estimate of the system states and the concerned faults. In order to be close to the practical engineering situations, the process disturbances in this study are assumed not to be completely decoupled. In the first part of this paper, the existence condition of such an UIO is proposed to facilitate the fault estimation for linear systems subjected to process disturbances. In the second part, robust fault estimation techniques are addressed for Lipschitz nonlinear systems subjected to both process and sensor disturbances. The proposed technique is finally illustrated by the simulation studies of a three-shaft gas turbine engine and a single-link flexible joint robot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","volume":"63","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15837325","publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315048/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unknown Input Observer-Based Robust Fault Estimation for Systems Corrupted by Partially Decoupled Disturbances","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"PGR scholarship"},{"fundingName":"E&E faculty in the University of Northumbria"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Renewed Fellowship","grantNumber":"GRO/1117303 STP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unknown Input Observer-Based Robust Fault Estimation for Systems Corrupted by Partially Decoupled Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tie-gao-2497201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105177S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7315048","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7315049,"authors":[{"name":"Tilak Rajesh Lakshmana","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7315049/laksh-2497223-small.gif","p":["Tilak Rajesh Lakshmana (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore, India, and the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, in 2002 and 2010, respectively.

The control signals comprising of CSI and the precoding weights can easily overwhelm the backhaul resources. Relative thresholding has been proposed to alleviate the burden; however, this is at the cost of reduction in throughput. In this paper, we propose utilizing the long-term channel statistics comprising of pathloss and shadow fading in the precoder design to model the statistical interference for the unknown CSI. In this regard, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP)-based precoder for maximizing the weighted sum rate is proposed. The accuracy of the solution obtained is bounded with the branch and bound technique. An alternative optimization framework via weighted mean square error minimization is also derived. Both these approaches provide an efficient solution close to the optimal, and also achieve efficient backhauling, in a sense that the precoding weights are generated only for the active links. For comparison, a stochastic approach based on particle swarm optimization is also considered.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07315049.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder Design With Incomplete Feedback for Joint Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315049/","displayDocTitle":"Precoder Design With Incomplete Feedback for Joint Transmission","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837541","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315049/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council VR","grantNumber":"621-2009-4555"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"framework of the FP7","grantNumber":"ICT-317669"},{"fundingName":"European Union"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder Design With Incomplete Feedback for Joint Transmission","sourcePdf":"twc-lakshmana-2497223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075853S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7315049","onlineDate":"02 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7315054,"authors":[{"name":"Yunzheng Tao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yunzheng","lastName":"Tao"},{"name":"Long Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Shang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Shang","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Zhi Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7315054","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4859},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","OFDM","Modulation","Receivers","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","channel bank filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal transmission","5G mobile communications","4G OFDM system","sum-capacity","spectral efficiency","multiple access schemes","waveform modulation technologies","nonorthogonal multiple access","NOMA","sparse code multiple access","SCMA","multiuser shared access","MUSA","pattern division multiple access","PDMA","filter-bank based multicarrier","FBMC","universal filtered multicarrier","generalized frequency division multiplexing","GFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-orthogonal transmission","multiple access","waveform modulation","survey","5G"]}],"abstract":"One key advantage of 4G OFDM system is the relatively simple receiver implementation due to the orthogonal resource allocation.

In the scheme, redundant sub-channels (RSC) are employed by CUs to tackle the outage problem caused by the PUs' reclaim of the spectrum and wireless fading effect in the transmission. Meanwhile, backup sub-channels (BSC) are arranged to help select sub-channels with better channel quality.

Hence, we propose a pilot reduction scheme based on the heterogeneous system configurations and the unique topology of this HetNet. The reusing of pilot sequences causes the presence of the contaminated channel state information (CSI) and results in receivers' Quality of Service (QoS) outage. With the contaminated CSI, we provide an energy-efficient beamforming based on minimizing the total power consumption while keeping the QoS constraints satisfied and restricting the QoS outage probability below a given specification. By applying the approach of Bernstein approximation and semi-definite relaxation, we transform the original intractable chance constrained program to a convex problem conservatively. Numerical results show that the average power consumption of the proposed beamforming for our pilot reduction scheme is close to that of the perfect CSI case. Since our scheme will greatly compress the length of pilot sequence especially for those highly densified network with large number of small cells, it will be crucially helpful to put such two-tier massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems into practice.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7315059","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7315009/07315059.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7315059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient beamforming for two-tier massive MIMO downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315059/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient beamforming for two-tier massive MIMO downlink","volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571641","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient beamforming for two-tier massive MIMO downlink","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067268S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","isNumber":"7315009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7315059","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7315064,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Chunxia Guo","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Chunxia","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7315064","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Sensors","Receivers","Games","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","game theory","interference","iterative methods","Monte Carlo methods","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative interference game scheme","cognitive radio hidden terminal scenario","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","CRN","full duplex mode","self-interference cancellation coefficient","optimized low collision probability","Monte Carlo simulation","iterative manner"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","hidden terminal","full duplex","interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7315064","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7315009/07315064.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7315064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Interference Game in cognitive radio hidden terminal scenario","abstract":"Hidden terminal problem in spectrum sensing is one of the most challenging problems in cognitive radio network (CRN).

The proposed ANN based controller has the ability to estimate wind speed by tracking the maximum power point (MPP) and the optimal rotor speed with very low error compared to the conventional MPPT methods. The algorithm is based on two series neural networks, one for wind speed estimation and the other for tracking maximum power point. The method demonstrates remarkable performance in estimating wind speed under rapidly changing wind conditions. It can also predict MPP accurately avoiding undesired oscillations around maximum power point. The algorithm does not require any mechanical sensor for wind speed measurement. Nonlinear time domain simulations have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers in terms of wind speed estimation and MPPT under different operating conditions. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the MPPT controller in tracking the maximum power point under rapidly changing wind conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICGET.2015.7315108","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Green Energy and Technology (ICGET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302497/7315071/07315108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Green Energy and Technology (ICGET)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGET.2015.7315108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient wind speed sensor-less MPPT controller using artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind speed","Artificial neural networks","Maximum power point trackers","Rotors","Wind turbines","Wind energy","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","neural nets","rotors","time-domain analysis","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind speed sensorless MPPT controller","artificial neural network","ANN","maximum power point tracking algorithm","optimal rotor speed","mechanical sensor","nonlinear time domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","MPPT","Renewable energy","Optimal rotor speed","Wind energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An efficient wind speed sensor-less MPPT controller using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","conferenceDate":"11-11 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586258","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient wind speed sensor-less MPPT controller using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074369S","chronDate":"11-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302497","isNumber":"7315071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302497","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7315071","articleId":"7315108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7315126,"authors":[{"name":"Salin Junsangsri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Salin","lastName":"Junsangsri","id":"37085699800"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37085354603"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37085609866"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8606-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0312-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7315126","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","1f noise","Resistance","MOSFET","Switches","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","flicker noise","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flicker noise impact evaluation","spike noise impact evaluation","phase change memories","simulation-based analysis","HSPICE simulation","array-level","cell-level","state switching phenomena","binary PCM memories","memory cell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flicker noise","Spike noise","Phase Change Memory (PCM)","Resistance","Frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315126","abstract":"This paper presents a simulation-based analysis of spike and flicker noise in a Phase Change Memory (PCM); this investigation is based on HSPICE simulation by taking into account cell-level (with its neighbors) and array-level considerations.

Recently it has been shown that it has memristive behavior as well. To efficiently support this claim, in this paper we use experimental data to characterize DSC cell and show that it exhibits memristor state behavior and developed a SPICE model. We use memristive DSC cells as sensing devices. This enables us to identify faulty cells in regular DSC. First, we present the model from the experimental data. A search algorithm is defined to identify the faulty components of the DSC array that fulfill the first requirement of a fault tolerant design. The proposed diagnosis method utilizes recently proposed fault detection solution for efficient testing of PV cells in the presence of faults. We divide the array into segments such that any faults is detectable thereby achieving high diagnosis accuracy. The proposed diagnosis method has been validated through SPICE simulation. Spare cells are to repair the faulty array.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2015.7315127","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304347/7315124/07315127.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2015.7315127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection and repair of DSC arrays through memristor sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection and repair of DSC arrays through memristor sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315127/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586298","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection and repair of DSC arrays through memristor sensing","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP002079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065256S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304347","isNumber":"7315124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304347","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7315124","articleId":"7315127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7315128,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunseung Han","affiliation":["Department of Semiconductor and Display Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunseung","lastName":"Han","id":"37085647706"},{"name":"Joon-Sung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Semiconductor and Display Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Joon-Sung","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292636200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8606-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0312-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7315128","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315128","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Reliability","Alpha particles","Organizations","Error analysis","Very large scale integration","Neutrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","integrated circuit reliability","integrated memory circuits","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric ECC organization","3D-memory","spare column utilization","processor-memory structure","3D-IC technology","die reliability","upper layer memory","bit-error rate"]}],"abstract":"3D-memory and processor-memory structures are promising applications of 3D-IC technology. With 3D integration, the effective density of memories can increase and the interconnect distance from processor to memory can be shortened. Due to their stacked structure, the upper dies behave as shields blocking outer particles from reaching lower dies, and it makes an error rate of the top layer largest among all layers. Therefore, it is important to improve reliability of upper dies in the 3D-ICs. A novel ECC scheme for 3D-memory to secure reliable operations by enhancing ECC capability of upper layer memories is introduced in this paper. The proposed scheme does not require additional redundancies. Instead, it utilizes unused spare columns of lower layer memories to store additional check-bits of upper layer memories. It forms an asymmetric ECC organization across different layers which enhances ECC capabilities in upper layers. Experimental results show that the proposed method can tolerate more than three times of a bit-error rate compared to the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2015.7315128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2015.7315128","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304347/7315124/07315128.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric ECC organization in 3D-memory via spare column utilization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric ECC organization in 3D-memory via spare column utilization","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586273","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315128/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric ECC organization in 3D-memory via spare column utilization","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP003015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068841S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304347","isNumber":"7315124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304347","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7315124","articleId":"7315128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7315129,"authors":[{"name":"Adedotun A.

However, the growing spectrum of reliability threats for such nano-scaled CMOS devices makes the integration of fault tolerance mandatory. The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is one widely used solver as it finds solutions typically faster compared to direct methods. Although this iterative approach is able to tolerate certain errors, latest research shows that the PCG solver is still vulnerable to transient effects. Even single errors, for instance, caused by marginal hardware, harsh environments, or particle radiation, can considerably affect execution times, or lead to silent data corruption. In this work, a novel fault-tolerant PCG solver with extremely low runtime overhead is proposed. Since the error detection method does not involve expensive operations, it scales very well with increasing problem sizes. In case of errors, the method selects between three different correction methods according to the identified error. Experimental results show a runtime overhead for error detection ranging only from 0.04% to 1.70%.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2015.7315136","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304347/7315124/07315136.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2015.7315136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-overhead fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-overhead fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586282","htmlLink":"/document/7315136/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-overhead fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP011022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099345S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304347","isNumber":"7315124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304347","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7315124","articleId":"7315136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7315143,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Yasin","affiliation":["New York University, Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Yasin","id":"37281534800"},{"name":"Bodhisatwa Mazumdar","affiliation":["New York University, Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Bodhisatwa","lastName":"Mazumdar","id":"37689648600"},{"name":"Sk Subidh Ali","affiliation":["New York University, Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Sk Subidh","lastName":"Ali","id":"38060850700"},{"name":"Ozgur Sinanoglu","affiliation":["New York University, Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Sinanoglu","id":"37273781800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8606-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0312-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7315143","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Integrated circuits","IP networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Reverse engineering","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated logic circuits","private key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic encryption security analysis","side-channel attack","IP piracy","reverse engineering attacks","secret key","IC encryption","differential power analysis attack","random-logic encryption technique","key bits","DPA-resistance","IC lock","strong logic encryption technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT.2015.7315143","endPage":"102","startPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304347/7315124/07315143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2015.7315143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security analysis of logic encryption against the most effective side-channel attack: DPA","abstract":"Logic encryption has recently gained interest as a countermeasure against IP piracy and reverse engineering attacks.

We present a differential power analysis attack against random and strong logic encryption techniques. The proposed attack is highly effective against random logic encryption, revealing more than 70% of the key bits correctly in 50% of the circuits. However, in the case of strong logic encryption, which exhibits an inherent DPA-resistance, the attack could reveal more than 50% of the key bits in only 25% of the circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315143/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315143/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15586301","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Security analysis of logic encryption against the most effective side-channel attack: DPA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security analysis of logic encryption against the most effective side-channel attack: DPA","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP018025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094504S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304347","isNumber":"7315124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304347","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7315124","articleId":"7315143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7315144,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Mozaffari-Kermani","id":"38274063800"},{"name":"Reza Azarderakhsh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Azarderakhsh","id":"37659099500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8606-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0312-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7315144","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Vegetation","Reliability","Transient analysis","Hardware","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","fault diagnosis","private key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable hash tree","post-quantum stateless cryptographic hash-based signature","multivariate-quadratic-equation","secret-key cryptography","code-based cryptography","lattice-based cryptography","Shor algorithm","quantum-computer discrete-logarithm algorithm","hash function","fault diagnosis methods","error detection post-quantum cryptographic architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error detection","hash-based signatures","postquantum cryptography","reliability"]}],"abstract":"The potential advent of quantum computers in coming years has motivated security researchers to start developing resistant systems capable of thwarting future attacks, i.e., developing post-quantum cryptographic approaches. Hash-based, code-based, lattice-based, multivariate-quadratic-equations, and secret-key cryptography are all potential candidates, the merit of which is that they are believed to resist both classical and quantum computers and applying \u201cShor's algorithm\u201d-the quantum-computer discrete-logarithm algorithm that breaks classical schemes-to them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose reliable and error detection hash trees for stateless hash-based signatures which are believed to be one of the prominent post-quantum schemes, offering security proofs relative to plausible properties of the hash function. We note that this work on the emerging area of reliable, error detection post-quantum cryptography, can be extended and scaled to other approaches as well. We also note that the proposed approaches make such schemes more reliable against natural faults and help protecting them against malicious faults. We propose, benchmark, and discuss fault diagnosis methods for this post-quantum cryptography variant choosing a case study for hash functions, and present the simulations and implementations results to show the applicability of the presented schemes. The presented architectures can be tailored for different reliability objectives based on the resources available, and would initiate the new research area of reliable, error detection postquantum cryptographic architectures.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2015.7315144","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304347/7315124/07315144.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2015.7315144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7315124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable hash trees for post-quantum stateless cryptographic hash-based signatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7315144/","displayDocTitle":"Reliable hash trees for post-quantum stateless cryptographic hash-based signatures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586294","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7315144/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable hash trees for post-quantum stateless cryptographic hash-based signatures","confLoc":"Amherst, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RP019009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079387S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304347","isNumber":"7315124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304347","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7315124","articleId":"7315144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7315147,"authors":[{"name":"Senwen Kan","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Austin Design Center, Austin, Texas"],"firstName":"Senwen","lastName":"Kan","id":"37085747534"},{"name":"Marco Ottavi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Ottavi","id":"37273889400"},{"name":"Jennifer Dworak","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Dworak","id":"37273928700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8606-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0312-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7315147","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Error correction codes","Trojan horses","Hardware","Polynomials","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","integrated circuit reliability","invasive software","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded SRAM security","error tolerance","hardware CRC","hardware obfuscation","hardware Trojan","soft error detection","SRAM soft error reliability","simulation data","production-worthy silicon development environment","cyclic redundancy codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7315147","abstract":"This paper proposes a scalable solution for obstructing and detecting malicious activity as well as erroneous events during mission mode operation of untrusted memories.

In this paper, we propose an improved wireless interconnect fabric that is able to achieve a similar error rate as traditional wireline channels as an effort to improve the overall reliability of WiNoCs. A novel transducer is designed to launch surface wave signals into a commercially available thin metal conductor coated with a low cost dielectric material to generate wireless signals with high signal strength. Experimental results show that, for a 60GHz center frequency, the proposed communication fabric can achieve an operational bandwidth of about 60GHz.

In this paper, the PNC technique is embraced for a TWR-free space optical (FSO) communication link for the full utilization of network resources. Such a scheme is particularly useful in situations where multiple nodes wish to exchange their information but there is no direct link between them. Compared with a traditional relay-assisted FSO link, the new scheme uses two phases in a round loop for a TWR transmissions link. We present simulation results for the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system considering the effect of both the atmospheric turbulence and the path loss using subcarrier intensity modulation binary phase shift keying (SIM-BPSK). The result shows that for the TWR FSO link based PNC technique under an atmospheric channel with a weak fading strength of 0.3, a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n is achieved at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ~25dB.","doi":"10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317412","publicationTitle":"2015 Internet Technologies and Applications (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Internet Technologies and Applications (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7304350/7317353/07317412.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer network coding with two-way relay free space optical communication link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317412/","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer network coding with two-way relay free space optical communication link","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586094","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317412/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer network coding with two-way relay free space optical communication link","confLoc":"Wrexham, UK","sourcePdf":"2051ITAPAPER.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07185S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7304350","isNumber":"7317353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7304350","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7317353","articleId":"7317412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7317433,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Amplifier is the most energy consuming element in a system, where more than 50% of the power produce is converted to heat energy as a waste. This situation gradually affects other devices in the transmitter system and can result to system performance reduction. A technique needs to be employed for dynamic amplification to counter balance the cost of energy consumption from base station and improve long battery life of the mobile equipment. This research presents a design of energy efficient balanced power amplifier to operate over the centre frequency of 2655MHz mobile LTE band, using Lateral MOSFET Transistor.

To meet these challenging requirements, the adoption of passive and semi-passive ultra-wideband (UWB) radio-frequency identification (RFID) appears a promising solution, which overcomes the limitations of standard Gen.2 ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID. The design and implementation of such systems pose several practical constraints, impacting the overall network architecture. In this paper, the main issues and challenging aspects for the design of a UWB-RFID network considering architectural and protocol choices are discussed in a unitary framework, and practical solutions, accounting for the presented issues, are proposed. Moreover, the possible integration of UWB-RFID with standard Gen.2 UHF-RFID is proposed as an interesting option, discussing architectural solutions, their advantages, and drawbacks.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7401148/07317485.pdf","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2497373","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2497373","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317485","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Backscatter","Radiofrequency identification","Synchronization","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radio direction-finding","radiofrequency identification","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive UWB RFID network","tag localization","Internet of Things","wireless sensor network","semipassive ultrawideband radiofrequency identification","Gen.2 ultrahigh frequency standard","UHF standard","protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","Internet of Things","UWB","sensors","localization"]},{"kwd":["RFID","Internet of Things","UWB","sensors","localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317485/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Passive UWB RFID for Tag Localization: Architectures and Design","accessionNumber":"15785780","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","publicationDate":"March1, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317485/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministerial PRIN Project GRETA","grantNumber":"2010WHY5PR"},{"fundingName":"H2020-EU.1.3.2 IF-EF Marie Curie Action MAPS","grantNumber":"659067"},{"fundingName":"European H2020 Project XCYCLE","grantNumber":"635975"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive UWB RFID for Tag Localization: Architectures and Design","sourcePdf":"jsen-decarli-2497373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153808S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7401148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7401148","articleId":"7317485","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7317490,"authors":[{"name":"Lav Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7475979/7317490/gupta-2495297-small.gif","p":["Lav Gupta received the B.S. degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India, and the M.S. degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 1978 and 1980, respectively.

These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2495297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2495297","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7475979/07317490.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of Important Issues in UAV Communication Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Survey of Important Issues in UAV Communication Networks","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16020664","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317490/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of Important Issues in UAV Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-gupta-2495297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218973S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7475979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"860","xplore-issue":"7475979","articleId":"7317490","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7317491,"authors":[{"name":"Eric M.

One application ideally suited to the analysis of single cells is photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). Using PAM, detailed submicrometer resolution images of single cells can be produced, with contrast dependent primarily on the optical absorption properties of the cell. A multiwavelength approach for targeting specific endogenous or exogenous chromophores can enhance cellular detail and resolve single organelles with contrast not possible with traditional optical microscopy. A quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signals acquired from single cells can provide insight into their anatomical, biomechanical, and functional properties. This information can be used to identify specific cells, or to enhance the understanding of biological processes at the single cell level.

This paper will outline the architecture options available to today's ship designer and will discuss the design implications and pitfalls inherent in the power system architecture selection, paying particular attention to the unique aspects of integrated power systems.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2480597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2480597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329673","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2284","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7329673/07317499.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Propulsion","Power system dynamics","Electric propulsion","Generators","Systems architecture","Energy storage","Electric vehicles","Design methodology","Propulsion","Microgrids","Hybrid power systems","Hybrid electric vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","marine propulsion","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated power system","propulsion system architecture","arrangement flexibility","superior reliability","survivability","advanced weapons","sensors warships","ship propulsion","microgrids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design engineering","hybrid power systems","marine vehicles","microgrids","power systems","ship propulsion"]},{"kwd":["Design engineering","hybrid power systems","marine vehicles","microgrids","power systems","ship propulsion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrated Power Systems\u2014An Outline of Requirements and Functionalities for Ships","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"103","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602363","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7317499/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317499/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Power Systems\u2014An Outline of Requirements and Functionalities for Ships","sourcePdf":"jproc-mccoy-2480597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056519S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7329673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7329673","articleId":"7317499","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7317500,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer and Electronic Information, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7404293/7317500/xiong-2497545-small.gif","p":["Jianbin Xiong (M\u201912) was born in Hunan, China, in 1976.

Energy harvesting from ambient energy sources can potentially reduce the dependence on the supply of grid or battery energy, providing many attractive benefits to the environment and deployment. However, unlike the conventional stable energy, the intermittent and random nature of the renewable energy makes it challenging in the realization of energy harvesting transmission schemes. Extensive research studies have been carried out in recent years to address this inherent challenge from several aspects: energy sources and models, energy harvesting and usage protocols, energy scheduling and optimization, implementation of energy harvesting in cooperative, cognitive radio, multiuser and cellular networks, etc. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey to lay out the complete picture of recent advances and future directions. To fill such a gap, in this paper, we present an overview of the past and recent developments in these areas and highlight a number of possible future research avenues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2016","volume":"18","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16020669","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317504/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Advances in Energy Harvesting Communications: Past, Present, and Future Challenges","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-008-035 and MOST 104-2221-E-008-045"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in Energy Harvesting Communications: Past, Present, and Future Challenges","sourcePdf":"comst-ku-2497324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.292302S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7475979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"319","xplore-issue":"7475979","articleId":"7317504","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7317506,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Azhar Ali Zaidi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["\nSyed Azhar Ali Zaidi is a Lecturer at the University of Engineering and \nTechnology Taxila, Taxila, Pakistan.

Among such signals, we consider 1-D sparse vectors, low-rank matrices, or compressible signals that are well approximated by one of these two models. In this context, we prove the estimation efficiency of a variant of Basis Pursuit Denoise, called Consistent Basis Pursuit (CoBP), enforcing consistency between the observations and the re-observed estimate, while promoting its low-complexity nature. We show that the reconstruction error of CoBP decays like M \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">- 1/4</sup>\n when all parameters but M are fixed. Our proof is connected to recent bounds on the proximity of vectors or matrices when (i) those belong to a set of small intrinsic \u201cdimension\u201d, as measured by the Gaussian mean width, and (ii) they share the same quantized (dithered) random projections. By solving CoBP with a proximal algorithm, we provide some extensive numerical observations that confirm the theoretical bound as M is increased, displaying even faster error decay than predicted. The same phenomenon is observed in the special, yet important case of 1-bit CS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7314997/07317511.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2497543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2497543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7314997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent Basis Pursuit for Signal and Matrix Estimates in Quantized Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Compressed sensing","Sensors","Sparse matrices","Complexity theory","Estimation","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","iterative methods","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consistent basis pursuit","quantized compressed sensing","1D sparse vector","low-rank matrix","basis pursuit denoising","CoBP","reconstruction error","Gaussian mean"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consistency","error decay","low-rank","quantization","quantized compressed sensing","sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Consistent Basis Pursuit for Signal and Matrix Estimates in Quantized Compressed Sensing","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15583565","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Walloon Region of Belgium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002661","fundingName":"Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent Basis Pursuit for Signal and Matrix Estimates in Quantized Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"lsp-jacques-2497543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065515S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","isNumber":"7314997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"32","articleId":"7317511","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317512,"authors":[{"name":"Quanzhong Li","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7406792/7317512/quali-2497345-small.gif","p":["Quanzhong Li received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), Guangzhou, China, both in information and communications engineering, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate transceiver design optimization problem for nonregenerative multiple-input multiple-output cognitive relay networks (CRNs) with TH precoding. In the CRN, a secondary user (SU) source, an SU relay and an SU destination employ a TH precoder, a relay precoder, and a linear equalizer, respectively. For scenario in which SUs know perfect channel state information (CSI) from SUs to primary users, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based suboptimal algorithm. Given TH precoder and relay precoder, we derive a closed-form optimal solution of linear equalizer. Given relay precoder, TH precoder can be found by convex optimization. Given TH precoder, we transform nonconvex relay precoder design problem into a difference of convex programming and propose a constrained concave convex procedure-based iterative algorithm to find its local optimum. For scenario in which SUs know imperfect CSI, the channel uncertainties are modeled by worst case model. We derive equivalent worst case interference power constraints and extend the proposed AO-based suboptimal algorithm to cope with the worst case interference power constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transceiver design with TH precoding outperforms linear transceiver designs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2497345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07317512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2497345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","startPage":"541","endPage":"553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786043","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317512/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472458, 61202498 and 61173148"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030311032, 2014A030313111 and 2014A030310374"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"15lgzd10 and 15lgpy15"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Innovation Project of the Education Department of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2497345-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09538S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7317512","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317513,"authors":[{"name":"Lisheng Fan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","School of Computer Science and Educational Software, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7317513/lifan-2497308-small.gif","p":["Lisheng Fan received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, the master\u2019s degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in communications and integrated systems from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2002, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

The secure data transmission from the secondary source to secondary destination is assisted by two decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Although the traditional opportunistic relaying technique can choose one relay to provide the best secure performance, it needs to continuously have the channel state information (CSI) of both relays, and may result in a high relay switching rate. To overcome these limitations, a secure switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol is proposed where only one out of the two relays is activated to assist the secure data transmission, and the secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the secure communication any longer. This security switching is assisted by either instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI. For these two cases, we study the system secure performance of SSSC protocol, by deriving the analytical secrecy outage probability as well as an asymptotic expression for the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region. We show that SSSC can substantially reduce the system complexity while achieving or approaching the full diversity order of opportunistic relaying in the presence of the instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2497308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2497308","startPage":"70","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07317513.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Switch-and-Stay Combining (SSSC) for Cognitive Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure Switch-and-Stay Combining (SSSC) for Cognitive Relay Networks","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15704916","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317513/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61372129, 61372078 and 61471229"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"NSF of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014A030306027"},{"fundingName":"National 973 Project","grantNumber":"2013CB336700"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2013D04"},{"fundingName":"Excellent Young Teachers in Higher Education Institutions of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"Yq2013070"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"KQCX20140509172609163"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen University","grantNumber":"00002501"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Switch-and-Stay Combining (SSSC) for Cognitive Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fan-2497308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148924S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7317513","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7317516,"authors":[{"name":"In\u00e9s Cart\u00f3n Llorente","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"In\u00e9s","lastName":"Cart\u00f3n Llorente","id":"37085820749"},{"name":"Wei Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fan","id":"38498486400"},{"name":"Gert F.

In particular, energy can be harvested from radio waves in the radio frequency spectrum. To ensure a reliable performance, energy prediction modelling is a key component for optimizing energy harvesting because it equips the harvesting node with adaptation to energy availability. We use two machine learning techniques, linear regression (LR) and decision trees (DT) to model the harvested energy using real-time power measurements in the radio spectrum. Numerical results show that LR outperforms DT by attaining minimum 85% prediction accuracy. These models will be useful for defining the scheduling policies of harvesting nodes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Radio frequency","Predictive models","Wireless communication","Power measurement","Energy harvesting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","energy harvesting","learning (artificial intelligence)","radio networks","regression analysis","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive modelling","RF energy","wireless powered communications","energy harvesting","wireless networks","battery change","radio waves","radio frequency spectrum","reliable performance","energy prediction modelling","harvesting node","energy availability","machine learning techniques","linear regression","LR","decision trees","DT","radio spectrum","real-time power measurements","scheduling policies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","energy prediction model","machine learning"]},{"kwd":["Energy harvesting","energy prediction model","machine learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2497306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7374754/07317517.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2497306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Modelling of RF Energy for Wireless Powered Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Modelling of RF Energy for Wireless Powered Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317517/","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317517/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697198","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"open project fund ICT1517"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004835","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Modelling of RF Energy for Wireless Powered Communications","sourcePdf":"lcomm-azmat-2497306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040314S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7374754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7374754","articleId":"7317517","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7317520,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chu","id":"37596188400"},{"name":"Jian-Xin Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085357695"},{"name":"Sha Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sha","lastName":"Luo","id":"37534749500"},{"name":"Yong-Xin Guo","affiliation":["National University of Singapore Suzhou Research Institute, Suzhou, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong-Xin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7317520","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4074},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A millimeter-wave filtering monopulse antenna array based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is proposed, manufactured, and tested in this communication. The proposed antenna array consists of a filter, a monopulse comparator, a feed network, and four antennas. A square dual-mode SIW cavity is designed to realize the monopulse comparator, in which internal coupling slots are located at its diagonal lines for the purpose of meeting the internal coupling coefficiencies in both sum and difference channels. Then, a four-output filter including the monopulse comparator is synthesized efficiently by modifying the coupling matrix of a single-ended filter. Finally, each SIW resonator coupled with those four outputs of the filter is replaced by a cavity-backed slot antenna so as to form the proposed filtering antenna array. A prototype is demonstrated at Ka band with a center frequency of 29.25 GHz and fractional bandwidth of 1.2%. Our measurement shows that, for the H-plane, the sidelobe levels of the sum pattern are less than -15 dB and the null depths of the difference pattern are less than -28 dB.

This paper considers the co-channel deployment of a macrocell overlaid with small cells. The small cell base stations (SBSs) harvest energy from environmental sources whereas the macrocell base station (MBS) uses conventional power supply. Given a stochastic energy arrival process for the SBSs, we derive a power control policy for the downlink transmission of both MBS and SBSs such that they can achieve their objectives [e.g., maintain the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR); at an acceptable level] on a given transmission channel. We consider a centralized energy harvesting mechanism for SBSs, i.e., there is a central energy storage (CES) where energy is harvested and then distributed to the SBSs. When the number of SBSs is small, the game between the CES and the MBS is modeled as a single-controller stochastic game and the equilibrium policies are obtained as a solution of a quadratic programming problem. However, when the number of SBSs tends to infinity (i.e., a highly dense network), the centralized scheme becomes infeasible, and therefore, we use a mean field stochastic game to obtain a distributed power control policy for each SBS. By solving a system of partial differential equations, we derive the power control policy of SBSs given the knowledge of mean field distribution and the available harvested energy levels in the batteries of the SBSs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317521/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677237","volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular Networks With Energy-Harvesting Small Cells as Stochastic Games","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular Networks With Energy-Harvesting Small Cells as Stochastic Games","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hossain-2497239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089029S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7317521","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7317522,"authors":[{"name":"Hucheng Sun","affiliation":["Research Center of Applied Electromagnetics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hucheng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085637215"},{"name":"Sheng Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291618100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7317522","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3284},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"In this communication, a reconfigurable feeding network is proposed for the design of a quad-polarization-agile antenna.

The high dimensionality, on the other hand, also causes computational difficulties when scaling up to large-scale video data. This paper makes three lines of contributions to learning to recognize actions using high dimensional representations. First, we reviewed several existing techniques that improve upon FV or VLAD in image classification, and performed extensive empirical evaluations to assess their applicability for action recognition. Our analyses of these empirical results show that normality and bimodality are essential to achieve high accuracy. Second, we proposed a new pooling strategy for VLAD and three simple, efficient, and effective transformations for both FV and VLAD. Both proposed methods have shown higher accuracy than the original FV/VLAD method in extensive evaluations. Third, we proposed and evaluated new feature selection and compression methods for the FV and VLAD representations. This strategy uses only 4% of the storage of the original representation, but achieves comparable or even higher accuracy. Based on these contributions, we recommend a set of good practices for action recognition in videos for practitioners in this field.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Training","Principal component analysis","Testing","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feature selection","image classification","vectors","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","Fisher vector","FV","vector of locally aggregated descriptor","VLAD","video data","image classification","feature selection","feature compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action recognition","empirical evaluations","feature selection and compression","transformations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2493538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7744634/07317527.pdf","startPage":"2978","endPage":"2990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7744634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2493538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Good Practices for Learning to Recognize Actions Using FV and VLAD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Good Practices for Learning to Recognize Actions Using FV and VLAD","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317527/","volume":"46","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317527/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16465627","pubMedId":"26552106","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422203, 61471235 and U1201255"},{"fundingName":"Chinese National 973","grantNumber":"2013CB329603"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Good Practices for Learning to Recognize Actions Using FV and VLAD","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wu-2493538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128149S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7317527","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317531,"authors":[{"name":"Md Mashud Hyder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7383348/7317531/hyder-2497232-small.gif","p":["Md Mashud Hyder received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Newcastle, Callaghan, N.S.W., Australia, in 2012.

It enables the base station (BS) to detect new subscriber stations (SS) willing to commence communication. It also enables the BS to estimate the uplink channel parameters of these SSs. Accurate estimation of channel parameters is crucial, as they ensure the uplink signals from all the SSs arrive at the BS synchronously at similar power levels. However, this detection and estimation problem turns out to be very challenging when multiple users initiate the synchronization procedure at the same time. We address this issue by exploiting the underlying sparsity of the estimation problem.

An inherent geometrical symmetry of a four-arm spiral antenna and feeding rearrangement are exploited to achieve the simultaneous transmit (TX) and receive (RX) functionalities without any time, polarization, or frequency multiplexing. The antenna is configured such that one arm-pair is used for TX and the other for RX. Thus, even though the two antennas are spatially separated by 90\u00b0, they still share the same aperture and the system is considered monostatic. Theoretical and computational studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach under ideal conditions as well as in the presence of feed network non-idealities. The experimental data indicate that isolation levels greater than 39.6-50 dB over multiple octaves are achievable with realistic components. To improve the TX and RX far-field patterns, the planar four-arm spiral aperture is grounded via resistor-loaded quadrifilar helix with the two-arm TX/two-arm RX feed arrangement preserved. Furthermore, to simplify the feed network and reduce the impact of hybrid imbalances, an impedance-transforming microstrip feed is integrated with each arm pair. Isolation > 37 dB and similar with high-quality measured and simulated TX/RX radiation patterns are obtained over the operating bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2497356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7369997/07317532.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2497356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7369997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Monostatic Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) Antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Monostatic Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) Antenna","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317532/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685597","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research (ONR)","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Monostatic Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-filipovic-2497356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061636S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7369997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7369997","articleId":"7317532","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":7317535,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292035200"},{"name":"Kun Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085472044"},{"name":"Yongtao Jia","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yongtao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085363387"},{"name":"Yuwen Hao","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yuwen","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085526322"},{"name":"Shuxi Gong","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Shuxi","lastName":"Gong","id":"37395065600"},{"name":"Y.

Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an important transport-layer protocol recommended by IETF to integrate different access medium (e.g., Cellular and Wi-Fi). This paper investigates the problem of mobile video delivery using MPTCP in heterogeneous wireless networks with multihomed terminals. To achieve the optimal quality of real-time video streaming, we have to seriously consider the path asymmetry in different access networks and the disadvantages of the data retransmission mechanism in MPTCP. Motivated by addressing these critical issues, this study presents a novel quAlity-Driven MultIpath TCP (ADMIT) scheme that integrates the utility maximization based Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding and rate allocation. We develop an analytical framework to model the MPTCP-based video delivery quality over multiple communication paths. ADMIT is able to effectively integrate the most reliable access networks with FEC coding to minimize the end-to-end video distortion. The performance of ADMIT is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving H.264 video streaming. Experimental results show that ADMIToutperforms the reference transport protocols in terms of video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), end-to-end delay, and goodput. Thus, we recommend ADMIT for streaming high-quality mobile video in heterogeneous wireless networks with multihomed terminals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7530934/07317538.pdf","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2497238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2497238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streaming High-Quality Mobile Video with Multipath TCP in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Delays","Forward error correction","Encoding","Wireless networks","Packet loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","forward error correction","mobile computing","radio access networks","telecommunication terminals","transport protocols","video communication","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality mobile video streaming","heterogeneous wireless networks","wireless infrastructures","bandwidth aggregation","concurrent video transmission","heterogeneous access networks","transport-layer protocol","IETF","mobile video delivery","MPTCP","multihomed terminals","optimal real-time video streaming quality","path asymmetry","data retransmission","quality-driven multipath TCP scheme","ADMIT scheme","utility maximization-based forward error correction coding","FEC coding","rate allocation","communication paths","end-to-end video distortion minimization","performance evaluation","semiphysical emulations","Exata","H.264 video streaming","video PSNR","peak signal-to-noise ratio","end-to-end delay","video goodput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quality-driven","multipath TCP","real-time mobile video","heterogeneous wireless networks","forward error correction","multihomed communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Streaming High-Quality Mobile Video with Multipath TCP in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","volume":"15","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7317538/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191286","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61132001"},{"fundingName":"National High-tech R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2013AA102301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0592"},{"fundingName":"Project of New Generation Broadband Wireless Network","grantNumber":"2014ZX03006003"},{"fundingName":"Multi-plAtform Game Innovation Centre (MAGIC)"},{"fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"IDM"},{"fundingName":"Interactive & Digital Media Programme Office"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001457","fundingName":"Media Development Authority"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streaming High-Quality Mobile Video with Multipath TCP in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-wu-2497238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18173S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7317538","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317547,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Ge Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7353235/7317547/li-small.gif","p":["Hong Ge Li (M\u2019 09) received the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate\n School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2005.","From 2006 to 2008, he was an Assistant Professor of Tohoku University, Department of Bioengineering and Robotics.

The conventional model predictive control (MPC) strategies for the MMC are not practical due to their substantial calculation requirements, especially under high number of voltage levels. To solve this problem, a fast MPC strategy combined with a submodule (SM)-voltage sorting balancing method is proposed based on the discrete mathematical model derived for the MMC in this paper. By optimizing the implementation of the control objectives and simplifying the rolling optimization, the proposed strategy is simpler to expand to a system with larger number of SMs, with the amount of calculation reduced and the advantages of the conventional MPC algorithm reserved. In addition, the proposed control can minimize the dv/dt of the output voltages. Both steady-state and transient performances are evaluated by a down-scaled three-phase MMC prototype under various experimental conditions, which validates the proposed fast MPC strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Sorting","Voltage control","Mathematical model","Switches","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control

The superior performance of the SAMOO is verified by comparing it with conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms in a test function.

However, the lack of prior information about anomaly targets and the complex spectral mixture result in a challenge for robust background feature extraction. Can we solve the anomaly detection problem other than with background feature extraction? Relative to anomalies, the background spectral signal is usually stable and slowly varying. In view of this point, slowly varying background analysis is introduced into anomaly detection in this paper. The desired background signals are obtained through a generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem based on the original data and the differential image. The extracted signals are then combined with a Mahalanobis distance metric to construct the detection estimation. Different data processing procedures and signal extraction patterns are respectively formulated to construct different versions of the slowly varying background-signal-based detector. The performances of the proposed methods were validated on both synthetic and real hyperspectral data. The experimental results reveal that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art anomaly detectors, with superior receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area-under-ROC values, and background-target separation. The sensitivity of the relevant parameters was also analyzed in an experimental analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7419294/07317572.pdf","startPage":"1757","endPage":"1774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Background Feature Extraction: An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Inspired by Slowly Varying Signal Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Kernel","Feature extraction","Estimation","Detectors","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hyperspectral imaging","signal detection","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection algorithm","signal analysis","hyperspectral anomaly detection","anomaly target","complex spectral mixture","robust background feature extraction","background spectral signal","eigenvalue decomposition problem","extracted signal","Mahalanobis distance metric","detection estimation","data processing procedure","signal extraction pattern","background-signal-based detector","synthetic data","real hyperspectral data","anomaly detector","receiver operating characteristic curve","ROC curve","area-under-ROC value","background-target separation","sensitivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","hyperspectral","signal analysis","slowly varying background estimation"]},{"kwd":["Anomaly detection","hyperspectral","signal analysis","slowly varying background estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Background Feature Extraction: An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Inspired by Slowly Varying Signal Analysis","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7317572/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823064","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB719905 and 2011CB707105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471274, 41431175 and 61401317"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Background Feature Extraction: An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Inspired by Slowly Varying Signal Analysis","sourcePdf":"tgrs-du-2488285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134537S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7419294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7419294","articleId":"7317572","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317574,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Quan","affiliation":["Laboratoire International Associ\u00e9, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7422867/7317574/quan-small.gif","p":["Quan Quan received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Beihang University\n (Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics), Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","He has been an Associate Professor at Beihang University since 2013.

It overcomes limitations of motion control system with nonconstrained SFC resulting in low dynamic properties. The novel concept utilizes machine voltage equation model to calculate the boundary values of control signals which provide permissible values of the future state variables.

Motivated by this, orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), which is very successful in mobile communications for its low complexity and high performance, has already been investigated for MIMO backscatter RFID. Also a recently proposed scheme called unitary query was shown to be able to considerably improve the reliability of MIMO backscatter RFID by exploiting query diversity. Therefore, incorporating the classical OSTBC (at the tag end) with the unitary query (at the query end) seems promising. However, in this paper, we first show that simple direct employment of OSTBC together with unitary query incurs a linear decoding problem and eventually leads to severe performance degradation. As a redesign of the unitary query idea and the classical OSTBC specifically for MIMO backscatter RFID, we present a BUTQ-mOSTBC design pair idea by proposing the block-level unitary query (BUTQ) at the query end and the corresponding modified OSTBC (mOSTBC) at the tag end. The proposed BUTQ-mOSTBC can resolve the linear decoding problem, keep the simplicity and high performance properties of the classical OSTBC, and achieve the query diversity for the MIMO backscatter RFID.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497240","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07317583.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Level Unitary Query: Enabling Orthogonal-Like Space-Time Code With Query Diversity for MIMO Backscatter RFID","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Block-Level Unitary Query: Enabling Orthogonal-Like Space-Time Code With Query Diversity for MIMO Backscatter RFID","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837546","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317583/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Level Unitary Query: Enabling Orthogonal-Like Space-Time Code With Query Diversity for MIMO Backscatter RFID","sourcePdf":"twc-he-2497240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131621S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317583","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7317584,"authors":[{"name":"Brian B.

Compared to droop control, which is only well defined in sinusoidal steady state, VOC is a time-domain controller that enables interconnected inverters to stabilize arbitrary initial conditions to a synchronized sinusoidal limit cycle. However, the nonlinear oscillators that are elemental to VOC cannot be designed with conventional linear-control design methods. We address this challenge by applying averaging- and perturbation-based nonlinear analysis methods to extract the sinusoidal steady-state and harmonic behavior of such oscillators. The averaged models reveal conclusive links between real- and reactive-power outputs and the terminal-voltage dynamics. Similarly, the perturbation methods aid in quantifying higher order harmonics. The resultant models are then leveraged to formulate a design procedure for VOC such that the inverter satisfies standard ac performance specifications related to voltage regulation, frequency regulation, dynamic response, and harmonic content. Experimental results for a single-phase 750 VA, 120 V laboratory prototype demonstrate the validity of the design approach. They also demonstrate that droop laws are, in fact, embedded within the equilibria of the nonlinear-oscillator dynamics. This establishes the backward compatibility of VOC in that, while acting on time-domain waveforms, it subsumes droop control in sinusoidal steady state.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2497217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7423826/07317584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2497217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423826","startPage":"6002","endPage":"6015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesizing Virtual Oscillators to Control Islanded Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthesizing Virtual Oscillators to Control Islanded Inverters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"15823189","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007000","fundingName":"Laboratory Directed Research and Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC36-08-GO28308"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation under the CAREER Award","grantNumber":"ECCS-CAR-1453921 and ECCS-1509277"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000141410639"},{"fundingName":"ETH Z\u00fcrich funds and the SNF Assistant Professor Energy","grantNumber":"160573"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesizing Virtual Oscillators to Control Islanded Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-johnson-2497217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7317584","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7317586,"authors":[{"name":"Saud Althunibat","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Al-Hussein Bin Talal University, Ma'an, Jordan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7317586/althu-2497349-small.gif","p":["\n\nSaud Althunibat received the B.Sc. degree in electrical \nengineering/communications from Mutah University, Mu'tah, Jordan, in 2004; the M.Sc. degree in electrical \nengineering/communications from the University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 2010; and the Ph.D. degree from the \nUniversity of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2014.","From 2011 to 2014, he has been a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher, working within the GREENET Project at the \nUniversity of Trento.

In an SSDF attack, a malicious user or many malicious users send false sensing results to the fusion center (FC) to mislead the global decision about spectrum occupancy. Thus, an SSDF attack degrades the achievable detection accuracy, throughput, and energy efficiency of CR networks (CRNs). In this paper, a novel attacker-identification algorithm is proposed that is able to skillfully detect attackers and reject their reported results. Moreover, we provide a novel attacker-punishment algorithm that aims at punishing attackers by lowering their individual energy efficiency, motivating them either to quit sending false results or leave the network. Both algorithms are based on a novel assessment strategy of the sensing performance of each user. The proposed strategy is called delivery-based assessment, which relies on the delivery of the transmitted data to evaluate the made global decision and the individual reports. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show promising performance of both algorithms compared with previous works, particularly when then the number of attackers is very large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16316600","htmlLink":"/document/7317586/","displayDocTitle":"Identification and Punishment Policies for Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification Attackers Using Delivery-Based Assessment","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Project GREENET","grantNumber":"PITN-GA-2010-264759"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and Punishment Policies for Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification Attackers Using Delivery-Based Assessment","sourcePdf":"tvt-althunibat-2497349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115618S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7317586","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317590,"authors":[{"name":"Toufiqul Islam","affiliation":["Huawei Canada Research Center, Ottawa, Canada","University of British Columbia, Vancouver"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7317590/islam-2497342-small.gif","p":["Toufiqul Islam (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2006, 2008, and 2014, respectively.

However, in practice, link selection may have to be performed based on outdated CSI, because of infrequent feedback of CSI and/or feedback delay. In this paper, we study the effect of outdated CSI on the error rate performance of adaptive link selection for a three node decode-and-forward (DF) relay network with fixed-rate transmission. In particular, we propose two protocols for link selection based on whether the reliability of the CSI estimates is known or not. For both protocols, we provide a unified error-rate analysis in terms of a decision threshold \u03b2, which can be adjusted to maintain buffer stability, and derive asymptotic approximations, which reveal the diversity and coding gains. Since packet transmission delay is unavoidable for opportunistic link selection, we analyze the average delay and throughput considering both finite and infinite buffer size. The average delay and throughput are functions of the decision threshold \u03b2, which can be optimized to minimize the error rate while satisfying average delay and/or throughput constraints. Numerical results manifest that even with outdated CSI, adaptive link selection provides a significant coding gain advantage over conventional DF relaying. Furthermore, we show that a diversity gain of two can be achieved for perfect CSI and the optimum error rate can be approached with small delay and/or high throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07317590.pdf","startPage":"1979","endPage":"1997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Outdated CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317590/","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Outdated CSI","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837542","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317590/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE WCNC 2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Outdated CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-islam-2497342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115213S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317590","onlineDate":"03 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7317720,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we study the deployment of D2D communications as an underlay to long-term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) networks based on novel architectures such as cloud radio access network (C-RAN). The challenge is that both energy efficiency (EE) and quality of service (QoS) are severely degraded by the strong intracell and intercell interference due to dense deployment and spectrum reuse. To tackle this problem, we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm through joint channel selection and power allocation design. The proposed algorithm has a hybrid structure that exploits the hybrid architecture of C-RAN: distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) and centralized baseband unit (BBU) pool. The distributed resource allocation problem is modeled as a noncooperative game, and each player optimizes its EE individually with the aid of distributed RRHs. We transform the nonconvex optimization problem into a convex one by applying constraint relaxation and nonlinear fractional programming. We propose a centralized interference mitigation algorithm to improve the QoS performance. The centralized algorithm consists of an interference cancellation technique and a transmission power constraint optimization technique, both of which are carried out in the centralized BBU pool. The achievable performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through simulations, and the implementation issues and complexity analysis are discussed in detail.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2497712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7467596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2497712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7467596/07317725.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cloud-RAN-Based LTE-A Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cloud-RAN-Based LTE-A Networks","volume":"3","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317725/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985608","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317725/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203100 and 71061005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"26730056 and 15K15976"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"13MS19, 14MS08 and 15MS04"},{"fundingName":"China Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Corporation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cloud-RAN-Based LTE-A Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-dong-2497712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190802S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7467596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"7467596","articleId":"7317725","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7317729,"authors":[{"name":"James L.

Since the early 20th century, icebreakers have employed the flexibility and easy control of direct current (dc) motors to provide for ship operations that split ice with back and forth motion of the ship. More recently, cruise ships have employed diesel-electric propulsion systems to take advantage of the flexibility of diesel, as opposed to steam engines, and because the electric plant can also be used for hotel loads. Research vessels, ferries, tankers, and special purpose vessels have also taken advantage of increased flexibility and fuel efficiency with electric propulsion. Today, the U.S. Navy is building an \u201call electric\u201d destroyer to be named \u201cZumwalt,\u201d which employs two induction motors for propulsion. There are several different classes of motors that might be considered for use in ship propulsion, ranging from dc (commutator) motors through conventional induction and synchronous motors to permanent magnet synchronous machines, doubly fed machines and superconducting alternating current (ac) and acyclic homopolar machines. This review paper describes features of some of the major classes of motor that might be used in ship propulsion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317729/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"103","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602371","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7317729/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Motors for Ship Propulsion","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motors for Ship Propulsion","sourcePdf":"jproc-kirtley-2487044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077842S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7329673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7329673","articleId":"7317729","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7317734,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Lun Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8118221/7317734/tsai-2490163-small.gif","p":["Jia-Lun Tsai received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013.","He is currently an Adjunct Assistant Professor with the Department of Information Management, NTUST.

However, most CLSS schemes have adopted an inefficient and probabilistic hash function, called MapToPoint, making them hard for the computer system designer to implement efficiently. This paper develops a new efficient CLSS scheme using bilinear pairings. The proposed CLSS scheme has the lowest computational cost of signature generation and signature verification, compared to all of the other CLSS schemes. The signature length of our CLSS scheme is only one group element, which means that it is impossible for any CLSS scheme to have a lower signature size than ours. In addition, the MapToPoint operation is not used in our CLSS scheme, so the proposed scheme can be implemented more easily. A formal security analysis is presented, showing that the proposed scheme is secure against both super type I and super type II adversaries. Hence, the proposed scheme is suitable for both limited storage and limited computing capacity devices in low-bandwidth communication environments.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2490163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8118221/07317734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2490163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118221","startPage":"2395","endPage":"2402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Efficient Certificateless Short Signature Scheme Using Bilinear Pairings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Efficient Certificateless Short Signature Scheme Using Bilinear Pairings","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390184","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7317734/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Efficient Certificateless Short Signature Scheme Using Bilinear Pairings","sourcePdf":"jsyst-tsai-2490163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08375S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8118221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8118221","articleId":"7317734","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317736,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmalya Samanta","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology at Shibpur, Howrah, India"],"bio":{"p":["Nirmalya Samanta received the M.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the West Bengal University of Technology, India, in 2009.

To address the problem, in this paper, we have deployed nanocrystalline silicon oxide impedance immunosensor array coupled with incremental fuzzy logic. These sensors have been reported earlier to be more sensitive and specific, compared with others. But toxin estimation becomes sufficiently imprecise especially when the concentration of the non-target toxin is significantly more than that of the target toxin. It is, therefore, expected that this problem will aggravate for real food samples. Thus, to make these sensors commercially viable, the sensor data have been processed by the incremental fuzzy approach. The flexibility in this approach has enabled estimation of three mycotoxins in corn samples procured from two different geographical locations of India. The detection limit achieved is as low as 0.1 fg/ml with 93% accuracy even in presence of large quantities of non-target toxins and with limited calibration data set. In comparison with the existing reports, this is the most sensitive and selective approach for mycotoxin estimation in real food samples with negligible effect of food matrix interference.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2496998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7389453/07317736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2496998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389453","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanocrystalline Silicon Oxide Impedance Immunosensors for Sub-Femtomolar Mycotoxin Estimation in Corn Samples by Incremental Fuzzy Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nanocrystalline Silicon Oxide Impedance Immunosensors for Sub-Femtomolar Mycotoxin Estimation in Corn Samples by Incremental Fuzzy Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15722357","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317736/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology (DST) Women Excellence Award, Government of India"},{"fundingName":"DST Science for Equity Empowerment and Development, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanocrystalline Silicon Oxide Impedance Immunosensors for Sub-Femtomolar Mycotoxin Estimation in Corn Samples by Incremental Fuzzy Approach","sourcePdf":"jsen-roychaudhuri-2496998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089974S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7389453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7389453","articleId":"7317736","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317737,"authors":[{"name":"Ci Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7317737/cchen-2497664-small.gif","p":["Ci Chen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Automation.","His research interests include robotic systems and intelligent control."]},"firstName":"Ci","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086620192"},{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7317737/zhliu-2497664-small.gif","p":["Zhi Liu received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1997, the M.S. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004, all in electrical engineering.","Currently, he is a Professor with the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Therefore, it is unreasonable to ignore actuator nonlinearity to realize the excellent performances of the vibration isolation. In this paper, the problem of unknown actuator backlash in the vibration isolation system is investigated. To handle the lines-segments backlash nonlinearity, an adaptive smooth backlash inverse is employed to compensate the deleterious effect. Moreover, a promising controller is proposed to ensure that the motion of the moving platform converges to desired values. Based on Lyapunov's second method, all of the involved signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be stable. Finally, comparative studies involving active vibration isolation with actuator backlash are constructed and carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07317737.pdf","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2497664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2497664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actuator Backlash Compensation and Accurate Parameter Estimation for Active Vibration Isolation System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Actuators","Joints","Parameter estimation","Fuzzy logic","Approximation methods","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","compensation","Lyapunov methods","parameter estimation","vibration isolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuator backlash compensation","parameter estimation","active vibration isolation system","lines-segments backlash nonlinearity","adaptive smooth backlash inverse","Lyapunov second method","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active vibration isolation system","actuator backlash","adaptive control","accurate parameter estimation"]},{"kwd":["Accurate parameter estimation","active vibration isolation system","actuator backlash","adaptive control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Actuator Backlash Compensation and Accurate Parameter Estimation for Active Vibration Isolation System","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7317737/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15785654","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China10.13039/501100001809","grantNumber":"61573108, 61273192 and 61333013"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of New Century Excellent Talent10.13039/501100004602","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0637"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S20120011437"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20124420130001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actuator Backlash Compensation and Accurate Parameter Estimation for Active Vibration Isolation System","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2497664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142328S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7317737","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317747,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/7355487/7317747/wu-small.gif","p":["Fei Wu received the BSc degree from Lanzhou University, Lanzhou,\n China, in 1996, the MSc degree from the University of Macau, Macau, China, in 1999, and the PhD degree from Zhejiang\n University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002, all in computer science.

Motivated by the recent advance in deep learning, we propose an approach called weakly semi-supervised deep learning for multi-label image annotation (WeSed). In WeSed, a novel weakly weighted pairwise ranking loss is effectively utilized to handle weakly labeled images, while a triplet similarity loss is employed to harness unlabeled images. WeSed enables us to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with images from social networks where images are either only weakly labeled with several labels or unlabeled. We also design an efficient algorithm to sample high-quality image triplets from large image datasets to fine-tune the CNN. WeSed is evaluated on benchmark datasets for multi-label annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show that the leverage of the weakly labeled images and unlabeled images leads to a significantly better performance.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2497270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2497270","startPage":"109","endPage":"122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/7355487/07317747.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weakly Semi-Supervised Deep Learning for Multi-Label Image Annotation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Weakly Semi-Supervised Deep Learning for Multi-Label Image Annotation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317747/","accessionNumber":"15663138","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317747/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB352300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1017828"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weakly Semi-Supervised Deep Learning for Multi-Label Image Annotation","sourcePdf":"tbdata-wu-2497270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187425S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"7355487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7355487","articleId":"7317747","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":7317748,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad U.

Microwave-Pumped Real-Time Thermoacoustic Breast Tumor Imaging System","abstract":"We report the design of a real-time thermoacoustic (TA) scanner dedicated to imaging deep breast tumors and investigate its imaging performance. The TA imaging system is composed of an ultrashort microwave pulse generator and a ring transducer array with 384 elements. By vertically scanning the transducer array that encircles the breast phantom, we achieve real-time, 3D thermoacoustic imaging (TAI) with an imaging speed of 16.7 frames per second. The stability of the microwave energy and its distribution in the cling-skin acoustic coupling cup are measured. The results indicate that there is a nearly uniform electromagnetic field in each XY-imaging plane. Three plastic tubes filled with salt water are imaged dynamically to evaluate the real-time performance of our system, followed by 3D imaging of an excised breast tumor embedded in a breast phantom. Finally, to demonstrate the potential for clinical applications, the excised breast of a ewe embedded with an ex vivo human breast tumor is imaged clearly with a contrast of about 1:2.8. The high imaging speed, large field of view, and 3D imaging performance of our dedicated TAI system provide the potential for clinical routine breast screening.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317776/","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7317776/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15823115","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"26552081","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultrashort Microwave-Pumped Real-Time Thermoacoustic Breast Tumor Imaging System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrashort Microwave-Pumped Real-Time Thermoacoustic Breast Tumor Imaging System","sourcePdf":"tmi-ye-2497901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067896S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7422860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7422860","articleId":"7317776","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7317781,"authors":[{"name":"Danny Finn","affiliation":["CONNECT, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Finn","id":"38469561300"},{"name":"Hamed Ahmadi","affiliation":["Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37410760600"},{"name":"Andrea F.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate the idea of multiuser multiple-input-multiple-input-based (MU-MIMO) cell reassignments. Dense small-cell deployments make it possible to pair user equipment units (UEs), which were originally assigned to different cells, enabling multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) and resulting in performance improvements to both UEs. We discuss how such pairings can be accomplished, and we assess the potential gains in the resulting spectral efficiency and MU-MIMO usage. These are assessed through both discussion of performance bounds and detailed system-level simulation in a realistic outdoor small-cell scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2497696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07317781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2497696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","startPage":"7764","endPage":"7768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Spectral Efficiency Through Multiuser MIMO Across Small Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Spectral Efficiency Through Multiuser MIMO Across Small Cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306031","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317781/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"10/CE/I1853 and 10/IN.1/I3007"},{"fundingName":"COST Action IC0902"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Spectral Efficiency Through Multiuser MIMO Across Small Cells","sourcePdf":"tvt-finn-2497696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053699S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7317781","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317784,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Makonin","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7593445/7317784/makon-2494592-small.gif","p":["Stephen Makonin received the Ph.D. degree in computing science from Simon Fraser University (SFU), in 2014.

Appliances can turn ON and OFF either by the actions of occupants or by automatic sensing and actuation (e.g., thermostat). It is also difficult to understand how much a load consumes at any given operational state. Occupants could buy sensors that would help, but this comes at a high financial cost. Power utility companies around the world are now replacing old electro-mechanical meters with digital meters (smart meters) that have enhanced communication capabilities. These smart meters are essentially free sensors that offer an opportunity to use computation to infer what loads are running and how much each load is consuming (i.e., load disaggregation). We present a new load disaggregation algorithm that uses a super-state hidden Markov model and a new Viterbi algorithm variant which preserves dependencies between loads and can disaggregate multi-state loads, all while performing computationally efficient exact inference. Our sparse Viterbi algorithm can efficiently compute sparse matrices with a large number of super-states. Additionally, our disaggregator can run in real-time on an inexpensive embedded processor using low sampling rates.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2494592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2494592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7593445/07317784.pdf","startPage":"2575","endPage":"2585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting HMM Sparsity to Perform Online Real-Time Nonintrusive Load Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting HMM Sparsity to Perform Online Real-Time Nonintrusive Load Monitoring","volume":"7","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317784/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16396369","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317784/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting HMM Sparsity to Perform Online Real-Time Nonintrusive Load Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tsg-makonin-2494592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107306S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7593445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"7593445","articleId":"7317784","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7317786,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Shad","affiliation":["University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7857818/7317786/shad-2492950-small.gif","p":["Mostafa Shad received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

On the residential side, domestic electric water heaters (DEWHs) form a significant end use class. The ability to accurately estimate and predict the state of individual end use devices allows aggregated control systems to better ensure end-use performance and comfort levels. This paper presents a methodology for estimating and predicting the state of individual DEWHs from models of their thermodynamics and water consumption that are derived under two scenarios: 1) when measurements of both power consumption and water temperature are available; and 2) when only measurements of power consumption are available. The proposed methodology was implemented as part of the PSA pilot project for the DEWH load class to simulate the behavior of the load in presence of the controller and evaluate the performance of the controller. Experimental results show that the model and water usage profile mimic the actual behavior of DEWHs, and can predict the future power consumption when the thermostatic control of a DEWH is interrupted as part of a load control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2492950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7857818/07317786.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2492950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and Estimation for Electric Water Heaters in Direct Load Control Programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317786/","displayDocTitle":"Identification and Estimation for Electric Water Heaters in Direct Load Control Programs","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16690049","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317786/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000159","fundingName":"Natural Resources Canada through the PowerShift Atlantic Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and Estimation for Electric Water Heaters in Direct Load Control Programs","sourcePdf":"tsg-shad-2492950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108004S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7857818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7857818","articleId":"7317786","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317793,"authors":[{"name":"Qingchen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7393924/7317793/zhang-small.gif","p":["Qingchen Zhang received the bachelor's and master's\n degrees from Southwest University, China.

However, current deep learning models work in the vector space, resulting in the failure to learn features for big data since a vector cannot model the highly non-linear distribution of big data, especially heterogeneous data. This paper proposes a deep computation model for feature learning on big data, which uses a tensor to model the complex correlations of heterogeneous data. To fully learn the underlying data distribution, the proposed model uses the tensor distance as the average sum-of-squares error term of the reconstruction error in the output layer. To train the parameters of the proposed model, the paper designs a high-order back-propagation algorithm (HBP) by extending the conventional back-propagation algorithm from the vector space to the high-order tensor space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we carried out the experiments on four representative datasets by comparison with stacking auto-encoders and multimodal deep learning models. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed model is efficient to perform feature learning when evaluated using the STL-10, CUAVE, SANE and INEX datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2497705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2497705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7393924/07317793.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Computation Model for Unsupervised Feature Learning on Big Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep Computation Model for Unsupervised Feature Learning on Big Data","volume":"9","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317793/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755177","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317793/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"National Sciences and Engineering Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000196","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Computation Model for Unsupervised Feature Learning on Big Data","sourcePdf":"tsc-yang-2497705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094474S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7393924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7393924","articleId":"7317793","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7317794,"authors":[{"name":"Lusheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7317794/wang-2497315-small.gif","p":["Lusheng Wang (S'08\u2013M'12) received the B.Sc. degree in communications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and networks from Telecom ParisTech (ENST), Paris, France, in 2010.","During 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Member with the Centre of Innovation in Telecommunications and Integration of service, INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France.

Recently, multilayer PFR schemes have been proposed, which are considered to be a promising evolution of this technique. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for multilayer PFR scheme design, which uses a triplet to completely describe a given PFR scheme. Then, closed-form expressions of the average spatial capacities of certain typical regions of a cell are derived. Based on a comprehensive analysis using this framework, a novel multilayer PFR scheme is designed, which divides each cell into inner, middle, and outer layers, with two homolographic sublayers for the middle layer. Reuse factors for the three layers are 1, 3/2, and 3, respectively, and an orthogonal division of the spectrum among different layers is guaranteed. Based on our numerical results, this novel scheme outperforms the traditional two-layer PFR scheme in max-min fairness without degrading the average spatial capacity. Compared with several representative multilayer PFR schemes, it achieves a better tradeoff between these two metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2497315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07317794.pdf","startPage":"7593","endPage":"7605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2497315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Framework for Multilayer Partial Frequency Reuse Scheme Design in Mobile Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317794/","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Framework for Multilayer Partial Frequency Reuse Scheme Design in Mobile Communication Systems","volume":"65","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16306029","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317794/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501160"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"2015HGCH0013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Framework for Multilayer Partial Frequency Reuse Scheme Design in Mobile Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2497315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143913S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7317794","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317796,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen M.

Advances in sensing technologies empower these systems further with real-time information about the surrounding environment. Leveraging these advancements in vehicle actuation and sensing, the authors present a shared control framework for obstacle avoidance and stability control using two safe driving envelopes. One of these envelopes is defined by the vehicle handling limits, whereas the other is defined by spatial limitations imposed by lane boundaries and obstacles. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme determines at each time step if the current driver command allows for a safe vehicle trajectory within these two envelopes, intervening only when such a trajectory does not exist. In this way, the controller shares control with the driver in a minimally invasive manner while avoiding obstacles and preventing loss of control. The optimal control problem underlying the controller is inherently nonconvex but is solved as a set of convex problems allowing for reliable real-time implementation. This approach is validated on an experimental vehicle working with human drivers to negotiate obstacles in a low friction environment.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2453404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7394960/07317796.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2453404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared Steering Control Using Safe Envelopes for Obstacle Avoidance and Vehicle Stability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317796/","displayDocTitle":"Shared Steering Control Using Safe Envelopes for Obstacle Avoidance and Vehicle Stability","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15754889","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317796/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared Steering Control Using Safe Envelopes for Obstacle Avoidance and Vehicle Stability","sourcePdf":"tits-erlien-2453404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094987S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7394960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"7394960","articleId":"7317796","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317797,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Yamamoto","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan","Analysis Center, Panasonic Corporation, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37085724226"},{"name":"Shuhei Matsuzawa","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Matsuzawa","id":"38667418100"},{"name":"Shinnosuke Ogawa","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinnosuke","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37085722817"},{"name":"Tomohiro Ota","affiliation":["Analysis Center, Panasonic Corporation, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Ota","id":"37286203200"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Hirata","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Hirata","id":"37085444341"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7317797","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluids","Electrostatics","Surface tension","Electromagnetics","Finite element analysis","Stress","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformation","electric fields","elongation","finite element analysis","Navier-Stokes equations","suspensions","viscosity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","particle method","extremely fine metal particle suspension","carrier fluid","electromagnetic field","electromagnetic fluid elongation","electromagnetic fluid sharpening","finite-element model","intensive deformation","interfacial fluid surface","3D coupled method","moving particle semi-implicit method","electrostatic field analysis","viscous terms","Navier-Stokes equations","high-viscosity electromagnetic fluid deformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic fluid","Coupled method","FEM","MPS","Implicit method"]},{"kwd":["Coupled method","electromagnetic fluid","finite-element model (FEM)","implicit method","moving particle semi-implicit (MPS)"]}],"abstract":"Electromagnetic fluid, which is usually a suspension of extremely fine particles of metal in carrier fluid, shows unique behaviors such as large deformation or a change of material properties in electromagnetic field.

A scalable signal processing framework is therefore highly desirable, which could be established based on the concept of virtual cell. In a virtual-cell based DAS, each user chooses a few neighboring base-station (BS) antennas to form its virtual cell, i.e, its own serving BS antenna set. In this paper, we focus on a downlink DAS with a large number of users and BS antennas uniformly distributed in a certain area, and aim to study the effect of the virtual cell size on the average user rate. Specifically, by assuming that maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is adopted in each user's virtual cell, the achievable ergodic rate of each user is derived as an explicit function of the large-scale fading coefficients from all the users to their virtual cells, and an upper-bound of the average user rate is established, based on which a rule of thumb is developed for determining the optimal virtual cell size to maximize the average user rate. The analysis is further extended to consider multiple users grouped together and jointly served by their virtual cells using zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). In contrast to the no-grouping case where a small virtual cell size is preferred, it is shown that by grouping users with overlapped virtual cells, the average user rate can be significantly improved by increasing the virtual cell size, though at the cost of a higher signal processing complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837518","htmlLink":"/document/7317799/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Rate Analysis for Virtual-Cell Based Large-Scale Distributed Antenna Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CityU Strategic Research","grantNumber":"7004232"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Rate Analysis for Virtual-Cell Based Large-Scale Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2497678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.550832S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317799","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317802,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Ge","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou, China","Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7892903/7317802/7317802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji Ge received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechatronics engineering from the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2012.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

During manufacturing, tiny foreign particles can be present in the ampoule injection. Therefore, strict inspection must be performed before ampoule injections can be sold for hospital use. In the quality control inspection process, most ampoule enterprises still rely on manual inspection which suffers from inherent inconsistency and unreliability. This paper reports an automated system for inspecting foreign particles within ampoule injections. A custom-designed hardware platform is applied for ampoule transportation, particle agitation, and image capturing and analysis. Constructed trajectories of moving objects within liquid are proposed for use to differentiate foreign particles from air bubbles and random noise. To accurately classify foreign particles, multiple features including particle area, mean gray value, geometric invariant moments, and wavelet packet energy spectrum are used in supervised learning to generate feature vectors. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in classifying foreign particles and reducing false positive rates. The automated inspection system inspects over 150 ampoule injections per minute (versus ~ 12 ampoule injections per minute by technologist) with higher accuracy and repeatability. In addition, the automated system is capable of diagnosing impurity types while existing inspection systems are not able to classify detected particles.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2490061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7892903/07317802.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1128","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2490061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System for Automated Detection of Ampoule Injection Impurities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"A System for Automated Detection of Ampoule Injection Impurities","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7317802/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807120","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System for Automated Detection of Ampoule Injection Impurities","sourcePdf":"tase-ge-2490061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098134S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7892903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7892903","articleId":"7317802","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7317803,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7317803/pyang-2497692-small.gif","p":["Ping Yang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

In order to retain all the benefits of conventional SM, we design the TPC matrix to be diagonal and introduce two design criteria for optimizing the elements of the TPC matrix. Specifically, we first investigate a TPC design based on maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n (max-d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n) between the SM signal points at the receiver side. A closed-form solution of the optimal max-d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n-based TPC matrix is derived. Then, another TPC design algorithm is proposed for directly minimizing the bit error ratio (BER) upper bound of SM, which is capable of jointly optimizing the overall Euclidean distance between all received signal points. In the minimum BER (min-BER)-based TPC algorithm, the theoretical gradient of the BER with respect to the diagonal TPC matrix is derived and a simplified iterative conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithm is invoked for TPC optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed max-d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n-based TPC algorithm is optimal in terms of the minimum distance.

In a cluster of N+1 receive nodes, one node is designated as the final receiver, and the N other nodes act as amplify-and-forward relays, which adapt their phases such that the relayed signals add up constructively at the designated receiver. This yields received SNR scaling linearly with N, while avoiding the linear increase in overhead incurred by a direct approach in which received signals are separately quantized and transmitted for centralized processing. By transforming the task of long-distance distributed receive beamforming into one of local distributed transmit beamforming, we can leverage a scalable one-bit feedback algorithm for phase synchronization. We show that time division between the long-distance and local links eliminates the need for explicit frequency synchronization. We provide an analytical framework, whose results closely match Monte Carlo simulations, to evaluate the impact of phase noise due to relaying delay on the performance of the one-bit feedback algorithm. Experimental results from our prototype implementation on software-defined radios demonstrate the expected gains in received signal strength despite significant oscillator drift, and are consistent with results from our analytical framework.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497687","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07317806.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2039","endPage":"2053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Architecture for Distributed Receive Beamforming: Analysis and Experimental Demonstration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317806","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7428982/7317806-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Architecture for Distributed Receive Beamforming: Analysis and Experimental Demonstration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317806/","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7317806/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837496","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1302114"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies","grantNumber":"W911NF-09-0001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Scalable Architecture for Distributed Receive Beamforming: Analysis and Experimental Demonstration","sourcePdf":"twc-quitin-2497687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151559S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317806","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317808,"authors":[{"name":"Georges Kaddoum","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure (ETS) Engineering School, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7317808/kaddo-2498040-small.gif","p":["Georges Kaddoum (M'11) received the Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de Techniques Avanc\u00e9es (ENSTA Bretagne), Brest, France; the M.S. degree in telecommunications and signal processing (circuits, systems, and signal processing) from Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Occidentale and Telecom Bretagne (ENSTB), Brest, in 2005; and the Ph.D. degree (with honors) in signal processing and telecommunications from the University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 2009.","Since 2010, he has been a Scientific Consultant in the field of space and wireless telecommunications for several companies (Intelcan Techno-Systems, MDA Corporation, and Radio-IP companies).

In particular, at the transmitter, the bit stream is divided into blocks in which each block is divided into two subblocks: mapped and modulated subblocks. Thereafter, the bits within the mapped subblock are used to select one of the predefined spreading codes, which is then used to spread the modulated bits of the second subblock. In this design, using the spreading code index as an information-bearing unit increases the overall spectral efficiency of this system. At the receiver side, the spreading code index is first estimated, thus resulting in a direct estimation of mapped subblock bits. Consequently, the corresponding spreading code to this estimated index is used to despread the modulated symbol of the modulated subblock. Subsequently, mathematical expressions for bit error rate (BER), symbol error rate (SER), throughput, energy efficiency, and the system complexity are derived to analyze the system performance. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed modulation scheme can achieve a higher data rate than the conventional DSSS system, with lower energy consumption and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2498040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07317808.pdf","startPage":"7000","endPage":"7009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2498040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Code Index Modulation Technique for High-Data-Rate Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Code Index Modulation Technique for High-Data-Rate Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317808/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16306037","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317808/","volume":"65","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"435243-2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Code Index Modulation Technique for High-Data-Rate Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kaddoum-2498040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08232S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7317808","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7317813,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Hoon Lee","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University (NCSU), Raleigh, NC, USA","Department of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7317813/jhlee-2497702-small.gif","p":["Jung Hoon Lee (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical communications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2006, 2008, and 2013, respectively.

In many practical systems, the uplink feedback channel is generally shared by multiple users. Thus, the feedback budget allocated to unselected users not only wastes the feedback resources, but harms the system throughput by decreasing the available feedback budget for the selected users. We optimize both the user selection and feedback bit allocation based on long-term average channel information of the users. We first analyze the effects of the quantization error on the average achievable rate of the VCN system. Next, we propose a user selection and feedback bit allocation protocol under each BS's sum feedback rate constraint as well as the sparsity constraint on all users' feedback sizes. We show that the joint optimization problem can be decoupled into several NP-hard subproblems, one for each BS. We describe the brute-force searching algorithm for the optimal solution, and propose an efficient algorithm with significantly reduced computational complexity by relaxing the sparsity constraint on the feedback sizes. As a result, only the selected users exploit the uplink feedback budget, and the system performance is improved.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07317813.pdf","startPage":"2069","endPage":"2079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint User Selection and Feedback Bit Allocation Based on Sparsity Constraint in MIMO Virtual Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317813","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7428982/7317813-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317813/","displayDocTitle":"Joint User Selection and Feedback Bit Allocation Based on Sparsity Constraint in MIMO Virtual Cellular Networks","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837497","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317813/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1016260, ECCS-1307949 and EARS-1444009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Joint User Selection and Feedback Bit Allocation Based on Sparsity Constraint in MIMO Virtual Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-dai-2497702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125172S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317813","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317815,"authors":[{"name":"P.

As the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution to this estimation problem is highly computationally tedious due to the requirement of multidimensional optimization, we propose an iterative scheme based on the oblique projection (OP), which separates the user signal in each iteration, resulting in decomposition of highly complex multidimensional search to many 1-D searches. We also derive a low-complexity approximation to the proposed technique, which makes use of precalculated projection matrices stored at the base station. The exact Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the joint estimation of CFOs and DSCs in MIMO-OFDMA uplink is also derived. Simulation studies indicate that the mean square error performance of the proposed techniques nearly achieves the CRB even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2497741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07317815.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2497741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","startPage":"7110","endPage":"7121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channel Estimation in High-Mobility MIMO-OFDMA Uplink Using Oblique Projection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channel Estimation in High-Mobility MIMO-OFDMA Uplink Using Oblique Projection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16316599","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7317815/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channel Estimation in High-Mobility MIMO-OFDMA Uplink Using Oblique Projection","sourcePdf":"tvt-muneer-2497741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094665S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7317815","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7317817,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7317817/zhihe-2497683-small.gif","p":["Zhiqiang He (S\u201901\u2013M\u201904) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees (with distinction) from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, both in signal and information processing, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.

All user equipments (UEs) are sources of their own content and form a multihop D2D chain, with the head of the chain being in charge of uploading all the generated content to the eNodeB. By pooling the cellular radio resources assigned to the D2D chain and by using high-quality short-range radio links, the proposed cooperative content uploading scheme guarantees lower upload delays than in the traditional cellular mode operation. To model the D2D chain formation in a cell and to best characterize self-interested users concerned about their own payoff, a constrained coalition formation game is defined, where each UE is a player whose cost is identified as the content upload time. The solution of the game determines the stable feasible partition for the UEs in the cell. We demonstrate through simulations that with this solution the content uploading time is reduced by 52% with respect to the traditional cellular mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constrained Coalition Formation Game for Multihop D2D Content Uploading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2497682","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07317822.pdf","startPage":"2012","endPage":"2024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2497682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Constrained Coalition Formation Game for Multihop D2D Content Uploading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7317822/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837512","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constrained Coalition Formation Game for Multihop D2D Content Uploading","sourcePdf":"twc-militano-2497682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123887S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7317822","onlineDate":"04 November 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7317828,"authors":[{"name":"Dakai Chen","affiliation":["code 561, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dakai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37066174200"},{"name":"Edward Wilcox","affiliation":["ASRC Space and Defense, c.o.

The device is available as an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory. We found that single-event functional interrupt (SEFI) is the dominant SEE type for each operational mode (standby, dynamic read, and dynamic write/read). SEFIs occurred even while the device is statically biased in standby mode. Worst case SEFIs resulted in errors that filled the entire memory space. Power cycle did not always clear the errors. Thus the corrupted cells had to be reprogrammed in some cases. The device is also vulnerable to bit upsets during dynamic write/read tests, although the frequency of the upsets are relatively low.

In fact, by utilizing the device-to-device technologies, which make use of the mobile device resources, vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and pedestrian-to-pedestrian (P2P) communications can be more effective and convenient. In this article, we present a concept of relay by smart device that aims at information dissemination by smart communication devices, which can contribute to efficient information sharing among vehicles and pedestrians. We propose a novel technique for effectively forming and disbanding the groups of vehicles and pedestrians for their communications. The proposed mechanism is based on three criteria, namely, the stability of the group, the activity of the group, and the qualification as a group leader. Procedures for group forming and disbanding are introduced. We develop a prototype as a smartphone application using Wi-Fi technology, referred to as the second generation of relay by smartphone, which is the smartphone type of relay by smart device. The results of the field experiment show that the proposed group-based information sharing technology has a good potential to be utilized in V2P, V2V, and P2P communications.","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2015.2481558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10209/7317850/07317856.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2015.2481558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317850","startPage":"54","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay by Smart Device: Innovative Communications for Efficient Information Sharing Among Vehicles and Pedestrians","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relay by Smart Device: Innovative Communications for Efficient Information Sharing Among Vehicles and Pedestrians","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660678","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7317856/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay by Smart Device: Innovative Communications for Efficient Information Sharing Among Vehicles and Pedestrians","sourcePdf":"10mvt04-nishiyama-2481558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048311S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"7317850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7317850","articleId":"7317856","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7317859,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Murat Uysal (murat.uysal@ozyegin.edu.tr) is currently a full professor at Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey.

The performance gain of a controller utilizing an opponent model learned via AL when compared to a controller using just UCT is shown both with win/loss ratios and True Skill rankings.

Phantom game is a kind of such games, which usually has a large game-tree complexity and has little research achievements until now. In Phantom games, rational human players commonly select actions according to their beliefs in the game, which can be represented as a concept of belie f-state. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first article to incorporate belief-states in the Monte-Carlo Tree Search, and the proposed algorithm is named BS-MCTS (Belief-state Monte-Carlo Tree Search). In BS-MCTS, a belief-state tree, in which each node is a belief-state, is constructed and the search procedure is in accordance with beliefs updated by heuristic search information. We also present two novel implementations in the belief learning, that are Opponent Guessing and Opponent Predicting, concerning the probability on the possible states and on future actions of the opponent respectively. To prove the effectiveness of our algorithm, BS-MCTS is applied to Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe and Phantom Go against other Monte-Carlo methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is outstanding and advanced. Moreover, based on BS-MCTS, our Phantom Go program had consecutively won three championships in Chinese National Tournaments.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302806/7317656/07317917.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2015.7317917","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2015.7317917","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317917","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Phantoms","Monte Carlo methods","Mathematical model","Bismuth","Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief-state Monte-Carlo tree search","phantom games","BS-MCTS","heuristic search information","belief learning","opponent guessing","opponent predicting","phantom tic-tac-toe","phantom Go"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317917/","displayDocTitle":"Belief-state Monte-Carlo tree search for Phantom games","accessionNumber":"15574564","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7317917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief-state Monte-Carlo tree search for Phantom games","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"CIG2015submission29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136438S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302806","isNumber":"7317656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7317656","articleId":"7317917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317918,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Yin","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085718433"},{"name":"Linbo Luo","affiliation":["School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Linbo","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085532831"},{"name":"Wentong Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wentong","lastName":"Cai","id":"38183351000"},{"name":"Yew-Soon Ong","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yew-Soon","lastName":"Ong","id":"37298277000"},{"name":"Jinghui Zhong","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jinghui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085530253"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8622-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8621-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"}],"articleNumber":"7317918","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Adaptation models","Artificial neural networks","Training","Feature extraction","Engines","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human computer interaction","neural nets","serious games (computing)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online game difficulty adaptation","digital game","data-driven approach","players ingame performance","dynamic game states","artificial neural networks","training game application","serious game"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317918","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2015.7317918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2015.7317918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317656","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302806/7317656/07317918.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven approach for online adaptation of game difficulty","abstract":"Dynamic adaptation of games with the objective of catering to the individual players' level of standard is an emerging and challenging research area of artificial intelligence in digital game.

One example would be the UCT algorithm, which applies the UCB bandit algorithm. Various research has been conducted on applying other bandit algorithms to MCTS. Simple regret bandit algorithms, which aim to identify the optimal arm after a number of trials, have been of great interest in various fields in recent years. However, the simple regret bandit algorithm has the tendency to spend more time on sampling suboptimal arms, which may be a problem in the context of game tree search. In this research, we will propose combined confidence bounds, which utilize the characteristics of the confidence bounds of the improved UCB and UCB \u221a\u00b7 algorithms to regulate exploration for simple regret minimization in MCTS.

However, it is relatively unclear what game properties enhance or degrade the performance of MCTS, while the largeness of search space including pruning efficiency mainly governs the performance of classical minimax search, assuming a decent evaluation function is given. Existing research has shown that the distribution of suboptimal moves and the non-uniformity of tree shape are more important than the largeness of state space in discussing the performance of MCTS. Our study showed that another property, bias in suboptimal moves, is also important, and we present an enhancement to better handle such situations. We focus on a game tree in which the game-theoretical value is even, while suboptimal moves for a player tend to contain more inferior moves than those for the opponent. We conducted experiments on a standard incremental tree model with various MCTS algorithms based on UCB1, KL-UCB, or Thompson sampling. The results showed that the bias in suboptimal moves degraded the performance of all algorithms and that our enhancement alleviated the effect caused by this property.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302806/7317656/07317924.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"50","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2015.7317924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2015.7317924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancements in Monte Carlo tree search algorithms for biased game trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements in Monte Carlo tree search algorithms for biased game trees","htmlLink":"/document/7317924/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15574554","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements in Monte Carlo tree search algorithms for biased game trees","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"CIG2015submission43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070689S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302806","isNumber":"7317656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302806","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7317656","articleId":"7317924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7317927,"authors":[{"name":"Peter I.

In such games, gathering of information (inference) is a key strategic aspect, to which information hiding (bluffing, among other techniques) is an important countermeasure. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful general-purpose technique for decision making in games. MCTS rose to prominence through successes in combinatorial board games such as Go, but more recently has demonstrated promise in card, board and video games of incomplete information. MCTS can construct robust plans in stochastic environments (making it strong in some games), but in its vanilla form is unable to infer or bluff (making it weak in games where this is a central feature). In this paper, we augment MCTS with mechanisms for performing inference and bluffing. Like all algorithms based on game tree search, MCTS implicitly constructs a model of the opponents' decision processes. We show that this model can be repurposed to perform an approximation of Bayesian inference. We also obtain bluffing behaviour by self-determinization (introducing \u201cimpossible\u201d worlds into the agent's pool of sampled states). We test our algorithms on The Resistance, a popular card game based around hidden roles.","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2015.7317927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317656","startPage":"114","endPage":"121","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302806/7317656/07317927.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2015.7317927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emergent bluffing and inference with Monte Carlo Tree Search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Decision trees","Resistance","Computational modeling","Monte Carlo methods","Artificial intelligence","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","computer games","decision making","inference mechanisms","Monte Carlo methods","stochastic games","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo tree search","card and board game","game state","information hiding","MCTS","general-purpose technique","decision making","combinatorial board game","video game","stochastic environment","game tree search","Bayesian inference","bluffing behaviour","card game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Emergent bluffing and inference with Monte Carlo Tree Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317927/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317927/","accessionNumber":"15574529","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emergent bluffing and inference with Monte Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"CIG2015submission51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098416S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302806","isNumber":"7317656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7317656","articleId":"7317927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317937,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik Frydenberg","affiliation":["IT-Universitetet i Kobenhavn, Kobenhavn, DK"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Frydenberg"},{"name":"Kasper R.

Recently, several modifications to the core MCTS algorithm have been proposed with the hope to increase its effectiveness on arcade-style video games. This paper investigates of how well these modifications perform in general video game playing using the general video game AI (GVG-AI) framework and introduces a new MCTS modification called UCT reverse penalty that penalizes the MCTS controller for exploring recently visited children. The results of our experiments show that a combination of two MCTS modifications can improve the performance of the vanilla MCTS controller, but the effectiveness of the modifications highly depends on the particular game being played.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302806/7317656/07317937.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2015.7317937","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2015.7317937","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317937","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Avatars","Artificial intelligence","Monte Carlo methods","Animals","Sprites (computer)","Missiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computer games","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo tree search","board games","MCTS algorithm","general video game playing","general video game AI","UCT reverse penalty","vanilla MCTS controller","GVG-AI framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317937/","displayDocTitle":"Investigating MCTS modifications in general video game playing","accessionNumber":"15574531","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7317937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating MCTS modifications in general video game playing","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"CIG2015submission65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060105S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302806","isNumber":"7317656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302806","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7317656","articleId":"7317937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7317970,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, UK"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zhijie Xu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, UK"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Xu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7317970","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"abstract":"Video-based crowd behaviour detection aims at tackling challenging problems such as automating and identifying changing crowd behaviours under complex real life situations. In this paper, real-time crowd anomaly detection algorithms have been investigated. Based on the spatio-temporal video volume concept, an innovative spatio-temporal texture model has been proposed in this research for its rich crowd pattern characteristics. Through extracting and integrating those crowd textures from surveillance recordings, a redundancy wavelet transformation-based feature space can be deployed for behavioural template matching. Experiment shows that the abnormality appearing in crowd scenes can be identified in a real-time fashion by the devised method. This new approach is envisaged to facilitate a wide spectrum of crowd analysis applications through automating current Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)-based surveillance systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Conference on Imaging for Crime Prevention and Detection (ICDP-15)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7244053/7244054/07317970.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"6th International Conference on Imaging for Crime Prevention and Detection (ICDP-15)","doi":"10.1049/ic.2015.0102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2015.0102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowd anomaly detection for automated video surveillance","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowd anomaly detection","automated video surveillance","video based crowd behaviour detection","crowd behaviours",", real-time crowd","spatio-temporal video volume concept","crowd pattern characteristics","surveillance recordings","wavelet transformation","feature space","behavioural template matching","current closed circuit television","CCTV","computer vision","video analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["crowd behaviour","video surveillance","spatio-temporal texture","optical flow","wavelet transformation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Crowd anomaly detection for automated video surveillance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382040","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowd anomaly detection for automated video surveillance","confLoc":"London","sourcePdf":"20150102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034581S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2015","isNumber":"7244054","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7244053","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7317970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7317974,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, India"],"bio":{"p":["Neeraj Kumar (neeraj.Kumar@thapar.edu) is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, India.

However, due to uncertain demands for the usage of resources of SGs, there may be a performance bottleneck at some points in SGs. An intelligent infrastructural support for PEVs is thus required so that the PEVs can perform energy trading from the SG control center. The energy can be generated from various conventional and nonconventional sources. Keeping focus on these points, we present an intelligent energy harvesting and traffic flow forecasting for PEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment. In the proposed game, vehicles are assumed as the players of the game such that learning components are assumed to be deployed on these vehicles having cooperation with intermediate relay nodes. The selection of the relay nodes is completed using a Naive Bayes classifier having input parameters as the current payoff of the players in the game. The payoff value (PV) is given to the players using the link quality and mobility pattern. The proposed scheme is evaluated using metrics such as the probability of data delivery, delay incurred, operational cost, and energy gap. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed coalition game in a V2G environment.","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2015.2481562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10209/7317850/07317974.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2015.2481562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Playing the Smart Grid Game: Performance Analysis of Intelligent Energy Harvesting and Traffic Flow Forecasting for Plug-In Electric Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7317974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7317974/","displayDocTitle":"Playing the Smart Grid Game: Performance Analysis of Intelligent Energy Harvesting and Traffic Flow Forecasting for Plug-In Electric Vehicles","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660683","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7317974/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Playing the Smart Grid Game: Performance Analysis of Intelligent Energy Harvesting and Traffic Flow Forecasting for Plug-In Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"10mvt04-kumar-2481562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055497S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"7317850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7317850","articleId":"7317974","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7318004,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasios Dimou","affiliation":["Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Dimou"},{"name":"Dimitra Matsiki","affiliation":["Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitra","lastName":"Matsiki"},{"name":"Apostolos Axenopoulos","affiliation":["Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Greece"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Axenopoulos"},{"name":"Petros Daras","affiliation":["Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Greece"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Daras"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-131-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7318004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user interfaces","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surveillance videos","user-centric approach","event-driven summarization","video summarization","low-level visual information","consecutive frames","detected events","representative frames","intuitive user interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video summary","key frames","event"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A user-centric approach for event-driven summarization of surveillance videos","abstract":"In this paper, a user-centric approach for video summarization is introduced.

The antagonism between expressivity and analysability has led to a number of different such programming models, which provide different degrees of freedom to the programmer. One example are Kahn process networks (KPNs), which, due to certain restrictions in communication, can guarantee determinacy (their results are independent of timing by construction). On the other hand, certain dataflow models, such as the CAL Actor Language, allow non-determinacy and thus higher expressivity, however at the price of static analysability and thus a potentially less efficient implementation. In many cases, however, non-determinacy is not required (or even not desired), and relying on KPN for the implementation seems advantageous. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for classifying dataflow actors (i.e. computational elements) as KPN compatible or potentially not. For KPN compatible dataflow actors, we propose an automatic KPN translation method based on this algorithm. In experiments, we show that more than 75% of all mature actors of a standard multimedia benchmark suite can be classified as KPN compatible and that their execution time can be reduced by up to 1.97x using our proposed translation technique. Finally, in a manual classification effort, we validate these results and list different classes of KPN incompatibility.","doi":"10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318265","startPage":"105","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313572/7318008/07318265.pdf","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318265","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318265/","displayDocTitle":"Executing dataflow actors as kahn processes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318265/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15586740","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Executing dataflow actors as kahn processes","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"04_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102901S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313572","isNumber":"7318008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313572","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7318008","articleId":"7318265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7318275,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Pan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085363754"},{"name":"Mimi Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Mimi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085362996"},{"name":"Chengmo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Chengmo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37597788000"},{"name":"Zili Shao","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Shao","id":"37085383035"},{"name":"Jingtong Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Jingtong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37309334200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8079-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7318275","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Memory management","Maximum likelihood estimation","Random access memory","Virtual machining","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","maximum likelihood estimation","random-access storage","storage management","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile main memory aware garbage collection","NVM","high-level language virtual machine","phase change memory","PCM","embedded systems","next generation main memory","write endurance","write operation","living objects remapping","LORE","dead object stamping","DOS","smart wiping with maximum likelihood estimation","SMILE"]}],"abstract":"Non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as Phase Change Memory (PCM) have been considered as promising candidates of next generation main memory for embedded systems due to their attractive features. These features include low power, high density, and better scalability. However, most existing NVMs suffer from two drawbacks, namely, limited write endurance and expensive write operation in terms of both time and energy. These problems are worsen when modern high-level languages employ virtual machine with garbage collector that generates a large amount of extra writes on non-volatile main memory. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes three techniques: Living Objects Remapping (LORE), Dead Object Stamping (DOS), and Smart Wiping with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (SMILE) to reduce the unnecessary writes when garbage collector handles objects. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques not only significantly reduce the writes during each garbage collection cycle but also greatly improve the performance of virtual machine.","doi":"10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318275","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7313572/7318008/07318275.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318008","startPage":"197","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonvolatile main memory aware garbage collection in high-level language virtual machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318275","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonvolatile main memory aware garbage collection in high-level language virtual machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318275/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15586739","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318275/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonvolatile main memory aware garbage collection in high-level language virtual machine","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"08_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132053S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7313572","isNumber":"7318008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7313572","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7318008","articleId":"7318275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318319,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Matrone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019 Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Matrone","id":"37601432700"},{"name":"Alessandro Stuart Savoia","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Roma Tre, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro Stuart","lastName":"Savoia","id":"37297973200"},{"name":"Giosu\u00e8 Caliano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Roma Tre, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Giosu\u00e8","lastName":"Caliano","id":"37283901400"},{"name":"Giovanni Magenes","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019 Informazione, Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Magenes","id":"37328000800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7318319","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Focusing","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Delays","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","microwave imaging","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing","delay multiply-sum beamforming algorithm","breast cancer","microwave imaging","algorithm processing","contrast resolution","DMAS-beamformed B-mode images","ultrasound signals","dynamic focusing","backscattered signal coherence","DMAS images"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Signal-To-Noise Ratio","Ultrasonography"]}],"abstract":"The Delay Multiply and Sum (DMAS) beamforming algorithm was originally conceived for microwave imaging of breast cancer. In a previous work, we demonstrated that, by properly modifying and improving the algorithm processing steps, DMAS can be successfully applied to ultrasound signals for B-mode image formation and that it outperforms standard Delay and Sum (DAS) beamforming in terms of contrast resolution. As previously pointed out, however, DMAS-beamformed B-mode images, in which fixed and dynamic focusing are applied respectively during transmit and receive operations, show an intensity drop away from the transmit focal depth compared to DAS images. This could be due to the fact that DMAS beamforming is based on a measure of backscattered signal coherence, which reaches its maximum only at the transmit focus, where signals are perfectly realigned. The preliminary results presented in this work show that, by employing Synthetic Aperture Focusing (SAF), which allows to achieve dynamic focusing both on transmission and reception, this intensity loss is compensated, as DAS and DMAS images have almost the same maximum amplitude level at all depths.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318319","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318319.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318319","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound Synthetic Aperture Focusing with the Delay Multiply and sum beamforming algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound Synthetic Aperture Focusing with the Delay Multiply and sum beamforming algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318319/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318319/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585228","pubMedId":"26736219","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound Synthetic Aperture Focusing with the Delay Multiply and sum beamforming algorithm","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"00341238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066065S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7318340,"authors":[{"name":"Axel Thielscher","affiliation":["Danish Research Center for Magnetic Resonance, Technical University of Denmark, Hvidovre, Denmark"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Thielscher","id":"37085548201"},{"name":"Andre Antunes","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Antunes","id":"37085652601"},{"name":"Guilherme B Saturnino","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics.

The proposed emotion recognition system is capable of differentiating four kinds of emotions, namely neutral, happiness, stress, and sadness, based on the heart rate variability (HRV). Ten male subjects were involved in the study. Both visual and auditory stimuli were used to stimulate the emotions. Four categories of HRV features, namely time-domain, frequency-domain, Poincare plot, and differential features, were exploited to characterize the physiological changes during the affective stimuli. The support vector machine (SVM) was employed as the classifier. The genetic algorithm (GA) was exploited as feature selector. Without feature selector, only 52.2% recognition rate was achieved. However, with the GA feature selector, an optimal recognition rate of 90% was achieved. Compared with other user-independent systems published in the literature, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 90% which is demonstrated to be the most effective for discriminating four kinds of emotions with user-independent design policy.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318418","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318418.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"541","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion state identification based on heart rate variability and genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Emotion state identification based on heart rate variability and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15584237","pubMedId":"26736318","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318418/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion state identification based on heart rate variability and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"01362116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.272898S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7318450,"authors":[{"name":"Chihiro Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Scienves, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Chihiro","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37085706428"},{"name":"Koichi Ito","affiliation":["Tohoku Daigaku, Sendai, Miyagi, JP"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37291559300"},{"name":"Kai Wu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology, P.R.C."],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085707079"},{"name":"Kazunori Sato","affiliation":["Institute of Development Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Sato","id":"37085717267"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Taki","affiliation":["Institute of Development Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Taki","id":"37943830400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Fukuda","affiliation":["Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37085706852"},{"name":"Takafumi Aoki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Scienves, Tohoku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Aoki","id":"37085712083"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7318450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Feature extraction","Aging","Support vector machines","Image databases","Biomedical imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["age estimation method","brain local features","T1 weighted images","statistical analysis","large scale brain magnetic resonance image databases","age related morphological changes","brain tissues","Japanese MR image database"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain","Female","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male"]}],"abstract":"Previous statistical analysis studies using large-scale brain magnetic resonance (MR) image databases have examined that brain tissues have age-related morphological changes. This fact indicates that one can estimate the age of a subject from his/her brain MR image by evaluating morphological changes with healthy aging. This paper proposes an age estimation method using local features extracted from T1-weighted MR images. The brain local features are defined by volumes of brain tissues parcellated into local regions defined by the automated anatomical labeling atlas. The proposed method selects optimal local regions to improve the performance of age estimation. We evaluate performance of the proposed method using 1,146 T1-weighted images from a Japanese MR image database.

Experimental results showed that this approach is a suitable strategy outperforming the state-of-the-art representation from 79.9% to 86% in terms of area under the ROC curve.","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318482.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318482","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for mammography mass lesion classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for mammography mass lesion classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318482/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318482/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584859","pubMedId":"26736382","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural networks for mammography mass lesion classification","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"02010081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064534S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318502,"authors":[{"name":"G.N.

electrode-electrolyte interface. The proposed current excited triple-time-voltage oversampling (TTVO) method deduces the component values by solving triple simultaneous electric equation (TSEE) at different time nodes during a current excitation, which are the voltage functions of time. The proposed triple simultaneous electric equations (TSEEs) allows random selections of the time nodes, hence numerous solutions can be obtained during a single current excitation. Following that, the oversampling approach is engaged by averaging all solutions of multiple TSEEs acquired after a single current excitation, which increases the practical measurement accuracy through the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, a print circuit board (PCB) that consists a switched current exciter and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is designed for signal acquisition. This presents a great cost reduction when compared against other instrument-based measurement data reported [1]. Through testing, the measured values of this work is proven to be in superb agreements on the true component values of the electrode-electrolyte interface model.

Use of intramuscular EMG has shown promise for both wrist and hand control in able-bodied subjects, but to date has not been evaluated in amputee subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate two regression-based simultaneous control methods using intramuscular EMG in transradial amputees and compare their performance to able-bodied subjects. Two transradial amputees and sixteen able-bodied subjects used fine wire EMG recorded from six forearm muscles to control three wrist/hand DOFs: wrist rotation, wrist flexion/extension, and hand open/close. Both linear regression and probability-weighted regression systems were evaluated in a virtual Fitts' Law test. Though both amputee subjects initially produced worse performance metrics than the able-bodied subjects, the amputee subject who completed multiple experimental blocks of the Fitts' law task demonstrated substantial learning. This subject's performance was within the range of able-bodied subjects by the end of the experiment. Both amputee subjects also showed improved performance when using probability-weighted regression for targets requiring use of only one DOF, and mirrored statistically significant differences observed with able-bodied subjects. These results indicate that amputee subjects may require more learning to achieve similar performance metrics as able-bodied subjects. These results also demonstrate that comparative findings between linear and probability-weighted regression with able-bodied subjects reflect performance differences when used by the amputee population.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318562","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1123","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318562.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time simultaneous myoelectric control by transradial amputees using linear and probability-weighted regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time simultaneous myoelectric control by transradial amputees using linear and probability-weighted regression","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318562/","accessionNumber":"15585177","pubMedId":"26736462","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318562/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time simultaneous myoelectric control by transradial amputees using linear and probability-weighted regression","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"02831600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067687S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318564,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","affiliation":["NCSU/UNC Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716160000"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["NCSU/UNC Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"38237723700"},{"name":"He Huang","affiliation":["NCSU/UNC Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401091200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7318564","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"Combination of intrinsic control and volitional control that recognizes the user's locomotion mode (LM) has been applied to powered prosthetic legs, which enables lower limb amputees to adapt to varying terrains seamlessly. However, errors in volitional control may disrupt the user's walking balance. This study aimed to determine whether the critical errors in volitional control could be detected before they disturbed the user's walking. The positive answer might lead to more robust volitional control for powered prosthetic legs. To achieve this goal, volitional control and intrinsic control were connected hierarchically to operate a powered transfemoral prosthesis. Critical errors for recognizing the user's LM were introduced artificially when transfemoral amputees walked with the powered prosthesis. Intrinsic measurements from the prosthesis were explored first in order to select effective data sources for error detection. Then a phase-dependent outlier detector was designed and offline evaluated. The results demonstrated that the designed detector can detect the tested critical errors with a high sensitivity and a low false alarm ratio before the errors disrupted the amputees' balance. Additional engineering efforts were still necessary to test the detector on more error types and design a control strategy that can make volitional control of powered lower limb prosthesis robust and safe to use.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318564.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1131","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of critical errors of locomotion mode recognition for volitional control of powered transfemoral prostheses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Legged locomotion","Knee","Measurement uncertainty","Detectors","Joints","Angular velocity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","medical control systems","prosthetics","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrinsic control","user locomotion mode","prosthetic legs","robust volitional control","transfemoral prosthesis","error detection","phase-dependent outlier detector","low-false alarm ratio","lower limb prosthesis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Amputees","Artificial Limbs","Humans","Locomotion","Prosthesis Design","Volition","Walking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection of critical errors of locomotion mode recognition for volitional control of powered transfemoral prostheses","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585933","pubMedId":"26736464","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of critical errors of locomotion mode recognition for volitional control of powered transfemoral prostheses","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"02851760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063648S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318663,"authors":[{"name":"Annika Mikola","affiliation":["North Estonian Medical Centre, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Annika","lastName":"Mikola","id":"37085735096"},{"name":"Indrek R\u00e4tsep","affiliation":["North Estonian Medical Centre, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Indrek","lastName":"R\u00e4tsep","id":"37426523300"},{"name":"Mika S\u00e4rkel\u00e4","affiliation":["GE Healthcare Finland, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"S\u00e4rkel\u00e4","id":"37426491800"},{"name":"Tarmo Lipping","affiliation":["Information Technology Dept. in Pori, Tampere University of Technology, Pori, Finland"],"firstName":"Tarmo","lastName":"Lipping","id":"37426636300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7318663","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Frequency-domain analysis","Brain injuries","Prognostics and health management","Indexes","Electrodes","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","injuries","medical signal processing","patient treatment","probability","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature probability","receiver operating curve","postoperative intensive care unit","power spectrum","long-term qEEG features","traumatic brain injury patient treatment","outcome prediction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Humans","Intensive Care Units","Monitoring, Physiologic","Prognosis"]}],"abstract":"Treatment of patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly involves sedation and mechanical ventilation during prolonged stay in the intensive care unit.

In this paper, we propose a novel technique, named compressed sensing based synthetic transmit aperture (CS-STA), to speed up the acquisition of ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound transducer transmits plane wave with random apodizations for several times and receives the corresponding echoes. The full dataset of STA is then recovered from the recorded echoes using a CS reconstruction algorithm. Finally, a standard STA beamforming is performed on the dataset to form a B-mode image. When the number of CS-STA firings is smaller than the number of STA firings, higher frame rate is achieved. In addition, CS-STA maintains the high resolution of STA because of the CS recovered full dataset of STA, and improves the contrast due to plane wave firings. Computer simulations and phantom experiments are carried out to investigate the feasibility and performance of the proposed CS-STA method. The CS-STA method is proven to be capable of obtaining simultaneously high frame rate, high solution and high contrast ultrasound imaging.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318668","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318668.pdf","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for high frame rate, high resolution and high contrast ultrasound imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318668/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for high frame rate, high resolution and high contrast ultrasound imaging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585043","pubMedId":"26736568","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318668/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for high frame rate, high resolution and high contrast ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"03900786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082469S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318700,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel algorithm for precise detection of the onset of a motor movement through identification of event-related-desynchronization (ERD) patterns. Using an adaptive matched filter technique implemented based on an optimized continues Wavelet transform by selecting an appropriate basis, we can detect single-trial ERDs.

This paper focuses on the UWB radar imaging approach and in particular on the processing algorithms of the backscattered signals. Assuming the use of the multistatic version of the MIST (Microwave Imaging Space-Time) beamforming algorithm, developed by Hagness et al. for the early detection of breast cancer, the paper proposes and compares two artifact removal algorithms. Artifacts removal is an essential step of any UWB radar imaging system and currently considered artifact removal algorithms have been shown not to be effective in the specific scenario of brain imaging. First of all, the paper proposes modifications of a known artifact removal algorithm. These modifications are shown to be effective to achieve good localization accuracy and lower false positives. However, the main contribution is the proposal of an artifact removal algorithm based on statistical methods, which allows to achieve even better performance but with much lower computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318761/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15584998","pubMedId":"26736661","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318761/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Artifact removal algorithms for stroke detection using a multistatic MIST beamforming algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artifact removal algorithms for stroke detection using a multistatic MIST beamforming algorithm","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"04841611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039498S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318776,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085391763"},{"name":"Jianjiang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37399558100"},{"name":"Miao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085731845"},{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085378827"},{"name":"James K.

Alignment of coronary arteries in CTA images acquired at different times (with a 3-7 years interval) is required to visualize and analyze the geometric and structural changes quantitatively. Previous work in image registration primarily focused on large anatomical structures and leads to suboptimal results when applying to registration of coronary arteries. In this paper, we develop a novel method to directly align the straightened coronary arteries in the cylindrical coordinate system guided by the extracted centerlines. By using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), image intensity information from CTA and geometric information of extracted coronary arteries are combined to align coronary arteries. After registration, the pathological features in two straightened coronary arteries can be directly visualized side by side by synchronizing the corresponding cross-sectional slices and circumferential rotation angles.

One approach taken in recent neuroprosthetic design is to use a multi-input, multi-output device that reads data from the CA3 in the hippocampus and electrically stimulates the CA1 in an attempt to mimic the appropriate firing pattern that would occur naturally between the two areas. However, further study needs to be conducted in order to optimize electrode placement, pulse magnitude, and shape for creating the appropriate firing pattern. This paper describes the creation and implementation of an anatomically correct 3D model of the hippocampus to simulate the electric field patterns and axonal activation from electrical stimulation due to an implanted electrode array. The activating function was applied to the voltage results to determine the firing patterns in possible axon locations within the CA1.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Hippocampus","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical electrodes","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D admittance-level computational model","rat hippocampus","prosthetic design","hippocampal prosthetic devices","brain injury","diseases","electrode placement","pulse magnitude","firing pattern","electric field patterns","axonal activation","electrical stimulation","implanted electrode array","axon locations","CA1"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Electric Stimulation","Electrodes, Implanted","Hippocampus","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Models, Neurological","Prosthesis Design","Rats"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318851","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318851.pdf","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3-D admittance-level computational model of a rat hippocampus for improving prosthetic design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3-D admittance-level computational model of a rat hippocampus for improving prosthetic design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318851/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318851/","accessionNumber":"15585882","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","pubMedId":"26736751","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3-D admittance-level computational model of a rat hippocampus for improving prosthetic design","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"05792502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056713S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7318864,"authors":[{"name":"Shilin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

Furthermore, the quality and quantity of the tissue in the wound bed also offer important prognostic information. Unfortunately, accurate measurements of wound surface area changes are out of reach in the busy wound practice setting. Currently, clinicians estimate wound size by estimating wound width and length using a scalpel after wound treatment, which is highly inaccurate. To address this problem, we propose an integrated system to automatically segment wound regions and analyze wound conditions in wound images. Different from previous segmentation techniques which rely on handcrafted features or unsupervised approaches, our proposed deep learning method jointly learns task-relevant visual features and performs wound segmentation. Moreover, learned features are applied to further analysis of wounds in two ways: infection detection and healing progress prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automate long-term predictions of general wound healing progress. Our method is computationally efficient and takes less than 5 seconds per wound image (480 by 640 pixels) on a typical laptop computer. Our evaluations on a large-scale wound database demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318881/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15585016","pubMedId":"26736781","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318881/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A unified framework for automatic wound segmentation and analysis with deep convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified framework for automatic wound segmentation and analysis with deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"06090299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057613S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7318901,"authors":[{"name":"Qi She","affiliation":["Q.

In this work, we developed and tested realistic artificial Spiking Neural Networks inspired to this brain region. We tested in computational simulations of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex protocol three different models: a network equipped with a single plasticity site, at the cortical level; a network equipped with a distributed plasticity, at both cortical and nuclear levels; a network with a pathological plasticity mechanism at the cortical level. We analyzed the learning performance of the three different models, highlighting the behavioral differences among them. We proved that the model with a distributed plasticity produces a faster and more accurate cerebellar response, especially during a second session of acquisition, compared with the single plasticity model. Furthermore, the pathological model shows an impaired learning capability in Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex acquisition, as found in neurophysiological studies. The effect of the different plasticity conditions, which change fast and slow dynamics, memory consolidation and, in general, learning capabilities of the cerebellar network, explains differences in the behavioral outcome.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318903","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318903.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318903","startPage":"2514","endPage":"2517","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Healthy and pathological cerebellar Spiking Neural Networks in Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318903/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584272","pubMedId":"26736803","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Healthy and pathological cerebellar Spiking Neural Networks in Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"06321832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066696S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7318906,"authors":[{"name":"Brian S.

Given that neural regions are generally sparsely connected, input selection is a critical step in model estimation but oftentimes computationally and theoretically challenging. In this paper, we detail an efficient methodology for estimating a sparse, nonlinear dynamical multiple-input, single-output model (MISO) applicable to large-scale (n > 50) single-unit recorded activity. The main contribution of this paper is the complete implementation of a principled group-lasso and local coordinate descent (LCD) algorithm into a generalized Volterra model (GVM) framework to achieve efficient sparse model estimation. Input selection is achieved with group-lasso by simultaneously selecting groups of parameters that are associated with each input. LCD yields efficient computation as the amount of inputs and parameters increase. We investigate and validate the performance of this estimation procedure with the application to a 64 input simulated model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational

Experiments carried on the datasets PH2 (single source) and EDRA (multi source) show that late fusion performs better, leading to classification scores of Sensitivity = 98% and Specificity = 90% (PH\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) and Sensitivity = 83% and Specificity = 76% (EDRA).","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318937","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Melanoma detection algorithm based on feature fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Melanoma detection algorithm based on feature fusion","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584635","pubMedId":"26736837","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melanoma detection algorithm based on feature fusion","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"06662176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064106S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318942,"authors":[{"name":"Dongjin Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Dongjin","lastName":"Seo","id":"37085456909"},{"name":"Hao-Yen Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Hao-Yen","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085442217"},{"name":"Jose M.

emotion monitoring using relative wavelet energy feature and Back Propagation Neural Network","abstract":"In EEG-based emotion recognition, feature extraction is as important as the classification algorithm. A good choice of features results in higher recognition rate. However, there is no standard method for feature extraction in EEG-based emotion recognition, especially for real time monitoring, where speed of computation is crucial. In this work, we assess the use of relative wavelet energy as features and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as classifier for emotion recognition.

Early diagnosis of this kind of cancer can significantly increase the chances of long-term survival. Since diagnosis of breast cancer is a complex problem, neural network (NN) approaches have been used as a promising solution. Considering the low speed of the back-propagation (BP) algorithm to train a feed-forward NN, we consider a number of improved NN trainings for the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset: BP with momentum, BP with adaptive learning rate, BP with adaptive learning rate and momentum, Polak-Ribikre conjugate gradient algorithm (CGA), Fletcher-Reeves CGA, Powell-Beale CGA, scaled CGA, resilient BP (RBP), one-step secant and quasi-Newton methods. An NN ensemble, which is a learning paradigm to combine a number of NN outputs, is used to improve the accuracy of the classification task. Results demonstrate that NN ensemble-based classification methods have better performance than NN-based algorithms. The highest overall average accuracy is 97.68% obtained by NN ensemble trained by RBP for 50%-50% training-test evaluation method.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318982","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318982.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2839","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of breast cancer diagnosis based on neural network ensemble via improved training algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of breast cancer diagnosis based on neural network ensemble via improved training algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15584465","pubMedId":"26736882","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7318982/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of breast cancer diagnosis based on neural network ensemble via improved training algorithms","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"07112203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078216S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7318984,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Hennrich","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Hennrich","id":"37085631747"},{"name":"Christian Herff","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Herff","id":"38499200000"},{"name":"Dominic Heger","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Heger","id":"38495589200"},{"name":"Tanja Schultz","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Schultz","id":"37284937900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7318984","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1097},"abstract":"Functional Near infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a relatively young modality for measuring brain activity which has recently shown promising results for building Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Due to its infancy, there are still no standard approaches for meaningful features and classifiers for single trial analysis of fNIRS. Most studies are limited to established classifiers from EEG-based BCIs and very simple features. The feasibility of more complex and powerful classification approaches like Deep Neural Networks has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated for fNIRS based BCI. These networks have recently become increasingly popular, as they outperformed conventional machine learning methods for a variety of tasks, due in part to advances in training methods for neural networks. In this paper, we show how Deep Neural Networks can be used to classify brain activation patterns measured by fNIRS and compare them with previously used methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Biological neural networks","Feature extraction","Standards","Yttrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","feature extraction","infrared spectroscopy","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets","neurophysiology","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","fNIRS based BCI","functional near infrared spectroscopy","brain activity measurement","young modality","brain-computer interfaces","single trial analysis features","single trial analysis classifiers","EEG-based BCIs","deep neural networks","conventional machine learning methods","brain activation pattern classification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Machine Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)","Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318984","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07318984.pdf","startPage":"2844","endPage":"2847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating deep learning for fNIRS based BCI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7318984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigating deep learning for fNIRS based BCI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7318984/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7318984/","accessionNumber":"15584469","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","pubMedId":"26736884","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating deep learning for fNIRS based BCI","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"07132545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057041S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7318984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7318985,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085696807"},{"name":"James W.

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometrics utilizes the small intra-personal differences and large inter-personal differences between individuals' brainwave patterns. In the past, such methods have used features derived from manually-designed procedures for this purpose. Another possibility is to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically extract an individual's best and most unique neural features and conduct classification, using EEG data derived from both Resting State with Open Eyes (REO) and Resting State with Closed Eyes (REC). Results indicate that this CNN-based joint-optimized EEG-based Biometric System yields a high degree of accuracy of identification (88%) for 10-class classification. Furthermore, rich inter-personal difference can be found using a very low frequency band (0-2Hz).

However the challenge with large-scale screening is the inability to exhaustively detect fine blood vessels crucial to disease diagnosis. In this work we present a computational imaging framework using deep and ensemble learning based hybrid architecture for reliable detection of blood vessels in fundus color images. A deep neural network (DNN) is used for unsupervised learning of vesselness dictionaries using sparse trained denoising auto-encoders (DAE), followed by supervised learning of the DNN response using a random forest for detecting vessels in color fundus images. In experimental evaluation with the DRIVE database, we achieve the objective of vessel detection with max. avg. accuracy of 0.9327 and area under ROC curve of 0.9195.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319030","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319030.pdf","startPage":"3029","endPage":"3032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural network and random forest hybrid architecture for learning to detect retinal vessels in fundus images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319030/","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural network and random forest hybrid architecture for learning to detect retinal vessels in fundus images","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319030/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585896","pubMedId":"26736930","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural network and random forest hybrid architecture for learning to detect retinal vessels in fundus images","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"07591612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058595S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7319071,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While state of the art class E amplifiers widely being used to supply implanted systems show a strong degradation of efficiency when powering distance, coil orientation or the implant current consumption deviate from the nominal design, the presented concept is able to detect these deviations on-line and to reconfigure the amplifier automatically. The concept is facilitated by a new approach of sensing the load impedance without interruption of the power supply to the implant, while the main components of the class E amplifier are programmable by software. Therefore, the device is able to perform dynamic impedance matching. Besides presenting the operational principle and the design equations, we show an adaptive prototype reader system which achieves a drain efficiency of up to 92% for a wide range of reflected coil impedances from 1 to 40 \u03a9. The integrated communication concept allows downlink data rates of up to 500 kBit/s, while the load modulation based uplink from implant to reader was verified of providing up to 1.35 MBit/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7319071/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585251","pubMedId":"26736971","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A programmable and self-adjusting class E amplifier for efficient wireless powering of biomedical implants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable and self-adjusting class E amplifier for efficient wireless powering of biomedical implants","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"08001031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064797S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7319078,"authors":[{"name":"Wisam Al-Faqheri","affiliation":["Centre for Innovation in Medical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wisam","lastName":"Al-Faqheri","id":"38275745000"},{"name":"Fatimah Ibrahim","affiliation":["Centre for Innovation in Medical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Fatimah","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37297100400"},{"name":"Tzer Hwai Gilbert Thio","affiliation":["Centre for Innovation in Medical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, MY"],"firstName":"Tzer Hwai","lastName":"Gilbert Thio","id":"37088466275"},{"name":"Karunan Joseph","affiliation":["Centre for Innovation in Medical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Karunan","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37085609635"},{"name":"Mas S.

Conventional techniques are considered inappropriate for high-level amputees due to the lack of physiologically appropriate muscles. This study investigates how accurate phantom movements (PMs) can be classified from physiologically inappropriate muscles. The study involves a case study of a 42-year-old transhumeral amputee. Suitable PMs and best electrode configuration were identified using the sequential forward selection method and brute-force technique. Using linear discriminant analysis, the best PMs (elbow extension/flexion, wrist supination/pronation) and rest were classified with error ranging from 3% to 0.18% when using 3 to 8 EMG channels respectively. A completion rate of 93 % was obtained during a targeted achievement control test in a virtual reality environment.

This work stands in the challenging scenario where soft materials are combined with bio-inspired design in order to develop soft grippers with improved grasping and holding capabilities. We are going to show a low-cost, under-actuated and adaptable soft gripper, highlighting the design and the manufacturing process. In particular, a critical analysis is made among three versions of the gripper with same design and actuation mechanism, but based on different materials. A novel actuation principle has been implemented in both cases, in order to reduce the encumbrance of the entire system and improve its aesthetics. Grasping and holding capabilities have been tested for each device, with target objects varying in shape, size and material. Results highlight synergy between the geometry and the intrinsic properties of the soft material, showing the way to novel design principles for soft grippers.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319176","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319176.pdf","startPage":"3619","endPage":"3622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and development of a bio-inspired, under-actuated soft gripper","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319176/","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of a bio-inspired, under-actuated soft gripper","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584705","pubMedId":"26737076","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319176/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of a bio-inspired, under-actuated soft gripper","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"09062298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046591S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7319322,"authors":[{"name":"Kumaradevan Punithakumar","affiliation":["Department of Radiology & Diagnostic Imaging, AB, Canada, and also with Servier Virtual Cardiac Centre, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Kumaradevan","lastName":"Punithakumar","id":"37398995400"},{"name":"Michelle Noga","affiliation":["Department of Radiology & Diagnostic Imaging, AB, Canada, and also with Servier Virtual Cardiac Centre, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Noga","id":"37696739000"},{"name":"Pierre Boulanger","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, AB, Canada","Department of Radiology & Diagnostic Imaging, AB, Canada, and also with Servier Virtual Cardiac Centre, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Boulanger","id":"37269565700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7319322","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"This study proposes a parallel nonrigid registration algorithm to obtain point correspondence between a sequence of images. Several recent studies have shown that computation of point correspondence is an excellent way to delineate organs from a sequence of images, for example, delineation of cardiac right ventricle (RV) from a series of magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, nonrigid registration algorithms involve optimization of similarity functions, and are therefore, computationally expensive. We propose Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing to accelerate the algorithm. The proposed approach consists of two parallelization components: 1) parallel Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) version of the non-rigid registration algorithm; and 2) application of an image concatenation approach to further parallelize the algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated over a data set of 16 subjects and took an average of 4.36 seconds to segment a sequence of 19 MR images, a significant performance improvement over serial image registration approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319322.pdf","startPage":"4206","endPage":"4209","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU accelerated moving mesh correspondence algorithm with applications to RV segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Image registration","Image segmentation","Parallel processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiology","graphics processing units","image registration","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serial image registration","image concatenation approach","parallel compute unified device architecture","GPU computing","graphics processing unit","MRI image sequence","magnetic resonance imaging","cardiac right ventricle delineation","delineate organ","parallel nonrigid registration algorithm","right ventricle segmentation","moving mesh correspondence algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU computing","image registration","cardiac functional analysis","segmentation","moving mesh","magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Heart Ventricles","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A GPU accelerated moving mesh correspondence algorithm with applications to RV segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319322/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585394","pubMedId":"26737222","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU accelerated moving mesh correspondence algorithm with applications to RV segmentation","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"11051352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050324S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7319337,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085444019"},{"name":"Xiangdong Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085734702"},{"name":"Jay Griffin","affiliation":["Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Griffin","id":"37085722575"},{"name":"Jonathan M Levine","affiliation":["Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan M","lastName":"Levine","id":"37085736291"},{"name":"Jim Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Ji","id":"37286273900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7319337","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a common injury due to diseases or accidents. Noninvasive imaging methods play a critical role in diagnosing SCI and monitoring the response to therapy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), by the virtue of providing excellent soft tissue contrast, is the most promising imaging method for this application. However, spinal cord has a very small cross-section, which needs high-resolution images for better visualization and diagnosis. Acquiring high-resolution spinal cord MRI images requires long acquisition time due to the physical and physiological constraints. Moreover, long acquisition time makes MRI more susceptible to motion artifacts. In this paper, we studied the application of compressive sensing (CS) and parallel imaging to achieve high-resolution imaging from sparsely sampled and reduced k-space data acquired by parallel receive arrays. In particular, the studies are limited to the effects of 2D Cartesian sampling with different subsampling schemes and reduction factors. The results show that compressive sensing parallel MRI has the potential to provide high-resolution images of the spinal cord in 1/3 of the acquisition time required by the conventional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319337.pdf","startPage":"4266","endPage":"4269","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution MRI of spinal cords by compressive sensing parallel imaging","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","injuries","medical image processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing parallel imaging","spinal cord injury diagnosis","soft tissue contrast","high-resolution spinal cord MRI images","motion artifact","k-space data","parallel receive array","2D Cartesian sampling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Data Compression","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Motion","Spinal Cord"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution MRI of spinal cords by compressive sensing parallel imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585658","pubMedId":"26737237","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution MRI of spinal cords by compressive sensing parallel imaging","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"11212946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086416S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7319363,"authors":[{"name":"Bastin Joseph","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Bastin","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37085344877"},{"name":"Jose Joseph","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37085581017"},{"name":"Siva Rama Krishna Vanjari","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Siva Rama Krishna","lastName":"Vanjari","id":"37085535868"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7319363","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Array signal processing","Delays","Ultrasonic imaging","Table lookup","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","biomedical transducers","capacitive transducers","field programmable gate arrays","function generators","mathematics computing","power consumption","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conventional square root based algorithm","UMC technology","ASIC","application specific integrated circuit platform","Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA kit","arbitrary waveform generator","Matlab","power consumption","CMUT array symmetry","beamforming logic","low-power area efficient digital beamformer targeting low-frequency 1D linear capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array","low-power area efficient FPGA-based beamforming technique","size 90 nm","voltage 1.62 V","power 1.2895 mW"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Equipment Design","Transducers","Ultrasonography"]}],"abstract":"A low power area efficient digital beamformer targeting low frequency (2MHz) 1-D linear Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) array is developed.

In these people, the detrusor of bladder contracts at low volume and this causes incontinence. The goal of bladder control is to increase the bladder capacity by electrical stimulation of relative nerves such as pelvic nerves, sacral nerve roots or pudendal nerves. For this purpose, the bladder pressure has to be monitored continuously. In this paper, we propose a method for real-time estimating the bladder pressure using artificial neural network. The method is based upon measurements of electroneurogram (ENG) signal of pudendal nerve. This approach yields synthetic bladder pressure estimates during bladder contraction. The experiments were conducted on three rats. The results show that neural predictor can provide accurate estimation and prediction of bladder pressure with good generalization ability.

Experimental validation is done by comparing the results of gyroscope signal with footswitches. For healthy subjects, the mean difference between events detected by gyroscope and footswitches is 14 ms and 10.5 ms for initial contact (IC) whereas for toe off (TO) it is -5 ms and -25 ms for ramp up and down respectively. For transfemoral amputee, the error is slightly higher either due to the placement of footswitches underneath the foot or the lack of proper knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion/dorsiflexion during ramp up and down. Finally, repeatability tests showed promising results.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319464","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319464.pdf","startPage":"4785","endPage":"4788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time gait event detection for transfemoral amputees during ramp ascending and descending","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319464/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time gait event detection for transfemoral amputees during ramp ascending and descending","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585243","pubMedId":"26737364","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319464/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time gait event detection for transfemoral amputees during ramp ascending and descending","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"12492325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084743S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7319509,"authors":[{"name":"Siying Wang","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Siying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085704239"},{"name":"Antje Pohl","affiliation":["Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Aachen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Antje","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37078237100"},{"name":"Timo Jaeschke","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Systems, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Jaeschke","id":"38234270200"},{"name":"Michael Czaplik","affiliation":["Michael Czaplik is with Department of Anaesthesiology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Czaplik","id":"37601430900"},{"name":"Marcus K\u00f6ny","affiliation":["Philips Chair of Medical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"K\u00f6ny","id":"37541433000"},{"name":"Steffen Leonhardt","affiliation":["Philips Chair of Medical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Leonhardt","id":"38504548300"},{"name":"Nils Pohl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37303029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9271-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9270-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"7319509","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1884},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar measurements","Radar detection","Monitoring","Doppler radar","Heart rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","electrocardiography","FM radar","millimetre wave radar","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel ultra-wideband FMCW radar system","contactless monitoring","heart rate","ECG","physiological displacement","skin surface","intermediate frequency","phase evaluation","frequency 80 GHz","bandwidth 10 GHz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Carbon Dioxide","Equipment Design","Heart Rate","Humans","Monitoring, Physiologic","Radar","Respiration","Vital Signs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319509","abstract":"In this paper an ultra-wideband 80 GHz FMCW-radar system for contactless monitoring of respiration and heart rate is investigated and compared to a standard monitoring system with ECG and CO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n measurements as reference.

The fulcrum effect stemming from these incisions limits the safely reachable intraocular workspace and may result in scleral stress and collision with the intraocular lens. This paper proposes a concentric tube robot for panretinal interventions without risking scleral or lens damage. The robot is designed based on biometric measurements of the human eye, the required workspace, and the ease of incorporation in the clinical workflow. Our system is suited to 23G vitreoretinal surgery, which does not require post-operative suturing, by comprising sub-millimetre concentric tubes.

The UWB can accomplish higher data rate than the other frequency band for the implant communication. However, due to its high frequencies, the UWB signals suffer from quite large attenuation in the implant communication link, which makes it difficult to achieve reliable communications. For achieving reliable communication, it is well known that a spatial diversity technique is efficient without any frequency extension. In our previous works, we developed a transmit polarization diversity antenna for the UWB implant communication. However, optimal UWB modulation scheme for transmit diversity were rarely discussed. In this paper, in order to investigate the optimal UWB modulation schemes for implant communication with transmit diversity, we compare the communication performances of UWB-impulse radio (UWB-IR) and multiband-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM). For this purpose, we first analyze the propagation characteristics in the implant UWB channel, which ranges from 3.4 GHz to 4.8 GHz, using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) numerical analysis technique. Then, we evaluate and discuss the communication performances of both modulation schemes for the transmit polarization diversity from the viewpoint of the BER and the required transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319629","startPage":"5469","endPage":"5472","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319629.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison between UWB-IR and MB-OFDM with transmit diversity in implant communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319629/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison between UWB-IR and MB-OFDM with transmit diversity in implant communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319629/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15584627","pubMedId":"26737529","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison between UWB-IR and MB-OFDM with transmit diversity in implant communications","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"14191508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057328S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7319688,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Butlin","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Butlin","id":"38228594600"},{"name":"Peta J Hathway","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Peta J","lastName":"Hathway"},{"name":"Zahra Kouchaki","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Kouchaki","id":"38489350500"},{"name":"Karen Peebles","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Peebles","id":"37085646627"},{"name":"Alberto P.

Accurate blood pressure estimation requires reliable quantification of the relationship between blood pressure and PWV. Regression to population normal values or, when using limb artery PWV, changing hydrostatic blood pressure within the limb provides a calibration index. Population lookup tables require accurate anthropometric correlates, assuming no individual variation. Only devices that measure PWV in the limb can use limb position changes. This study proposes a method for developing a calibration curve independent of lookup tables and useful for large artery PWV measurement, such as carotid-femoral PWV (PWV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cf</sub>\n).

Therefore, any appropriate analysis method for dealing with BSs should exhibit adjustable time-frequency (TF) resolution. The wavelet transform (WT) provides a TF representation of signals, which has good frequency resolution at low frequencies and good time resolution at high frequencies, resulting in an optimized TF resolution. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is used in various medical signal processing applications such as denoising and feature extraction, is a fast and discretized algorithm for classical WT. However, the DWT has some very important drawbacks such as aliasing, lack of directionality, and shift-variance. To overcome these drawbacks, a new improved discrete transform named as Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) can be used. Nowadays, with the improvements in embedded system technology, portable real-time medical devices are frequently used for rapid diagnosis in patients. In this study, in order to implement DTCWT algorithm in FPGAs, which can be used as real-time feature extraction or denoising operator for biomedical signals, a novel hardware architecture is proposed. In proposed architecture, DTCWT is implemented with only one adder and one multiplier. Additionally, considering the multi-channel outputs of biomedical data acquisition systems, this architecture is capable of running N channels in parallel.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319765","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319765.pdf","startPage":"6026","endPage":"6029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field programmable gate arrays implementation of Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319765/","displayDocTitle":"Field programmable gate arrays implementation of Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585975","pubMedId":"26737665","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319765/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field programmable gate arrays implementation of Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"15570914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072697S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7319838,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Concerning breast cancer image diagnosis with ultrasound, some results found in the literature show better performance of morphological features in breast cancer lesion differentiation and that a reduced set of features shows a better performance than a large set of features. In this study we evaluated the performance of neural network classifiers, with different training stop criteria: mean square error, early stop and regularization. The last two criteria were developed to improve neural network generalization. Different sets of morphological features were used as neural network inputs. Training sets comprised of 22, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 features were employed. To select reduced sets of features, a scalar selection technique with correlation was used. The best results obtained for accuracy and area under the ROC curve were 96.98% and 0.98, respectively. The performance obtained with all 22 features is slightly better than the one obtained with a reduced set of features.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319838","startPage":"6321","endPage":"6325","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319838.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast tumor classification in ultrasound images using neural networks with improved generalization methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Training","Breast cancer","Ultrasonic imaging","Lesions","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","feature extraction","image classification","mammography","medical image processing","neural nets","sensitivity analysis","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast tumor classification","ultrasound images","improved generalization methods","scintimammography","breast cancer image diagnosis","breast cancer lesion differentiation","neural network classifiers","mean square error","improve neural network generalization","morphological feature extraction","scalar selection technique","area under the ROC curve"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Area Under Curve","Breast Neoplasms","Female","Humans","Mammography","Neural Networks (Computer)","ROC Curve","Retrospective Studies","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Breast tumor classification in ultrasound images using neural networks with improved generalization methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15585493","pubMedId":"26737738","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast tumor classification in ultrasound images using neural networks with improved generalization methods","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"16310164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071583S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7319857,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

The ubiquity of digital cameras presents the possibility for many new, low-cost applications of vital sign monitoring. In this paper we present a review of the work on remote photoplethysmographic (PPG) imaging using digital cameras. This review specifically focuses on the state-of-the-art in PPG imaging where: 1) measures beyond pulse rate are evaluated, 2) non-ideal conditions (e.g., the presence of motion artifacts) are explored, and 3) use cases in relevant environments are demonstrated. We discuss gaps within the literature and future challenges for the research community. To aid in the continuing advancement of PPG imaging research, we are making available a website with the references collected for this review as well as information on available code and datasets of interest. It is our hope that this website will become a valuable resource for the PPG imaging community.

To be robust against optical path variation, an automatic emitting light compensation method is adopted. To remove the ambient light interference, we propose an alternating sampling and charge redistribution technique, in which no additional power is consumed, and only three differential switches and one capacitor are required.

However, EEG signal is mixed with other biological signals including Ocular and Muscular artefacts making it difficult to extract the diagnostic features. Therefore, the contaminated EEG channels are often discarded by the medical practitioners resulting less accurate diagnosis. In this paper we propose a real-time low-complexity and reliable system design methodology to remove these artefacts and noise in an automated fashion to aid online diagnosis under the pervasive personalized healthcare set-up without the need of any reference electrode. The simulation and hardware performance of the proposed methodology are measured and compared in terms of correlation and regression statistics lying above 80% and 67% which are much improved over the state-of-the art methodologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302811/7318236/07319951.pdf","startPage":"6784","endPage":"6787","publicationTitle":"2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7319951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online and automated reliable system design to remove blink and muscle artefact in EEG","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Hardware","Wavelet transforms","Muscles","Feature extraction","Medical services","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electroencephalography","health care","medical signal processing","real-time systems","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","real-time low-complexity methodology","reliable system design","EEG","muscular artefacts","blink artefacts","pervasive personalized healthcare set-up","regression statistics","correlation statistics","online diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","FastICA","Blink and Muscular Artefacts","Pervasive Healthcare"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Blinking","Electroencephalography","Humans","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7319951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Online and automated reliable system design to remove blink and muscle artefact in EEG","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7319951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15584113","pubMedId":"26737851","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online and automated reliable system design to remove blink and muscle artefact in EEG","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"17452906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094888S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302811","isNumber":"7318236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302811","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7318236","articleId":"7319951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"}]
