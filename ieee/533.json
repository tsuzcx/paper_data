The optimizing computation using conventional linear and nonlinear methods has a disadvantage, the dispersed variable approximation, which makes it can't correspond to the reality of reactive power optimization. Cataclysmic genetic algorithm (CGA) is a method of global optimization, which is suitable for mixed nonlinear planning problems with dispersed variables. Fuzzy-control method has an inherent merit for dealing with planning problems with soft constraints. To solve reactive power optimization problems with multi-objective functions, combining cataclysmic genetic algorithm with fuzzy control theory(HCGA) is a new effective method. Through the computation of a power system examples, comparing with the traditional genetic algorithm, this new algorithm is proved to have stable convergence, accurate and logical optimization results, moreover, a faster computation process. This new algorithm is competent of solving multi-objective mixed nonlinear planning problems.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.211","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1618","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331298/5331299/05331326.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Cataclysmic Genetic Algorithm Used to Reactive Power Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Reactive power","Power system planning","Optimization methods","Constraint optimization","Reactive power control","Fuzzy control","Mathematical model","Genetic engineering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid cataclysmic genetic algorithm","reactive power optimization","nonlinear mixed planning problem","global optimization","dispersed variables","fuzzy control method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cataclysmic generic algorithm","Fuzzy control","Reactive power optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Cataclysmic Genetic Algorithm Used to Reactive Power Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5331326/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975737","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Cataclysmic Genetic Algorithm Used to Reactive Power Optimization","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3769b615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104535S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331298","isNumber":"5331299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331298","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5331299","articleId":"5331326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5331328,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Tan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Tan","id":"37671855500"},{"name":"Lan Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37676614400"},{"name":"Hong Qi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Qi","id":"37273174200"},{"name":"Yandong Zhai","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Yandong","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37674924000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5209-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3769-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5331328","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text mining","Clustering algorithms","Web pages","Data mining","Search engines","Particle separators","Educational institutions","Computer science","Electronic mail","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","Internet","pattern clustering","search engines","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese text clustering system","text mining","Chinese word automatic segmentation","text preprocessing","K-means clustering algorithm","Chinese Web pages clustering","search engines","reverse maximum matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["text mining","Chinese text clustering","Chinese word segmentation","reverse maximum matching","K-means algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Clustering technology is the core technology of text mining.

Determining and estimating the physical location of tagged objects in an interrogating area is known as localization. In this paper, we study properties of passive UHF RFID systems such as the relationship between distance and RSSI (received signal strength indictor), performance variations among the same type of passive tags, and readabilities of tags. We propose a received signal strength based localization algorithm using passive UHF RFID system. The localization uses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate the physical position of the target tag. To improve the accuracy of the passive tag attached object location, the properties and characteristics are applied to the localization algorithm. According to the analysis of experimentation, our proposed approach shows over 34% improvement compared with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm with the use of single reader and a single antenna, and 13 reference tags.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.198","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331298/5331299/05331332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331299","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization Systems Using Passive UHF RFID","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5331332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization Systems Using Passive UHF RFID","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331332/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975739","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5331332/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization Systems Using Passive UHF RFID","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3769b727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041376S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331298","isNumber":"5331299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331298","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5331299","articleId":"5331332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5331336,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Jin Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Jin","lastName":"Seo","id":"37679198800"},{"name":"Seung-Ho Ok","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Ho","lastName":"Ok","id":"37671405000"},{"name":"Jin-Ho Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hoseo University, Chungcheongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37403230400"},{"name":"Sungho Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Kang","id":"37276366900"},{"name":"Byungin Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byungin","lastName":"Moon","id":"37647194300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5209-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3769-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5331336","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1065},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Search engines","Automotive engineering","Software algorithms","Shift registers","Satellite navigation systems","Computer science","Transportation","Telematics","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["search engines","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture","A-star algorithm","shortest path search engine","automotive vehicles","mobile navigation systems","shift register"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shortest-path search algorithm","A-star algorithm","shift register","priority queue","sorting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5331336","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.371","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","abstract":"There are several shortest-path search algorithms such as A-star, D-star and Dijkstra.

Therefore, energy efficient algorithms and protocols have been one of the most challenging issues for WSNs. Many researchers have focused on developing energy efficient cluster based protocols for WSNs, but there has not been much research on event driven WSNs and, their focus is on continuous networks. In this paper, we propose a modified algorithm of low energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol which is a well known energy efficient clustering algorithm for WSNs. Our modified protocol called ldquoenergy efficient clustering algorithm for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EECED)rdquo is aimed at prolonging the lifetime of a sensor network by balancing energy usage of the nodes. EECED makes the nodes with more residual energy have more chances to be selected as cluster head. Also, we use elector nodes which take the responsibility of collecting energy information of the nearest sensor nodes and selecting the cluster head. We compared the performance of our EECED algorithm with the LEACH protocol using simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EECED)","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.220","endPage":"1763","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331298/5331299/05331363.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","startPage":"1758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5331363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Clustering algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","Intelligent sensors","Intelligent networks","Intelligent structures","Monitoring","Surveillance","Intelligent transportation systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient clustering algorithm","wireless sensor networks","continuous networks","low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering algorithm","energy consumption","event-driven wireless sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EECED)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5331363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10975752","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks (EECED)","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3769b758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053271S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331298","isNumber":"5331299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331298","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5331299","articleId":"5331363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5331396,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

First, the sequence of the post-processing de-blocking filter is modified, and the filter algorithm is optimized. Second, the frames are extended at the upper and left frame boundaries for 8 pixels in depth in order to avoid the irregularity and simplify the control unit. At last a macro block-based together with block-based double pipelining design technology is adopted to improve efficiency of data flow control scheme and parallel calculation, and to improve the real time performance. 8-bit wide dual-port reading and writing at the same time memories are used to optimize the data storage structure, which effectively reducing hardware expenditure.

To this aim, tight current (or bit) distributions are needed so as to allocate all programmed levels in the allowed window. As opposed to the above requirement, technology driven spreads tend to increase when the memory cell shrinks to nanoscale sizes, and even atomic scale fluctuations can play an important role. In this scenario, the present work provides a new physically based approach that allows describing the statistical spread for the bit distributions of PCM arrays through a viable and flexible SPICE-like model.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2009.5331486","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307512/5331301/05331486.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2009.5331486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of bit distributions in Phase Change Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of bit distributions in Phase Change Memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976166","htmlLink":"/document/5331486/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of bit distributions in Phase Change Memories","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131002S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307512","isNumber":"5331301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307512","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5331301","articleId":"5331486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5331507,"authors":[{"name":"Vita Pi-Ho Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Vita Pi-Ho","lastName":"Hu","id":"37391915700"},{"name":"Ming-Long Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Long","lastName":"Fan","id":"37392424800"},{"name":"Pin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Su","id":"37286925700"},{"name":"Ching-Te Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Te","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37268438500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"}],"articleNumber":"5331507","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Performance analysis","Photonic band gap","Threshold voltage","Stability analysis","MOSFET circuits","CMOS technology","Tellurium","Design engineering","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","silicon-on-insulator","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual work function design","ultrathin-body SOI 6T SRAM cells","subthreshold region operation","single mid-gap design","dual quarter band-gap WF devices","read static noise margin","write static noise margin","stand-by leakage","high-performance applications","stability requirement"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyzes and compares the stability, margin, and performance of ultra-thin-body (UTB) SOI 6T SRAM cells operating in subthreshold region with single mid-gap and dual work function (WF) design.

Reliability tests under sunlight illumination show an ageing effect of the transistors. It is shown that the degradation of the transfer gate structure is linked to a modulation of the conduction path. Modification of the channel position influences the interaction between carriers in the channel and oxide traps next to the interface. The evolution of the 1/f noise performances of the transfer gate transistor is studied. The distinctiveness of the noise variation with different stress conditions is thoroughly discussed and the mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena are explained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307512/5331301/05331577.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"398","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2009.5331577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2009.5331577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5331577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise as a characterization tool for reliability under illumination of transfer gate transistor for image sensors applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Image sensors","Stress","Photodiodes","Testing","Degradation","Aging","Filters","Current measurement","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","ageing","CMOS integrated circuits","image sensors","integrated circuit reliability","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","transfer gate transistor","CMOS transistors","reliability tests","sunlight illumination","ageing effect","transfer gate structure","channel traps","oxide traps","1/f noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noise as a characterization tool for reliability under illumination of transfer gate transistor for image sensors applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5331577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976222","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise as a characterization tool for reliability under illumination of transfer gate transistor for image sensors applications","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057909S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307512","isNumber":"5331301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307512","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5331301","articleId":"5331577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5331581,"authors":[{"name":"Jingbang Qiu","affiliation":["Graduate School of IPS, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Jingbang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37591429100"},{"name":"Tianci Huang","affiliation":["Graduate School of IPS, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tianci","lastName":"Huang","id":"37672260900"},{"name":"Takeshi Ikenaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of IPS, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ikenaga","id":"37281527900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5209-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3769-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5331581","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-Based Dual-Pixel Processing Pipelined Hardware Accelerator for Feature Point Detection Part in SIFT","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331298/5331299/05331581.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1674","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331299","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.38","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Computer vision","Proposals","Robustness","Detection algorithms","Stability","Clocks","Frequency","Costs","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","interpolation","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based dual-pixel processing","pipelined hardware accelerator","feature point detection algorithms","three-stage-interpolation pipelined architecture","dual-port DDR2 memory access","maximum clock frequency","VGA images","memory operations","real-time SIFT system structure","frequency 145.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SIFT","FPGA","Dual-Pixel Processing","Pipeline","Feature Point Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5331581","abstract":"SIFT is regarded as one of the most robust feature point detection algorithms in CV field.

By introducing dual-pixel processing and the 3-stage-interpolation pipelined architecture with use of dual-port DDR2 memory access, we achieve to further improve process speed, meanwhile keeping high accuracy. By experiment, our system proves to reach max clock frequency of 145.0 MHz, processing up to 40 VGA images including memory operations.

It's some fascinating, large-scale processing of data that makes your head spin and appreciate the years of distributed computing fine-tuning applied to today's large problems. The evolution of cloud computing can handle such massive data as per on demand service. Nowadays the computational world is opting for pay-for-use models and Hype and discussion aside, there remains no concrete definition of cloud computing.

At first, each individual consists of two parts, the first part is the leader's variable values using real-encoding, whereas the second one is the sequence number of basic variables of the follower's programming, which are some integers. Then, a new fitness function is given, in which the optimality conditions of linear programming are incorporated into penalty term to guarantee the optimality of the follower's problem is satisfied. At last, based on the characteristic of individuals, new crossover and mutation operators are designed. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable.","doi":"10.1109/NCM.2009.312","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331298/5331299/05331790.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"573","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed-Encoding Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Bilevel Programming Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed-Encoding Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Bilevel Programming Problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10975959","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5331790/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed-Encoding Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Bilevel Programming Problems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3769a569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095339S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331298","isNumber":"5331299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331298","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5331299","articleId":"5331790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5331833,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Chin-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Wei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37673291400"},{"name":"Fu-Bin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Bin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37671788700"},{"name":"Hsing-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsing-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539854700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5209-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3769-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5331833","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"This paper studies the performance of adaptive vertical handoff schemes for overlayed WCDMA and wireless LAN (WLAN) heterogeneous networks.

The temperature dependences of electron mobilities are analyzed using an analytical equation of the percolation conduction model, which reveals that distributed potential barriers exist above mobility edges in IGZO with average heights 30-100 meV and distribution widths 5-20 meV, which depend on atomic structure and deposition condition of IGZO films. High-quality a-IGZO films have the lowest potential barriers among the IGZO films examined, in spite that a-IGZO has a more disordered amorphous structure than c-IGZO have. It is explained by the partly disordered structure of c-IGZO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5331948/","volume":"5","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5331948/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10968206","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Structures Above Mobility Edges in Crystalline and Amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O: Percolation Conduction Examined by Analytical Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Structures Above Mobility Edges in Crystalline and Amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O: Percolation Conduction Examined by Analytical Model","sourcePdf":"jdt-tkamiya-2022064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120167S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"5331937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"5331937","articleId":"5331948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5332033,"authors":[{"name":"Toshio Kamiya","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan","Materials and Structures Laboratory, Frontier Research Center, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9425/5331937/5332033/5332033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toshio Kamiya received the Ph.D. degree in materials science in from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1996.","He started his research carrier as an assistant professor of Department of Inorganic Materials at Tokyo Tech. in 1991, working on ferroelectric inorganic materials, while working toward the Ph.D. degree.

So far, many prototype displays have been demonstrated in these four years since the first report of AOS TFT. The most prominent feature of AOS TFTs is that they operate with good performances even if they are fabricated at low temperatures without a defect passivation treatment. The TFT mobilities exceed 10 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/(Vmiddots), which are more than ten times larger than those of conventional amorphous semiconductor devices. In addition, they operate at low voltages, e.g., < 5 V owing to their small subthreshold voltage swings. These features indicate that electron transport in oxide semiconductors are insensitive to random structures and these oxides do not form high-density defects that affect electron transport and TFT operation. In this paper, we discuss the origins of the prominent features of AOS devices from the viewpoint of materials science of AOS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332033/","volume":"5","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5332033/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10995297","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Origins of High Mobility and Low Operation Voltage of Amorphous Oxide TFTs: Electronic Structure, Electron Transport, Defects and Doping*","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Origins of High Mobility and Low Operation Voltage of Amorphous Oxide TFTs: Electronic Structure, Electron Transport, Defects and Doping*","sourcePdf":"jdt-tkamiya-2034559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178766S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"5331937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"5331937","articleId":"5332033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5332081,"authors":[{"name":"Imre Solti","affiliation":["Department of Medical Education and Biomedical Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA"],"firstName":"Imre","lastName":"Solti","id":"38525488200"},{"name":"Colin R.

ALI mortality is approximately 30 percent. High mortality is, in part, a consequence of delayed manual chest x-ray classification. An automated system could reduce the time to recognize ALI and lead to reductions in mortality. For our study, 96 and 857 chest x-ray reports in two corpora were labeled by domain experts for ALI. We developed a keyword and a Maximum Entropy-based classification system. Word unigram and character n-grams provided the features for the machine learning system. The Maximum Entropy algorithm with character 6-gram achieved the highest performance (Recall=0.91, Precision=0.90 and F-measure=0.91) on the 857-report corpus. This study has shown that for the classification of ALI chest x-ray reports, the machine learning approach is superior to the keyword based system and achieves comparable results to highest performing physician annotators.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314287/5332066/05332081.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated classification of radiology reports for acute lung injury: Comparison of keyword and machine learning based natural language processing approaches","doi":"10.1109/BIBMW.2009.5332081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBMW.2009.5332081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automated classification of radiology reports for acute lung injury: Comparison of keyword and machine learning based natural language processing approaches","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975547","pubMedId":"21152268","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5332081/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated classification of radiology reports for acute lung injury: Comparison of keyword and machine learning based natural language processing approaches","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"BIBMW20090604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044704S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314287","isNumber":"5332066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314287","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5332066","articleId":"5332081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5332223,"authors":[{"name":"Antonis Kalis","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology Center, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7756/5510889/5332223/5332223-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonis Kalis is an associate professor at Athens Information Technology (AIT) and an adjunct professor in the Information Networking Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

This paper presents efficient algorithms for the HW/SW partitioning problem, which has been proved to be NP-hard. We reduce the HW/SW partitioning problem to a variation of knapsack problem that is approximately solved by searching 1D solution space, instead of searching 2D solution space in the latest work cited in this paper, to reduce time complexity. Three heuristic algorithms are proposed to determine suitable partitions to satisfy HW/SW partitioning constraints.

The lower bound on the solution quality is also proposed based on the new computing model to show that it is comparable to that reported in the literature.

With data collected from 120 human annotators, we derive associations between a simple set of local code features and human notions of readability. Using those features, we construct an automated readability measure and show that it can be 80 percent effective and better than a human, on average, at predicting readability judgments. Furthermore, we show that this metric correlates strongly with three measures of software quality: code changes, automated defect reports, and defect log messages. We measure these correlations on over 2.2 million lines of code, as well as longitudinally, over many releases of selected projects.

This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel program. In the upper-level optimization, the terrorist agent maximizes the damage caused in the power system, which is measured in terms of the level of system load shed. On the other hand, in the lower-level optimization, the system operator minimizes the damage by means of an optimal operation of the power system. The distinctive modeling feature introduced in this paper is that, among the different corrective actions available, the system operator has the capability to modify the network topology. Due to its nonconvexity and nonlinearity, the resulting bilevel programming problem cannot be equivalently transformed into a standard one-level optimization problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach based on Benders decomposition within a restart framework. Some numerical results obtained by the proposed algorithm are provided and compared with those published, based on the IEEE Reliability Test System.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05332239.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Electric Grid Interdiction With Line Switching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system analysis computing","Power system modeling","Counting circuits","Load flow","Power system simulation","Power system dynamics","Power system measurements","Programming profession","Power transmission lines","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","load shedding","nonlinear programming","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric grid interdiction analysis","line switching","mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming level","upper-level optimization","power system","system load shedding","network topology","one-level optimization problem","Bender decomposition approach","IEEE reliability test system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Benders decomposition","bilevel programming","deliberate outages","line switching","load shedding","vulnerability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Electric Grid Interdiction With Line Switching","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5332239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256797","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Electric Grid Interdiction With Line Switching","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-arroyo-2032232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198469S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5332239","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":5332241,"authors":[{"name":"Dipendra Rai","affiliation":["Power Systems Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5452108/5332241/5332241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dipendra Rai (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Tribhuvan University (T.U.), Kirtipur, Nepal, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, in 2008.

Active network management (ANM) will play a major role in this but there is a continuing need to demonstrate the benefit in facilitating connection of new generation without the need for traditional reinforcements. This paper proposes a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based technique for evaluating the maximum capacity of new variable distributed generation able to be connected to a distribution network when ANM control strategies are in place. The ANM schemes embedded into the OPF include coordinated voltage control, adaptive power factor and energy curtailment. A generic U.K. medium voltage distribution network is analyzed using coincident demand and wind availability data derived from hourly time-series. Results clearly show that very high penetration levels of new variable generation capacity can be achieved by considering ANM strategies compared to the widely used passive operation (i.e., \"fit and forget\"). The effects on network losses are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5395745/05332248.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395745","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution Network Capacity Assessment: Variable DG and Active Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Wind energy generation","Wind energy","Load flow","Optimal control","Voltage control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Reactive power","Medium voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","load flow","power factor","power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network capacity assessment","variable distributed generation","active network management","multiperiod AC optimal power flow","coordinated voltage control","adaptive power factor","U.K. medium voltage distribution network","time-series","network losses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active network management","distributed generation","distribution networks","optimal power flow","wind power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distribution Network Capacity Assessment: Variable DG and Active Networks","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5332248/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11087728","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution Network Capacity Assessment: Variable DG and Active Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ochoa-2031223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091441S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5395745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"277","xplore-issue":"5395745","articleId":"5332248","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5332251,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Control and Power Research Group, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri (S'08\u2013M'09) received the B.E. degree from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College, Jalpaiguri, India, in 2003 and the M.Tech. degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, India, in 2005.

Accurate time-stamp information at both (PMU location and control center) ends offers a possibility to continuously compensate for time-varying latency. In this paper, an adaptive phasor power oscillation damping controller (APPOD) is proposed wherein the rotating coordinates for phasor extraction are adjusted to account for the change in phase caused due to the delay. The oscillatory component of the original signal is thus retrieved out of the delayed signal received at the control center. Unlike conventional phasor POD, which uses a fixed phase shift to generate damping control signal, an adaptive phase shift algorithm is used here to suit varying signal locations and operating conditions. Case studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, both in terms of robustness and handling continuously varying delays. A comparison with a conventional gain scheduled POD (CGPOD) and a Unified Smith Predictor (USP) approach is also presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05332251.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"946","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Continuous Latency Compensation With Adaptive Phasor Power Oscillation Damping Controller (POD)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Continuous Latency Compensation With Adaptive Phasor Power Oscillation Damping Controller (POD)","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5332251/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256774","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Continuous Latency Compensation With Adaptive Phasor Power Oscillation Damping Controller (POD)","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-bchaudhuri-2031908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075873S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5332251","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5332252,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanqing Xia","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Xia","id":"37293555300"},{"name":"Mengyin Fu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mengyin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37271910500"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["ILSCM, School of Engineering and Science, Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia","Faculty of Advance Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Zhaojing Wu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Information Science, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Zhaojing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278598500"},{"name":"Jinhui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinhui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407600100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5332252","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1346},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Backstepping","Control systems","Stochastic systems","Sliding mode control","Uncertainty","Stability","Linear matrix inequalities","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","continuous time systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","Markov processes","probability","stability","stochastic systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic jump system","adaptive backstepping controller design","stochastic stability","sliding mode control","linear continuous-time system","switching system","closed-loop system","probability","Markovian jump system","LMI","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","backstepping control","linear matrix inequality","Markovian jump system","stochastic stability"]}],"abstract":"In this technical note, we improve the results in a paper by Shi et al., in which problems of stochastic stability and sliding mode control for a class of linear continuous-time systems with stochastic jumps were considered. However, the system considered is switching stochastically between different subsystems, the dynamics of the jump system can not stay on each sliding surface of subsystems forever, therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the closed-loop system is stochastically stable. In this technical note, the backstepping techniques are adopted to overcome the problem in a paper by Shi et al.. The resulting closed-loop system is bounded in probability. It has been shown that the adaptive control problem for the Markovian jump systems is solvable if a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) have solutions.

This sensor requires no direct contact or use of labels on the cells, contrary to other usual types of biosensors (optical, mechanical or dc/low-frequency-detection-based ones).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332258/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11007357","volume":"57","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Broadband Microwave and Microfluidic Sensor Dedicated to Bioengineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Broadband Microwave and Microfluidic Sensor Dedicated to Bioengineering","sourcePdf":"tmtt-grenier-part2-2034226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089179S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5332258","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5332260,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, University of Ontario, Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340252/5332260/5332260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Wang (M'05) received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2000.","From 2000 to 2007, she was with COM DEV, Cambridge, ON, Canada, where she was involved in development of computer-aided design (CAD) software for design, simulation, and optimization of microwave circuits for space application.

Instead of using folded structures, dedicated coupling probes, or extra cavities, as required by conventional techniques, cross coupling is realized by changing the orientation of selected resonators. Sequential coupling between adjacent resonators and cross coupling between nonadjacent resonators are effectively controlled by introducing small metal plates at different locations. A six-pole bandpass filter with two transmission zeros was built and tested. The measurement and simulation results agree very well, demonstrating feasibility of the inline filter configuration.

Different from those based on the traveling wave principle, the new fault-location algorithm can use any section of the postfault data to locate faults. The proposed method is developed based on the distributed parameter line model in which the voltage distribution over the line can be obtained from the voltage and current measurements at both terminals and point where fault occurs can be identified from the calculated voltage distribution. The fault-location algorithm is performed in time domain and thus a short data window is sufficient for it to achieve satisfactory accuracy in practice. The proposed algorithm is simulated using data of the frequency-dependent line model in EMTDC and data of an existing HVDC line as well. The simulations have shown that this method is valid and is capable of locating the faults occurring on HVDC transmission lines quickly and accurately.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5437451/05332274.pdf","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2033078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2033078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fault-Location Method for HVDC Transmission Lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Power system stability","Fault location","Power system faults","Voltage","Power system interconnection","Frequency","Power system modeling","Control systems","Power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed parameter networks","fault location","HVDC power transmission","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-location method","HVDC transmission lines","traveling wave principle","distributed parameter line model","voltage-current measurements","short data window","frequency-dependent line model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed parameter model","fault location","HVDC transmission line","relay protection","two-terminal electrical measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fault-Location Method for HVDC Transmission Lines","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5332274/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204453","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fault-Location Method for HVDC Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-gsong-2033078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087793S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5437451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5437451","articleId":"5332274","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5332277,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Al Daoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5446467/5332277/5332277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashraf Al Daoud (S'05) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 1999, and the M.S. degree in computer systems engineering from Boston University, Boston, MA, in 2005.","He is currently a Ph.D. degree candidate in computer engineering at Boston University.

Specifically, we consider a primary license holder that aims to lease its spectrum within a certain geographic subregion of its network. Such a transaction has two contrasting economic implications: On the one hand the lessor obtains a revenue due to the exercised price of the region. On the other hand, it incurs a cost due to: (1) reduced spatial coverage of its network; and (2) possible interference from the leased region into the retained portion of its network, leading to increased call blocking. We formulate this tradeoff as an optimization problem, with the objective of profit maximization. We consider a range of pricing philosophies and derive near-optimal solutions that are based on a reduced load approximation (RLA) for estimating blocking probabilities. The form of these prices suggests charging the lessee in proportion to the fraction of admitted calls. We also exploit the special structure of the solutions to devise an efficient iterative procedure for computing prices. We present numerical results that demonstrate superiority of the proposed strategy over several alternative strategies. The results emphasize importance of effective pricing strategies in bringing secondary markets to full realization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11228768","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332277/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pricing Strategies for Spectrum Lease in Secondary Markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing Strategies for Spectrum Lease in Secondary Markets","sourcePdf":"tnet-malanyali-2031176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122475S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5446467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5446467","articleId":"5332277","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5332287,"authors":[{"name":"Laurence Bate","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5684364/5332287/5332287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Laurence Bate (M'02) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wollongong, Wollongong, N.S.W., Australia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in engineering.","He is currently with the School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong.

Furthermore, the amplitude detection of OFDM signals cannot be performed by a typical peak detector (PD) due to their high peak-to-average power ratio; as a consequence, a novel fast-settling PD is employed to solve this task. The AGC has been implemented in a low-cost 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology. Supplied at 1.8 V, it operates with a power consumption of 2.4 mW at frequencies as high as 100 MHz, while its gain ranges from 0 to 22 dB in 2-dB steps through a 5-b word.

The transformer eddy-current and proximity effects are analyzed, demonstrating that an extensive interleaving of primary and secondary windings is needed to avoid high winding losses. The analysis of transformer leakage inductance reveals that extremely low leakage inductance can be achieved, allowing stored energy to be dissipated. Power MOSFETs fully rated for repetitive avalanches allow primary-side voltage clamp circuits to be eliminated. The oversizing of the primary-switch voltage rating can thus be avoided, significantly reducing switch-conduction losses. Finally, silicon carbide rectifying diodes allow fast diode turn-off, further reducing losses. Detailed test results from a 1.5-kW full-bridge boost dc-dc converter verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate very high conversion efficiency.

We then examine the transient queue length of the buffer using the diffusion approximation. We obtain the closed-form expressions of the video quality in terms of the start-up delay, fluency of video playback and packet loss, and represent them by the network statistics, i.e., the average network throughput and delay jitter. Based on the analytical framework, we propose adaptive playout buffer management schemes to optimally manage the threshold of video playback towards the maximal user utility, according to different quality-of-service requirements of end users. The proposed framework is validated by extensive simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5353832/05332308.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2036294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2036294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Network Dynamics on User's Video Quality: Analytical Framework and QoS Provision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Throughput","Video on demand","Quality of service","Delay","Jitter","Quality management","Videoconference","Communication networks","Video sharing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","quality of service","queueing theory","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network dynamics","user perceived video quality","QoS provision","receiver playout buffer","G/G/1/\u00bf queue","G/G/1/N queue","packet arrival","transient queue length","diffusion approximation","video playback","average network throughput","delay jitter","adaptive playout buffer management","quality-of-service requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diffusion approximation","playout buffer","quality-driven"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Network Dynamics on User's Video Quality: Analytical Framework and QoS Provision","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5332308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020164","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Network Dynamics on User's Video Quality: Analytical Framework and QoS Provision","sourcePdf":"tmm-luan-2036294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5353832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5353832","articleId":"5332308","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5332309,"authors":[{"name":"Liliana de Lillo","affiliation":["Power Electronics Machines and Control Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5332309/5332309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liliana de Lillo received the M.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2006.","She is currently a Research Fellow with the Power Electronics, Machines, and Control Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, with interests in direct ac\u2013ac converters, fault-tolerant systems, more-electric aircraft applications, and ac drives."]},"firstName":"Liliana","lastName":"de Lillo","id":"37293759800"},{"name":"Lee Empringham","affiliation":["Power Electronics Machines and Control Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5332309/5332309-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Lee Empringham received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) in electrical and electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","He then joined the Power Electronics, Machines, and Control Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, to work on matrix converter commutation techniques, and since then, he has been a Research Fellow supporting different ongoing matrix converter projects.

Aerospace applications involve essentially safety-critical systems which should be able to overcome hardware or software faults and therefore need to be fault tolerant. A way of achieving this is to introduce variable degrees of redundancy into the system by duplicating one or all of the operations within the system itself. Looking at motor drives, multiphase machines, such as multiphase brushless dc machines, are considered to be good candidates in the design of fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives. This paper introduces a multiphase two-level inverter using a flexible and reliable field-programmable gate-array/digital-signal-processor controller for data acquisition, motor control, and fault monitoring to study the fault tolerance of such systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05332309.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2036026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2036026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiphase Power Converter Drive for Fault-Tolerant Machine Development in Aerospace Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Motor drives","Application software","Fault tolerant systems","Aerospace safety","Hardware","Software safety","Redundancy","DC machines","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","data acquisition","fault tolerance","machine control","motor drives","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiphase power converter drive","fault-tolerant machine development","aerospace applications","safety-critical systems","multiphase brushless dc machines","fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives","multiphase two-level inverter","field-programmable gate-array","digital-signal-processor controller","data acquisition","motor control","fault monitoring","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control of drive","converter control","digital signal processor (DSP)","multiphase drive","reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiphase Power Converter Drive for Fault-Tolerant Machine Development in Aerospace Applications","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5332309/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054655","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiphase Power Converter Drive for Fault-Tolerant Machine Development in Aerospace Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-delillo-2036026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103753S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5332309","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5332312,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel J.

The main idea of the study is that the robot movements are carried out in such a way that the length of the path traveled in the internal space, under external acoustical and mechanical constraints, is minimized. This optimum strategy defines the designed internal model, which is responsible for the robot task planning. First, an exact analytical way to deal with the problem is proposed. Next, by using some empirical findings, an approximate solution for the designed internal model is developed.

PMSM is a multivariable nonlinear system with strong interaxis couplings. A computed torque method structure is applied to PMSM. There are such uncertainties as estimated errors of the model and external perturbations, which may influence the precision of the control system. A back-propagation algorithm with additional momentum term and self-adaptive learning rate applied to feed-forward neural network can approach nonlinear functions with a learning rate adjusted online, which helps to improve training speed. In this paper, an NNI is applied to identify the uncertainties online. An adaptive-neuro-fuzzy-inference-system-based FC is applied, which has self-adaptive ability and strong robustness. Simulation results preliminarily validate that the algorithm proposed in this paper can eliminate the influences of interaxis nonlinear couplings effectively to actualize dynamic decoupling control. Furthermore, the static and dynamic performances of the control system have been improved greatly with strong robustness to uncertainties. A hypothetical microprocessor system is proposed, and simple experiments of spinning operation are carried out as a foundation for further study.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2036030","startPage":"2868","endPage":"2878","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5508599/05332328.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2036030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural-Network-Identifier and Fuzzy-Controller-Based Algorithm for Dynamic Decoupling Control of Permanent-Magnet Spherical Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Uncertainty","Neural networks","Couplings","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Torque","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electric machine analysis computing","feedforward neural nets","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","machine control","multivariable control systems","nonlinear control systems","permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-identifier","fuzzy-controller-based algorithm","permanent-magnet spherical motor","dynamic decoupling control algorithm","multivariable nonlinear system","computed torque method structure","PMSM","backpropagation algorithm","self-adaptive learning","feedforward neural network","nonlinear functions","adaptive neurofuzzy inference system","interaxis nonlinear couplings","control system","hypothetical microprocessor system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic decoupling control algorithm","fuzzy controller (FC)","neural network identifier (NNI)","online identification","permanent-magnet (PM) spherical motor (PMSM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Neural-Network-Identifier and Fuzzy-Controller-Based Algorithm for Dynamic Decoupling Control of Permanent-Magnet Spherical Motor","volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5332328/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11465104","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural-Network-Identifier and Fuzzy-Controller-Based Algorithm for Dynamic Decoupling Control of Permanent-Magnet Spherical Motor","sourcePdf":"tie-xia-2036030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138288S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5508599","articleId":"5332328","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5332332,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Muszynski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Information Engineering, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5332332/5332332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roman Muszynski received the Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees from Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland, in 1980 and 2000, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been a Professor with the Institute of Control and Information Engineering, Poznan University of Technology, where from 2002 to 2005, he was the Manager of the Division of Control and Industrial Electronics and, since 2005, has been a Research Deputy Head of the Institute.

The CR performs channel sensing to find spectrum opportunities. Conventional periodic sensing schemes require a long sensing time to detect a weak signal from the PU with fast channel-usage variation. Since the CR network should be quiet during a sensing period, a long sensing time results in low spectrum utilization. To improve spectrum utilization, we propose a novel sensing scheme that adaptively decides whether to sense the channel or to transmit the user data based on previous sensing results. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11149573","htmlLink":"/document/5332343/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sensing Technique to Maximize Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sensing Technique to Maximize Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"tvt-choi-2036631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070229S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5332343","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5332344,"authors":[{"name":"Davood Yazdani","affiliation":["Center for Energy and Power Electronics Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5443664/5332344/5332344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davood Yazdani (S\u201905\u2013M\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2009.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Center for Energy and Power Electronics Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, where he is engaged with converter-interfaced renewable energy sources.

However, the high voltage stress on switches can be a burden in high-input-voltage applications. To relieve this, a three-switch ACF (TS-ACF) converter, which employs two main switches for a forward converter and one auxiliary switch for an active-clamp circuit (ACC), is proposed in this paper. With a repositioned ACC, all the switches of TS-ACF converter have relatively low voltage stress compared to the conventional one. In addition, one of the main switches always ensures ZVS during the transformer reset. Consequently, the TS-ACF converter can be promising for high-input-voltage applications with high efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Switching converters","Low voltage","Stress","Zero voltage switching","Switching circuits","Clamps","Diodes","Moon","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-switch active-clamp forward converter","active clamp circuit","voltage stress","zero voltage switching","auxiliary switch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-clamp circuit (ACC)","active-clamp forward (ACF) converter","three-switch ACF (TS-ACF) converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05332345.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Switch Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress and Wide ZVS Range for High-Input-Voltage Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Switch Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress and Wide ZVS Range for High-Input-Voltage Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332345/","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332345/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11220608","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Switch Active-Clamp Forward Converter With Low Switch Voltage Stress and Wide ZVS Range for High-Input-Voltage Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-park-2036620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068035S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5332345","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5332347,"authors":[{"name":"Jinseok Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5443664/5332347/5332347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinseok Park (S\u201906) was born in Daegu, Korea.

For a typical PV array, the output voltage is relatively low, and a high voltage gain is obligatory to realize the grid-connected function. The proposed PV system employs a ZVT-interleaved boost converter with winding-coupled inductors and active-clamp circuits as the first power-processing stage, which can boost a low voltage of the PV array up to a high dc-bus voltage. Accordingly, an accurate steady-state model is obtained and verified by the simulation and experimental results, and a full-bridge inverter with bidirectional power flow is used as the second power-processing stage, which can stabilize the dc-bus voltage and shape the output current. Two compensation units are added to perform in the system control loops to achieve the low total harmonic distortion and fast dynamic response of the output current. Furthermore, a simple maximum-power-point-tracking method based on power balance is applied in the PV system to reduce the system complexity and cost with a high performance. At last, a 2-kW prototype has been built and tested to verify the theoretical analysis of the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05332348.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"992","endPage":"1000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332348/","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5332348/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228326","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power System","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2036432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072959S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"348","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5332348","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5332349,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik M.

In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses. Besides these ripples, undesired distortions in the average-current samples have been measured. Simulation results have revealed that these distortions are caused by a test signal, as it produces a nonzero voltage deviation from the steady-state stator voltage. In this paper, a low-speed sensorless strategy is discussed where a strong reduction of the aforementioned distortions is obtained by adapting the test signals to the steady-state stator voltage. The main assumption is that an accurate estimation of the steady-state voltage is made by using the controller output. The computation of the adaptive test signals is done by taking into account the voltage restriction of the dc-bus voltage. Simulation results, as well as experimental measurements, indicate the effectiveness of the adaptive test signals in a sensorless controlled interior PMSM.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05332349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","startPage":"875","endPage":"888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sensorless Drive by Applying Test Pulses Without Affecting the Average-Current Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sensorless Drive by Applying Test Pulses Without Affecting the Average-Current Samples","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208359","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5332349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sensorless Drive by Applying Test Pulses Without Affecting the Average-Current Samples","sourcePdf":"tpel-debelie-2036617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091401S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5332349","onlineDate":"13 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5332351,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Prabhakar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Prabhakar","id":"37669894000"},{"name":"Mahesh K.

In this presentation, author will depict three levels of detection: DNA, protein, and cell. For DNA detection, a droplet microfluidic platform enables rapid and homogenous mixing in confined picoliter volumes for molecular hybridization fluorescence images.

Too much blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) causes long-term micro-vascular complications, while a severe drop in blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) can cause life-threatening coma. Finding the right balance between quantity and type of food intake, physical activity levels and insulin dosage, is a daily challenge. Increased physical activity levels often cause changes in blood glucose due to increased glucose uptake into tissues such as muscle. To date we have limited knowledge about the minute by minute effects of exercise on blood glucose levels, in part due to the difficulty in measuring glucose and physical activity level continuously, in a free-living environment. By using a light and user-friendly armband we can record physical activity energy expenditure on a minute-by-minute basis. Simultaneously, by using a continuous glucose monitoring system we can record glucose concentrations. In this paper, Gaussian Processes are used to model the glucose excursions in response to physical activity data, to study its effect on glycaemic control.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332466","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332466.pdf","startPage":"4913","endPage":"4916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian process modelling of blood glucose response to free-living physical activity data in people with type 1 diabetes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332466/","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian process modelling of blood glucose response to free-living physical activity data in people with type 1 diabetes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983458","pubMedId":"19963637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332466/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian process modelling of blood glucose response to free-living physical activity data in people with type 1 diabetes","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"12770310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119602S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5332554,"authors":[{"name":"Haiping Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Haiping","lastName":"Lu","id":"37652585500"},{"name":"Konstantinos N.

However, CSP is based on a sample-based covariance matrix estimation. Therefore, its performance is limited when the number of available training samples is small. In this paper, the CSP method is considered in such a small-sample setting. We propose a regularized common spatial patterns (R-CSP) algorithm by incorporating the principle of generic learning. The covariance matrix estimation in R-CSP is regularized through two regularization parameters to increase the estimation stability while reducing the estimation bias due to limited number of training samples. The proposed method is tested on data set IVa of the third BCI competition and the results show that R-CSP can outperform the classical CSP algorithm by 8.5% on average. Moreover, the regularization introduced is particularly effective in the small-sample setting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332554/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332554/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992263","pubMedId":"19963675","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Regularized common spatial patterns with generic learning for EEG signal classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized common spatial patterns with generic learning for EEG signal classification","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"17011551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060772S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5332562,"authors":[{"name":"James Ning","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Ning","id":"37683983000"},{"name":"Nikolay Atanasov","affiliation":["Trinity College Dublin, Hartford, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Atanasov","id":"37670511000"},{"name":"Taikang Ning","affiliation":["Trinity College Dublin, Hartford, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Taikang","lastName":"Ning","id":"37276642600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5332562","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Signal processing","Testing","Magnetic resonance imaging","Cardiovascular system","Computed tomography","Frequency estimation","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","bioacoustics","cardiology","filtering theory","medical signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative heart sounds analysis","clinically diagnosed systolic heart murmurs","Daubechies wavelet transforms","second order AR modeling","digitized phonocardiogram","QRS waveform","heart sound recognition","wavelet-filtered signal","piecewise segmentation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Heart Auscultation","Heart Murmurs","Humans","Regression Analysis","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"A quantitative approach integrating AR modeling and wavelet transform is presented in this paper to analyze the digitized phonocardiogram.

Compressive Sampling (CS) is an emerging technique for reconstructing signals from data sampled under the Nyquist rate. CS has great potentials for low power pulse rate detection based on photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals, since by reducing the PPG data sampling rate the LEDs could be turned off for a prolonged period of time. Obviously the higher CS rate, the lower power consumption and lower pulse rate measurement accuracies. In this paper, a feasibility study of using CS for low power pulse rate detection was conducted. A miniature PPG measurement device based on our body sensor networks platform was employed for signal acquisition. Experiments for evaluation the pulse rate estimation and the power consumption were completed. Results suggested that the Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction (GPSR) algorithm is a highly efficient for retrieving pulse rate from PPG signals. It was suggested that the CS rate should be approximate 3 for low power pulse rate detections with averaging estimation mean-square error being less than 5.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332700","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332700.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"756","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pilot study on low power pulse rate detection based on compressive sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A pilot study on low power pulse rate detection based on compressive sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5332700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992433","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","pubMedId":"19963730","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pilot study on low power pulse rate detection based on compressive sampling","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01992040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044646S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5332701,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa H.

The initiation of the HFAC produces an onset response in the nerve before complete block occurs. An amplitude ramp, starting from zero amplitude, is ineffective in eliminating this onset response. In fact, it makes the onset worse. We postulated that initiating the ramp from a non-zero amplitude would produce a different effect on the onset. This was tested in an in-vivo rat sciatic nerve model. HFAC was applied at supra block threshold amplitudes and then reduced to a lower amplitude (0%, 25% 50 %, 75% and 90% of the suprathreshold amplitude). The amplitude was then increased again to the original supra block threshold amplitude. This normally produces a second period of onset response if increased as a step. However, an amplitude ramp was successful in eliminating this onset. This was always possible for the ramps up from 50%, 75 % and 90% block threshold amplitude, but never from 0% or 25% of the block threshold amplitude. This maneuver can potentially be used to maintain complete nerve block, transition to partial block and then resume complete block without initiating another onset.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Animals","Biomedical imaging","Leg","Muscles","Tendons","AC motors","Biomedical engineering","USA Councils","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurophysiology","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["onset response reduction","high frequency nerve block","amplitude ramp","high frequency alternating current waveforms","mammalian peripheral nerves","rat sciatic nerve model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Action Potentials","Animals","Electric Stimulation","Electromagnetic Fields","Nerve Block","Neural Conduction","Neural Conduction","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Sciatic Nerve","Sciatic Nerve","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332735","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332735.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of the onset response in high frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of the onset response in high frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332735/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332735/","accessionNumber":"10992449","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","pubMedId":"19963720","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of the onset response in high frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01740805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035801S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5332757,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew A.

During routine vascular surgeries, an 8-contact FINE was placed around the common femoral nerve between the inguinal ligament and the first branching point. The efficacy of the FINE to selectively recruit muscles innervated by the femoral nerve was determined from electromyograms (EMGs) recorded in response to electrical stimulation. At least four of the six muscles innervated by the femoral nerve were selectively recruited in all subjects. Of these, at least one muscle was a hip flexor and two muscles were knee extensors. Results from the intraoperative experiments were used to estimate the potential for the electrode to restore knee extension and hip flexion through Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Normalized EMGs and biomechanical simulations were used to estimate joint moments and functional efficacy. Estimated knee extension moments exceed the threshold required for the sit-to-stand transition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intraoperative Demonstration of Selective Stimulation of the Common Human Femoral Nerve with a FINE","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332757","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332757.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intraoperative Demonstration of Selective Stimulation of the Common Human Femoral Nerve with a FINE","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332757/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983695","pubMedId":"19963718","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intraoperative Demonstration of Selective Stimulation of the Common Human Femoral Nerve with a FINE","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01640475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104431S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5332815,"authors":[{"name":"Hyejung Kim","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyejung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292768600"},{"name":"Refet Firat Yazicioglu","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Refet Firat","lastName":"Yazicioglu","id":"37294493000"},{"name":"Tom Torfs","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Torfs","id":"37296247000"},{"name":"Patrick Merken","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Merken","id":"37294493900"},{"name":"Chris Van Hoof","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Van Hoof","id":"37296240600"},{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoi-Jun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37274307200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5332815","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Electrostatic precipitators","Electrocardiography","Signal processing","Filtering","Cryptography","Data compression","Skeleton","Huffman coding","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","data compression","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit","wireless ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring systems","ECG signal processor","data compression flow","modified Huffman coding","transmission energy consumption reduction","ESP IC"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Arrhythmias, Cardiac","Electrocardiography","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Telemetry"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332815","abstract":"An ECG signal processor (ESP) is proposed for the low energy wireless ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring system.

Motor decoding algorithms, which map neural spiking data to control parameters of a device such as a prosthetic arm, have received particular attention in the literature. Here, we highlight several outstanding problems that exist in most current approaches to decode algorithm design. These include two problems that we argue will unlikely result in further dramatic increases in performance, specifically spike sorting and spiking models. We also discuss three issues that have been less examined in the literature, and we argue that addressing these issues may result in dramatic future increases in performance. These include: non-stationarity of recorded waveforms, limitations of a linear mappings between neural activity and movement kinematics, and the low signal to noise ratio of the neural data. We demonstrate these problems with data from 39 experimental sessions with a non-human primate performing reaches and with recent literature. In all, this study suggests that research in cortically-controlled prosthetic systems may require reprioritization to achieve performance that is acceptable for a clinically viable human system.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332822","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332822.pdf","startPage":"3369","endPage":"3375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural prosthetic systems: Current problems and future directions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332822/","displayDocTitle":"Neural prosthetic systems: Current problems and future directions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983957","pubMedId":"19963796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332822/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural prosthetic systems: Current problems and future directions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"08841770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08093S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5332828,"authors":[{"name":"J. del R.

The results presented here show the possibility of controlling multiple degrees of freedom at once.

The feasibility and the advantage of the proposed cluster-structured PSO are demonstrated through numerical simulations using four typical optimization test problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-structured Particle Swarm Optimization with interaction","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05332881.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-structured Particle Swarm Optimization with interaction","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332881/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-structured Particle Swarm Optimization with interaction","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"1B133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062016S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5332881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5332889,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Minami","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Maizuru National College of Technology, Maizuru, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Minami","id":"37285682800"},{"name":"Shun-ichi Azuma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun-ichi","lastName":"Azuma","id":"37299252200"},{"name":"Toshiharu Sugie","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiharu","lastName":"Sugie","id":"37278824000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5332889","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Sampling methods","Closed-form solution","Filtering theory","Actuators","Vectors","Control engineering","Educational institutions","Informatics","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIMO control systems","multirate-sampling based approach","linear control systems","discrete-valued signal constraints","optimal dynamic quantizer","optimal design problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantized control","dynamic quantizer","non-minimum phase","multirate sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332889","abstract":"In this paper, we present multirate sampling type dynamic quantizers for linear control systems with discrete-valued signal constraints.

NB is a pediatric tumor of sympathetic nervous system and current evaluation of NB tumor histology is done according to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification. The number of cells undergoing either mitosis or karyorrhexis (MK) plays an important role in this classification system. However, manual counting of such cells is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra-reader variations. A computer-assisted system may allow more precise results leading to more accurate prognosis in clinical practice. In this study, we propose an image analysis approach that operates on digitized NB histology samples. Based on the likelihood functions estimated from the samples of manually marked regions, we compute the probability map that indicates how likely a pixel belongs to an MK cell. Component-wise 2-step thresholding of the generated probability map provides promising results in detecting MK cells with an average sensitivity of 81.1% and 12.2 false positive detections on average.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332910","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05332910.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium","Neoplasms","Cancer","Image color analysis","Image texture analysis","Sympathetic nervous system","Pathology","USA Councils","Tumors","Microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","cellular biophysics","image classification","image segmentation","medical image processing","neurophysiology","paediatrics","probability","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer-aided prognosis","mitosis cell detection","karyorrhexis cell detection","digitized histological images","histopathological examination","patient prognosis","pediatric tumor","sympathetic nervous system","International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification","inter-reader variation","intra-reader variation","computer-assisted system","image analysis approach","likelihood functions","probability map generation","component-wise 2-step thresholding","false positive detection"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cell Death","Child","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Likelihood Functions","Mitosis","Neuroblastoma","Prognosis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided Prognosis of Neuroblastoma: Detection of Mitosis and Karyorrhexis Cells in Digitized Histological Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332910/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332910/","accessionNumber":"10983871","isStaticHtml":true,"pubMedId":"19963746","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided Prognosis of Neuroblastoma: Detection of Mitosis and Karyorrhexis Cells in Digitized Histological Images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"03771115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06059S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5332910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5332962,"authors":[{"name":"Benhui Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Benhui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600010900"},{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37677491300"},{"name":"Jinglu Hu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Jinglu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37278204200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5332962","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic design automation and methodology","Proteins","Computational efficiency","Sequences","Evolutionary computation","Predictive models","Lattices","Genetic mutations","Production systems","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backtracking","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backtracking method","evolutionary algorithm","EDAs-based protein folding","protein structure prediction","HP-lattice model","geometrical constraints","protein conformation","protein sequences","estimation-of-distribution algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Protein structure prediction (PSP)","HP model","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs)","Backtracking"]}],"abstract":"Many evolutionary algorithm (EA) based methods have been proposed to solve protein structure prediction (PSP) problem in HP-lattice model. One of common difficulties of those methods is the existence of invalid individuals produced by geometrical constraints in the conformation of protein (i.e. self-avoidance in the chain). A backtracking method is often used to repair the invalid individuals of genetic search in those methods. However, there is a disadvantage in basic backtracking method, the repairing computational cost is very heavy for long sequence instances. This paper proposes an improved backtracking-based repairing method for long sequence protein folding. A detection procedure is added in backtracking method to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of backtracking searching operations and the computational cost for the long protein sequences.","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05332962.pdf","startPage":"4669","endPage":"4674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved backtracking method for EDAs based protein folding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5332962/","displayDocTitle":"An improved backtracking method for EDAs based protein folding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10982740","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5332962/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved backtracking method for EDAs based protein folding","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"4B055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060305S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5332962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5332989,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuro Matsui","affiliation":["Fuji Electric Advanced Technology Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuro","lastName":"Matsui","id":"37086070115"},{"name":"Yasuo Nakahara","affiliation":["Fuji Electric Systems Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasuo Nakahara","id":"37087658935"},{"name":"Kazuo Nishiyama","affiliation":["Fuji Electric Systems Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazuo Nishiyama","id":"37087657138"},{"name":"Noboru Urabe","affiliation":["Fuji Electric Systems Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Noboru Urabe","id":"37087658793"},{"name":"Masayoshi Itoh","affiliation":["Fuji Electric Chiba Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"lastName":"Masayoshi Itoh","id":"37087658592"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5332989","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remaining life assessment","Oil insulation","Neural networks","Power transformer insulation","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Life estimation","Wire","Cable insulation","Petroleum","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maintenance engineering","neural nets","power engineering computing","power transformer insulation","remaining life assessment","transformer oil","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remaining life assessment","oil-immersed transformer","structured neural network","winding insulation paper deterioration","ensemble technique","transformer replacement","transformer maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["oil-immersed transformer","remaining life assessment","average degree of polymerization","furfural","artificial neural network","ensemble"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332989","abstract":"Remaining Life of the oil-immersed transformer is decided due to deterioration of the winding insulation paper.

The training phase, calculating the neural networks weights, is accomplished for a new proposed geometrical method to solve the problem of multi-solution caused by redundancy. The use of this geometrical method results in one solution among the infinite solutions of the inverse kinematics of the redundant manipulators. This method is very effective for avoiding the singularity problem because it guarantees that there is no lining up for two or more links. Another advantage for this method is that the angles between the links will be set between two maximum and minimum values. This means that the end-effecter can reach any point on the desired path and the angles between the links will not be less than the minimum limit or more than the maximum limit, which makes this method effective for joint limits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method, experiments were conducted on an 8 links hyper redundant manipulator in this paper.

Specific attention is given to mixed-signal design approaches and their impact on the overall system power dissipation. Examples of trade-offs in power dissipation between analog front-ends and digital signal processing are also given. It is shown how signal filtering can further reduce the internal power consumption of a node. Such power saving approaches are indispensable as real-life tests of custom wireless ECG patches reveal the need for artifact detection and correction. The power consumption of such additional features has to come from power savings elsewhere in the system as the overall power budget cannot increase.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-low-power wearable biopotential sensor nodes","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333154","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333154.pdf","startPage":"3205","endPage":"3208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-low-power wearable biopotential sensor nodes","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333154/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992949","pubMedId":"19964056","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-low-power wearable biopotential sensor nodes","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"08401371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070455S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333156,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","firstName":"Hoi-Jun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37274307200"},{"name":"Namjun Cho","firstName":"Namjun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37286042800"},{"name":"Jerald Yoo","firstName":"Jerald","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37292165500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5333156","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":571},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low energy wearable body-sensor-network","abstract":"Wearable body sensor network (WBSN) is realized with wireless and wireline techniques.

The four neurons implement a generalized Hodgkin-Huxley model with individually configurable rate-based kinetics of opening and closing of Na+ and K+ ion channels. The twelve synapses implement a rate-based first-order kinetic model of neurotransmitter and receptor dynamics, accounting for NMDA and non-NMDA type chemical synapses. The implemented models on the chip are fully configurable by 384 parameters accounting for conductances, reversal potentials, and pre/post-synaptic voltage-dependence of the channel kinetics. We describe the models and present experimental results from the chip characterizing single neuron dynamics, single synapse dynamics, and multi-neuron network dynamics showing phase-locking behavior as a function of synaptic coupling strength. The 3 mm times 3 mm microchip consumes 1.29 mW power making it promising for applications including neuromorphic modeling and neural prostheses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biophysical synaptic dynamics in an analog VLSI network of hodgkin-huxley neurons","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333272","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333272.pdf","startPage":"3335","endPage":"3338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Biophysical synaptic dynamics in an analog VLSI network of hodgkin-huxley neurons","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333272/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992874","pubMedId":"19964071","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biophysical synaptic dynamics in an analog VLSI network of hodgkin-huxley neurons","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"08742089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056914S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5333275,"authors":[{"name":"Ude Lu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ude","lastName":"Lu","id":"37592563600"},{"name":"Dong Song","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Song","id":"37333901600"},{"name":"Theodore W.

The role of neural networks is to compensate for constructing a linearized model so as to minimize the output error caused by nonlinearities in the control system. The neural networks use the backpropagation algorithm for the learning process. The role of simple adaptive controller is to perform the model matching for the linear system with unknown structures to a given linear reference model. In this method, only part of the control input is fed to the PFC. Thus, the proposed method will reduce the offset error, and both of the augmented plant output and the real plant output can follow significantly close to the output of the reference model.

This paper presents a phenomenological characterization of the steering behavior of pre-curved needles, which have tip asymmetry due to curvature of the needle near the tip. We describe needle construction methods and a needle shaft triangulation algorithm to compute the shape of the needle based on images. Experimental results show that pre-curved needles possess greater dexterity than bevel-tipped needles and achieve radii of curvature similar to pre-bent needles. For long pre-curve arc lengths, the radius of curvature of the needle was found to approach the radius of curvature of the pre-curve. Pre-curved needles were found to display behaviors not seen with bevel-tipped needles, such as the insertion velocity influencing the path of the tip within the tissue and the ability to plastically deform the needle during steering.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333407.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1203","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of pre-curved needles for steering in tissue","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Needles","Shape","Biomedical imaging","Biomedical engineering","USA Councils","Biological tissues","Shafts","Displays","Motion control","Path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomechanics","needles","patient treatment","plastic deformation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-curved needle characterization","tissue steering","tip asymmetry","phenomenological characterization","needle construction method","needle shaft triangulation algorithm","needle curvature","plastic deformation","needle deflection","bevel-tipped needles"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biomedical Engineering","Equipment Design","Humans","Needles","Phantoms, Imaging","Robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of pre-curved needles for steering in tissue","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984179","pubMedId":"19963994","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of pre-curved needles for steering in tissue","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"03142081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086063S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333428,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia J.

One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and problem solving. In this paper, we present LSAView, a system for interactively exploring parameter choices for LSA models. We illustrate the use of LSAView's small multiple views, linked matrix-graph views, and data views to analyze parameter selection and application in the context of graph layout and clustering.","doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333428","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312461/5332407/05333428.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LSAView: A tool for visual exploration of latent semantic modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"LSAView: A tool for visual exploration of latent semantic modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976372","htmlLink":"/document/5333428/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LSAView: A tool for visual exploration of latent semantic modeling","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"083090crossno.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056458S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312461","isNumber":"5332407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312461","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5332407","articleId":"5333428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5333443,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Collins","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Collins","id":"37669874100"},{"name":"Fernanda B.

The filter can be derived from a discretized 2D impulse response model in the region of interest (ROI). The key to the robustness of the regularized 2D pseudoinverse filter is transforming the operator to k-space, where the regularized inversion is implemented using 2D DFT instead of computationally intractable matrix operations. Using computer simulations, the 2D PIO was shown to produce complete restoration of contrast loss due to grating lobes resulting from coarse, 2lambda sampling of HFUS arrays in the 25-35 MHz range. In this paper, we present the first in vivo demonstration of the 2D PIO in imaging the carotid artery using a commercially available probe. The results show that the 2D PIO increases the tissue/blood contrast by 4 dB (when imaging a cross section of the vessel). These results are in agreement with experimental results obtained using the same probe in imaging quality assurance phantoms. The 2D PIO's ability to remove the clutter from grating lobe is expected to improve the performance of speckle tracking algorithms for the estimation of tissue and blood displacements in vivo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333460/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10992161","pubMedId":"19964018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333460/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 2D post-beamforming filter for contrast restoration in medical ultrasound: in vivo results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2D post-beamforming filter for contrast restoration in medical ultrasound: in vivo results","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"05050932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077182S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333477,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In general, the LZ complexity has been used to determine the complexity grade present in biomedical signals. The LZ complexity is not able to discern between signals with different amplitude variations and similar random components. On the other hand, amplitude parameters, as the root mean square (RMS), are not able to discern between signals with similar power distributions and different random components. In this work, we present a novel method to quantify amplitude and complexity variations in biomedical signals by means of the computation of the LZ coefficient using more than two quantification states, and with thresholds fixed and independent of the dynamic range or standard deviation of the analyzed signal: the multistate Lempel-Ziv (MLZ) index. Our results indicate that MLZ index with few quantification levels only evaluate the complexity changes of the signal, with high number of levels, the amplitude variations, and with an intermediate number of levels informs about both amplitude and complexity variations. The study performed in diaphragmatic mechanomyographic signals shows that the amplitude variations of this signal are more correlated with the respiratory effort than the complexity variations. Furthermore, it has been observed that the MLZ index with high number of levels practically is not affected by the existence of impulsive, sinusoidal, constant and Gaussian noises compared with the RMS amplitude parameter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5333488/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984090","pubMedId":"19964107","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multistate Lempel-Ziv (MLZ) index interpretation as a measure of amplitude and complexity changes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistate Lempel-Ziv (MLZ) index interpretation as a measure of amplitude and complexity changes","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"11421520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055554S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333527,"authors":[{"name":"Yu M.

The coin sized sensor capacitively couples to the scalp without direct contact to the skin. To minimize the effect of signal attenuation and channel gain mismatch, the input capacitance of each sensor is actively neutralized using positive feedback and bootstrapping. Common-mode suppression is achieved through a single conductive sheet to establish a common mode reference. Each sensor electrode provides a differential gain of 60 dB. Signals are transmitted in a digital serial daisy-chain directly from a local 16-bit ADC, minimizing the number of wires required to establish a high density EEG sensor network. The micropower electrode consumes only 600 muW from a single 3.3 V supply.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333527","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333527.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","startPage":"4218","endPage":"4221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micropower non-contact EEG electrode with active common-mode noise suppression and input capacitance cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Micropower non-contact EEG electrode with active common-mode noise suppression and input capacitance cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333527/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983665","pubMedId":"19964104","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5333527/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micropower non-contact EEG electrode with active common-mode noise suppression and input capacitance cancellation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"10982119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058507S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333534,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Joye","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Joye","id":"37681445100"},{"name":"Alexandre Schmid","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37276559400"},{"name":"Yusuf Leblebici","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Leblebici","id":"37276561900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5333534","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microelectrodes","Electrodes","Circuit noise","Impedance","Electric variables","Semiconductor device modeling","Power system modeling","Neurons","Equivalent circuits","Electric resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesion","bioelectric phenomena","biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","cellular biophysics","CMOS integrated circuits","microelectrodes","neurophysiology","platinum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell-electrode interface noise model","high-density microelectrode arrays","electrical characteristics","CMOS-based MEA electronics","black electrodes","platinum electrode noise","neural cell adhesion","neural activity measurement","Pt"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Amplifiers, Electronic","Computer Simulation","Electrodes","Electronics, Medical","Equipment Design","Humans","Microelectrodes","Models, Neurological","Neurons","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333534","abstract":"A cell-electrode interface noise model is developed which is dedicated to enable the co-simulation of the cell-electrode electrical characteristics, along with the electronics of novel CMOS-based MEA.

The BCG signal can change considerably under various physiological states; however, little information exists in literature describing how these forces are generated. A physical analysis is presented using a finite element model of thoracic aortic vasculature to quantify forces generated by the blood flow during the cardiac cycle. The traction at the fluid-solid interface of this deformable wall model generates a central aortic force (CAF) which appears of similar magnitude to recorded BCG forces. The increased pulse pressure in an exercise simulation caused a significant increase in CAF, which is consistent with recent BCG measurements in exercise recovery.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333577","startPage":"2831","endPage":"2834","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333577.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of central aortic forces in the ballistocardiogram under rest and exercise conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force measurement","Blood flow","Deformable models","Pulse measurements","Computational modeling","Computational fluid dynamics","Biomedical engineering","Tensile stress","USA Councils","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","cardiovascular system","computational fluid dynamics","finite element analysis","force","haemodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["central aortic force","ballistocardiogram","cardiac ejection","blood","finite element model","thoracic aortic vasculature","blood flow","fluid-solid interface","exercise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cardiovascular monitoring","computational modeling","non-invasive diagnostics","hemodynamics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Anisotropy","Aorta","Ballistocardiography","Ballistocardiography","Biomedical Engineering","Carotid Arteries","Computer Simulation","Elasticity","Electrochemistry","Equipment Design","Models, Theoretical","Physical Conditioning, Animal","Rest","Stress, Mechanical","Swine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of central aortic forces in the ballistocardiogram under rest and exercise conditions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10983908","pubMedId":"19964271","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of central aortic forces in the ballistocardiogram under rest and exercise conditions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"07451198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052154S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5333584,"authors":[{"name":"Indra Adji Sulistijono","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Indra Adji","lastName":"Sulistijono","id":"37296205200"},{"name":"Anhar Risnumawan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Anhar","lastName":"Risnumawan","id":"37681265400"},{"name":"Cynthia Rachmanita","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Rachmanita","id":"37681263000"},{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37275324300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5333584","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333584","abstract":"This work deals with human-friendly trajectory generation of an arm robot. Various methods for the trajectory generation have been proposed so far, but robots must deal with environments including human operators. In this situation, the robot should take a suitable action/motion to the individual operator. This work applies an interactive particle swarm optimization for the trajectory generation using human evaluation. Particle Swarm Optimization offer multiple sets of candidate trajectory and then the best one is shown to the human to be evaluated. Basically human evaluation is very important for generating robotic behavior, but the detail of the human evaluation is not clear. Furthermore, to reduce the number of the human evaluations, a state-value function is used. Therefore, we can search for good trajectory candidates with the estimated human evaluation. The experimental results show that the state-value function can estimate the human evaluation.","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05333584.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-friendly arm robot using interactive particle swarm optimization for trajectory generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Human robot interaction","Particle swarm optimization","Mobile robots","Design engineering","Motion control","Orbital robotics","State estimation","Motion planning","Electronic mail","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-friendly arm robot","interactive particle swarm optimization","trajectory generation","human evaluation","robotic behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human-friendly Arm Robot","Interactive Particle Swarm Optimization","State-value function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Human-friendly arm robot using interactive particle swarm optimization for trajectory generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333584/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10982625","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-friendly arm robot using interactive particle swarm optimization for trajectory generation","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"1A123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050317S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5333584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5333610,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanpeng Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhanpeng","lastName":"Jin","id":"37404401000"},{"name":"Yuwen Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuwen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404471500"},{"name":"Allen C.

The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures the electrical activities of the heart from the body surface. However, heart rhythm irregularities cannot always be detected on a standard resting ECG machine, since they may not occur during an individual's recording session. Common Holter-based portable solutions that record ECG for up to 24 to 48 hours lack the capability to provide real-time feedback. In this research, we seek to establish a cell phone-based real-time monitoring technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous on-line ECG processing, generating a personalized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting and classifying abnormal CVD conditions, all in real time. Specifically, we developed an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both an individual's cardiac characteristics and information from clinical ECG databases, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification on cell phones.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cardiovascular diseases","Condition monitoring","Machine learning","Cellular phones","Electrocardiography","Heart","Electric variables measurement","Rhythm","Neurofeedback","Computerized monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","electrocardiography","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","patient monitoring","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular disease","real time electrocardiographic monitoring","adaptive machine learning","cell phone","Holter based portable solutions","artificial neural network","time 24 hour to 48 hour"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Cardiovascular Diseases","Cellular Phone","Electrocardiography","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Time Factors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333610","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333610.pdf","startPage":"6889","endPage":"6892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting cardiovascular disease from real-time electrocardiographic monitoring: An adaptive machine learning approach on a cell phone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting cardiovascular disease from real-time electrocardiographic monitoring: An adaptive machine learning approach on a cell phone","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333610/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333610/","accessionNumber":"10984144","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","pubMedId":"19964449","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting cardiovascular disease from real-time electrocardiographic monitoring: An adaptive machine learning approach on a cell phone","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"17742030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048461S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5333615,"authors":[{"name":"Lawrence K.

The major drawback is the high power consumption of an UWB receiver. One solution to address this problem is to use a transmit-only UWB sensor node. In this paper, we propose a multi-access scheme that is suitable for asynchronous transmit-only UWB wireless body area networks (UWB-WBAN). Each sensor attached on the patient under monitoring is assigned a unique number of UWB pulses per data bit. The number of UWB pulses assigned to the sensors is optimized to improve the bit error rate and system reliability. Simulation shows that through careful selection of the number of pulses for the sensors, it is possible to maintain almost similar bit error probability, regardless of the distance from the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333616","startPage":"6906","endPage":"6909","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333616.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a multi-access scheme and asynchronous transmit-only UWB for wireless body area networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333616/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a multi-access scheme and asynchronous transmit-only UWB for wireless body area networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333616/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10983446","pubMedId":"19964453","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a multi-access scheme and asynchronous transmit-only UWB for wireless body area networks","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"17781415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040839S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5333628,"authors":[{"name":"Guanglin Li","affiliation":["Neural Engineering Center of Artificial Limbs, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Northwestern University, IL, USA","Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Guanglin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405541900"},{"name":"Todd A Kuiken","affiliation":["Neural Engineering Center of Artificial Limbs, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Northwestern University, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Todd A","lastName":"Kuiken","id":"37265987600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5333628","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":810},"abstract":"Electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition approach has been investigated widely with able-bodied subjects for control of multifunctional prostheses and verified with high performance in identifying different movements. However, it remains unclear whether transradial amputees can achieve similar performance. In this study, we investigated the performance of EMG pattern recognition control of multifunctional transradial prostheses in five subjects with unilateral below-elbow amputation. Testing results on both residual and intact arms showed that the average classification error (21%) of amputated arms for ten motion classes (four wrist movements, six hand grasps) and a `no movement' class over all five subjects was about 15% higher than that of intact arms. For six basic motion classes (wrist flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, and hand open/close), the average classification error over all five subjects was about 7% from residual arms, which was similar to the result from intact arms (6%). Only six optimal electrode channels might be needed to provide an excellent myoelectric control system for the six basic movements. These results suggest that the muscles in the residual forearm may produce sufficient myoelectric information to allow the six basic motion control, but insufficient information for more hand functions with fine finger movements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Pattern recognition","Prosthetics","Arm","Wrist","Testing","Electrodes","Optimal control","Control systems","Muscles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical electrodes","electromyography","medical control systems","medical signal processing","motion control","prosthetics","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMG pattern recognition control","electromyogram","multifunctional prostheses","transradial amputee","unilateral below-elbow amputation","classification error","electrode channels","myoelectric control system","motion control","hand function","finger movement"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Amputees","Artificial Limbs","Biomedical Engineering","Electrodes","Electromyography","Humans","Middle Aged","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Prosthesis Design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333628","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333628.pdf","startPage":"6914","endPage":"6917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMG pattern recognition control of multifunctional prostheses by transradial amputees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EMG pattern recognition control of multifunctional prostheses by transradial amputees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333628/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333628/","accessionNumber":"10992463","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","pubMedId":"19964455","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMG pattern recognition control of multifunctional prostheses by transradial amputees","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"17800245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044351S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5333635,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni Georga","affiliation":["Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina (UoI), Greece"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Georga","id":"37590437700"},{"name":"Vasilios Protopappas","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, University of Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasilios","lastName":"Protopappas","id":"37399560800"},{"name":"Alejandra Guillen","affiliation":["Department of Service Solutions from CRDM in Medtronic Spain, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Guillen","id":"37590774300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Fico","affiliation":["Lifestyle Supporting Technologies Group, Technical University Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Fico","id":"37586607600"},{"name":"Diego Ardigo","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Parma, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Ardigo","id":"37590407300"},{"name":"Maria Teresa Arredondo","affiliation":["Lifestyle Supporting Technologies Group, Technical University Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria Teresa","lastName":"Arredondo","id":"37272108400"},{"name":"Themis P.

METABO provides a multi-parametric monitoring system which facilitates the efficient and systematic recording of dietary, physical activity, medication and medical information (continuous and discontinuous glucose measurements). Based on all recorded contextual information, data mining schemes that run in the PMD are responsible to model patients' metabolism, predict hypo/hyper-glycaemic events, and provide the patient with short and long-term alerts. In addition, all past and recently-recorded data are analyzed to extract patterns of behavior, discover new knowledge and provide explanations to the physician through the CP.

We used a genetic algorithm (GA) that mimics biological evolution to determine the energy-optimal waveform shape for neural stimulation. The GA was coupled to NEURON using a model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. Stimulation waveforms represented the organisms of a population, and each waveform's shape was encoded into genes. The fitness of each waveform was based on its energy efficiency and ability to elicit an action potential. After each generation of the GA, waveforms mated to produce offspring waveforms, and a new population was formed consisting of the offspring and the fittest waveforms of the previous generation. Over the course of the GA, waveforms became increasingly energy-efficient and converged upon a highly energy-efficient shape. The resulting waveforms resembled truncated normal curves or sinusoids and were 3-74% more energy-efficient than several waveform shapes commonly used in neural stimulation. If implemented in implantable neural stimulators, the GA optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgery.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333722","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333722.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"637","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the

In-home monitoring technology brings the added benefit of measuring individualized health status and reporting it to the care provider and caregivers alike, allowing timely and targeted preventive interventions, even in home and community based settings. This paper presents a paradigm for geriatric care based on monitoring older adults passively in their own living settings through placing sensors in their living environments or the objects they use. Activity and physiological data can be analyzed, archived and mined to detect indicators of early disease onset or changes in health conditions at various levels. Examples of monitoring systems are discussed and results from field evaluation pilot studies are summarized. The approach has shown great promise for a significant value proposition to all the stakeholders involved in caring for older adults. The paradigm would allow care providers to extend their services into the communities they serve.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","Remote monitoring","Diseases","Geriatrics","Data analysis","Intelligent sensors","Communications technology","Artificial intelligence","Technology management","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","geriatrics","patient care","patient monitoring","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive in-home health","wellness monitoring","modern sensor","communication technology","remote management","chronic disease","geriatric care","older adults","physiological data","disease","stakeholders"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Accidental Falls","Activities of Daily Living","Aged","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Communication Networks","Home Care Services","Humans","Medical Informatics","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Monitoring, Physiologic","Monitoring, Physiologic","Polysomnography","Telemedicine","Telemedicine","Telemetry","Transducers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333799","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333799.pdf","startPage":"4307","endPage":"4310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive in-home health and wellness monitoring: Overview, value and examples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Passive in-home health and wellness monitoring: Overview, value and examples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333799/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333799/","accessionNumber":"10992419","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","pubMedId":"19964350","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive in-home health and wellness monitoring: Overview, value and examples","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"11220244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042925S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":5333826,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This approach has been tested and properly adapted to work onto the underactuated robotic hand named CyberHand, using mouse cursor coordinates as input signals and a principal components (PCs) matrix taken from the literature. First trials show the feasibility of performing grasps using this method.

Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations for metrics and techniques for evaluating other visual analytics investigative analysis tools.","doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333878","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312461/5332407/05333878.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis: Deriving design principles from a case study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis: Deriving design principles from a case study","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976349","htmlLink":"/document/5333878/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis: Deriving design principles from a case study","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"139146kang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108351S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312461","isNumber":"5332407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312461","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5332407","articleId":"5333878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5333909,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ju Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Ju","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37574503800"},{"name":"Jong Pil Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Pil","lastName":"Yun","id":"37634894200"},{"name":"Doo-chul Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Doo-chul","lastName":"Choi","id":"37578184700"},{"name":"Sang Woo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Woo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279286000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5333909","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Detection algorithms","Steel","Billets","Surface morphology","Surface cracks","Inspection","Manufacturing","Image processing","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["billets","crack detection","discrete wavelet transforms","image processing","quality control","steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defect detection","corner cracks","steel billet","discrete wavelet transform","steel surfaces","quality control","steel products","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["defect detection","steel billet","wavelet","corner crack","visual inspection"]}],"abstract":"The detection of defects on steel surfaces is an important quality control step in the manufacturing of steel products. In this study, we developed an algorithm to detect defects such as corner cracks in steel billets through the use of image processing techniques.

Because these scales visually similar to corner cracks, and because the surface features of billet images vary under different lighting conditions, defect detection can be difficult. To minimize the influence of scales and to improve the accuracy of detection, a new detection method based on discrete wavelet transform is proposed.

Therapists and physicians have to infer the effectiveness of rehabilitation approaches from observations performed in the clinical setting and from patients' feedback. Recent advances in wearable technology have provided means to supplement the information gathered using tools based on patient's direct observation as well as interviews and questionnaires. A new generation of wearable sensors and systems has recently become available thus providing clinical personnel with a ldquowindow of observationrdquo in the home and community settings. These tools allow one to capture patients' activity level and exercise compliance, facilitate titration of medications in chronic patients, and provide means to assess the ability of patients to perform specific motor activities. In this paper, we review recent advances in the field of wearable technology and provide examples of application of this technology in rehabilitation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","Wearable sensors","Body sensor networks","Parkinson's disease","Biosensors","Patient monitoring","Clothing","Intelligent sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Propulsion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","body area networks","health care","patient rehabilitation","telemedicine","wearable computers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable technology","rehabilitation intervention","patient feedback","wearable sensors","clinical personnel","patient activity level","exercise compliance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Parkinson Disease","Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","Stroke"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333997","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05333997.pdf","startPage":"6580","endPage":"6583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clinical applications of wearable technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clinical applications of wearable technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5333997/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5333997/","accessionNumber":"10992272","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","pubMedId":"19964699","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clinical applications of wearable technology","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"16942017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066443S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5333997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5334009,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It suffers from intra- and inter-user variability. Computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) helps to reduce such variations and speed up the diagnostic process. In this paper, we propose an automatic computer assisted diagnostic system for renal cell carcinoma subtype classification using scale invariant features. We capture the morphological distinctness of various subtypes and we have used them to classify a heterogeneous data set of renal cell carcinoma biopsy images. Our technique does not require color segmentation and minimizes human intervention. We circumvent user subjectivity using automated analysis and cater for intra-class heterogeneities using multiple class templates. We achieve a classification accuracy of 83% using a Bayesian classifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology

important. Using the machine learning method for this classification is effective, but constructing feature vectors with all data points might result in very high-dimensional data. Because such redundant features are undesirable from the viewpoint of computation and classification performance, EEG has been downsampled in several studies. In the present study, we propose a new downsampling method aiming at the improvement of P300 classification accuracy. In particular, each single trial EEG is segmented at non-uniform intervals and then averaged in each segment. The segmentation is decided in such a way that the degree of separating two classes from training data is increased by applying a time series segmentation algorithm. Our experiment using the BCI Competition III P300 Speller paradigm data set demonstrated that our method resulted in higher accuracy than traditional downsampling methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5334054/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984209","pubMedId":"19964479","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Supervised adaptive downsampling for P300-based brain computer interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised adaptive downsampling for P300-based brain computer interface","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01530446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050763S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5334058,"authors":[{"name":"Chihwen Cheng","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chihwen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37075392100"},{"name":"Xueliang Huo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xueliang","lastName":"Huo","id":"37586185200"},{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Ghovanloo","id":"37275363200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5334058","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking","Tongue","Medical treatment","Magnetic sensors","Sensor arrays","Sensor systems","Permanent magnets","Motion detection","Mouth","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocommunications","biomagnetism","biomechanics","magnetic moments","neurophysiology","optimisation","permanent magnets","speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic localization","tongue movement","speech-language therapy","optimization","permanent magnet","3-D magneto-inductive sensor array","magnetic dipole equation","Powell algorithm","DIRECT","Nelder-Mead algorithm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Communication Aids for Disabled","Computer-Aided Design","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Humans","Magnetics","Man-Machine Systems","Movement","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Speech Disorders","Telemetry","Tongue","Transducers","User-Computer Interface"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new magnetic localization system based on a compact triangular sensor setup and three different optimization algorithms, intended for tracking tongue motion in the 3-D oral space.

Since most clinical MRI scanners are equipped with multi-channel receiver systems, integrating CS with multi-channel systems may not only shorten the scan time but provide a better image quality. However, significant computation time is required to perform CS reconstruction. Furthermore, this burden will be scaled by the number of channels. In this paper, we proposed a reconstruction procedure, which uses multi-core processors to accelerate CS reconstruction from multiple channel data. The performance was tested in terms of comparing to different image sizes and using different number cores of CPU. Experimentally, it shows that the maximum efficiency benefits from parallelizing the CS reconstructions, pipelining multi-channel data on multi-core processors and choosing the numbers of channels as multiple numbers of cores.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334095","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05334095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","startPage":"2684","endPage":"2687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI with multi-channel data using multi-core processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5334095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI with multi-channel data using multi-core processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334095/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992960","pubMedId":"19964591","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5334095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing MRI with multi-channel data using multi-core processors","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"07081188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042118S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5334126,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Lotte","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory, Institute of Infocomm Research-Agency for Science, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Lotte","id":"37681401500"},{"name":"Cuntai Guan","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Cuntai","lastName":"Guan","id":"37269144300"},{"name":"Kai Keng Ang","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory, Institute of Infocomm Research-Agency for Science, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kai Keng","lastName":"Ang","id":"37392388500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5334126","dbTime":"46 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain computer interfaces","Feature extraction","Electroencephalography","Frequency","Filter bank","Design methodology","Computer interfaces","USA Councils","Portable computers","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","data recording","feature extraction","image classification","image resolution","medical image processing","neurophysiology","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subject-independent brain-computer interface","motor imagery","BCI","data recording","system training","data acquisition","linear classifiers","filter bank","spatial patterns","feature extraction method","multiresolution frequency decomposition"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Databases, Factual","Electroencephalography","Humans","Man-Machine Systems","Motor Activity","Regression Analysis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"A major limitation of current Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on Motor Imagery (MI) is that they are subject-specific BCI, which require data recording and system training for each new user. This process is time consuming and inconvenient, especially for casual users or portable BCI with limited computational resources. In this paper, we explore the design of a Subject-Independent (SI) MI-based BCI, i.e., a BCI that can be used immediately by any new user without training the BCI with the user's data. This is achieved by training the BCI on data acquired from several other subjects. In order to assess the possibility to build such a BCI, we compared several designs based on different features and classifiers, on data from 9 subjects. Our results suggested that linear classifiers were the most appropriate for the design of MI-based SI-BCI. We also proposed a filter bank common spatial patterns feature extraction method based on a multi-resolution frequency decomposition which achieved the highest accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334126","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05334126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","startPage":"4543","endPage":"4546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of designs towards a subject-independent brain-computer interface based on motor imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5334126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of designs towards a subject-independent brain-computer interface based on motor imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334126/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992314","pubMedId":"19964647","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5334126/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of designs towards a subject-independent brain-computer interface based on motor imagery","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"11840301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067443S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5334139,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Li","id":"37536975400"},{"name":"Bao-Liang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bao-Liang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37288124100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5334139","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Frequency","Neuroscience","Psychology","Humans","Computer displays","Emotion recognition","USA Councils","Spatial resolution","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","emotion recognition","medical signal processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion classification","gamma band EEG","emotions classification","happiness classification","sadness classification","facial expressions","frequency band searching","common spatial patterns","linear SVM classifier","support vector machine"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Artificial Intelligence","Biomedical Engineering","Electroencephalography","Emotions","Female","Humans","Linear Models","Male","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photic Stimulation","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we use EEG signals to classify two emotions-happiness and sadness.

Obtained results showed, that the ability of generalization of created system, expressed as a measure of sensitivity and specificity increased, due to extracting and selectively choosing only the most representative features for analyzed AF detection problem. Classification results achieved by means of constructed matched wavelet, created for given AF detection features were better than indicators obtained for standard wavelet basic functions used in ECG time-frequency decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334220","startPage":"4691","endPage":"4694","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05334220.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rules extraction in SVM and neural network classifiers of atrial fibrillation patients with matched wavelets as a feature generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334220/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rules extraction in SVM and neural network classifiers of atrial fibrillation patients with matched wavelets as a feature generator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5334220/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10984222","pubMedId":"19964831","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rules extraction in SVM and neural network classifiers of atrial fibrillation patients with matched wavelets as a feature generator","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"12241910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066366S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5334233,"authors":[{"name":"Sun-Il Chang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sun-Il","lastName":"Chang","id":"37423686700"},{"name":"Euisik Yoon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Euisik","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37275464600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5334233","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"abstract":"We report an energy efficient pseudo open-loop amplifier with programmable band-pass filter developed for neural interface systems.

This high pass filter is typically realized using large area capacitors and teraohm resistances which makes integration difficult. In this paper, we present a novel topology for a neural amplifier which exploits the (1/f)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n power spectra of local field potentials (LFP).

We built an array of neural amplifiers based on this principle and tested it on rats chronically implanted with microelectrode arrays. We found that we could recover the initial LFP signal and the power spectral information over time with correlation coefficient greater than 0.94.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334436","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2053","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05334436.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the 1/f structure of neural signals for the design of integrated neural amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the 1/f structure of neural signals for the design of integrated neural amplifiers","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5334436/","accessionNumber":"10983811","pubMedId":"19964775","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334436/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the 1/f structure of neural signals for the design of integrated neural amplifiers","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"05341277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052894S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5334498,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

It utilizes electrical current to activate nerves innervating extremities affected by paralysis. An effective combination of a traditional PID controller and a neural network, being capable of nonlinear expression and adaptive learning property, supply a more reliable approach to construct FES controller that help the paraplegia complete the action they want. A FES system tuned by radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) model was designed to control the knee joint according to the desired trajectory through stimulation of lower limbs muscles in this paper.

during vigilance states of quiet-waking, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep. A modified Grassberger-Procaccia method was implemented to compute the correlation integral using a Euclidean distance normalized by the embedding dimension. The performance of the correlation dimension as a measure to characterize the sleep EEG was compared to the quantitative measures derived from linear autoregressive models. Even though linear and chaotic measures are based on completely different theories and concepts, our experimental results have indicated them both effective in capturing the characteristic differences of sleep EEG during various states. The preliminary results have also shown the correlation dimension being particularly effective in emphasizing the differences in regard to the chaotic behavior between the EEG activity in SWS and QW and REM sleep.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5334635/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992578","pubMedId":"19964980","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of linear and chaotic measures for rat hippocampal eeg during different vigilance states","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of linear and chaotic measures for rat hippocampal eeg during different vigilance states","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"09012067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051408S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5334659,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Behlouli","affiliation":["Divisions of Internal Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Behlouli","id":"37088170941"},{"name":"Deborah E.

The Minnesota Living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is the instrument most widely used to evaluate QoL in heart failure (HF) patients. It is a questionnaire containing 21 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 105. A best cut-off value for MLHFQ scores to identify those patients with good, moderate or poor QoL has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To determine a cut-off score for the MLHFQ based on the neural network (NN) approach. These cut-off scores will help discriminate between HF patients having good, moderate or poor QoL. METHODS: This research was carried out in the context of a longitudinal cohort study of new patients attending specialized HF clinics in six participating centers in Quebec, Canada. Patients completed a questionnaire that included the MLHFQ. In addition to this scale, self-perceived health status and clinical information related to the severity of HF were obtained including: the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6 minute walk test and survival status. We analyzed the database using NN and conventional statistical tools. The NN is a statistical program that recognizes clusters of MLHFQ and relates similar QoL measures to one another. Among the 531 eligible patients, 447 patients with complete questionnaires were used to build randomly two sets for training (learning set) and for testing (validation set) the NN. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 65 years and 24% were women. The median MLHFQ score was 45 (inter-quartile range: 27 to 64). NN identified 3 distinct clusters of MLHFQ that represent the full spectrum of possible scores on the MLHFQ. We estimated that a score of < 24 on the MLHFQ represents a good QoL, a score between 24 and 45 represents a moderate QoL, and a score > 45 represents a poor QoL. Validation with the different severity measures confirmed these categories. These cut-offs allowed us to reach a good total accuracy (91%). These cutoffs were strongly correlated with survival status (p= 0.004), self-perceived health status (p=0.0032), NYHA functional class (p<0.0001) and standardized 6 minutes walk test (p=0.05) CONCLUSION: The identification of three levels of MLHFQ should be useful in clinical decision making.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334659/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10992381","pubMedId":"19965089","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5334659/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identifying relative cut-off scores with neural networks for interpretation of the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying relative cut-off scores with neural networks for interpretation of the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"16080155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084017S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5334694,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

In this exploratory paper, a CS-based video compression approach suitable for wireless capsule endoscopy is proposed. In general, the amount of video data generated by capsule endoscopy is so large that video compression is the best way to lower the communication bandwidth and save the RF transmitting power. However, due to power limitation and small size conditions, traditional video compression techniques are not appropriate. Applying state-of-the-art CS theory may significantly reduce power consumption and memory of video compressor, thanks to its low computational complexity. The proposed approach is based on YUV color space conversion, blocking, zigzag scan and CS measuring. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed idea and that future improving works are necessary.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334819","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05334819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","startPage":"3727","endPage":"3730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity video compression for capsule endoscope based on compressed sensing theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5334819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity video compression for capsule endoscope based on compressed sensing theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334819/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984239","pubMedId":"19965013","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5334819/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity video compression for capsule endoscope based on compressed sensing theory","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"09731833.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061861S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5334819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5334876,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Hwan Joo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Hwan Joo","id":"37087368719"},{"name":"Dae-Han Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Han Hong","id":"37087360457"},{"name":"Yoon-Gu Kim","affiliation":["Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoon-Gu Kim","id":"37087360674"},{"name":"Ho-Geun Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Geun Lee","id":"37087593901"},{"name":"Ki-Dong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Dong Lee","id":"37087151695"},{"name":"Suk-Gyu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suk-Gyu Lee","id":"37087199041"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5334876","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"abstract":"This paper presents a path planning algorithm for a fast mobile robot based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) by fusing the satellite navigation and the vision system in the outdoor environment.

This research consists of a motion segmentation stage which gets motion information of moving objects form motion model, and a motion estimation stage which estimates the position and the motion of moving object using EKF. EKF based approach is served as the de-facto approach to SLAM with shortcomings of quadratic complexity and sensitivity to failures in data association.

In order to obtain accurate and simple RBF neural networks efficiently, a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) is used to train the neural networks, in which the number of hidden units and the parameters of centers are optimized by the HGA simultaneously. The spread factors and the weights of the neural networks are calculated by the linear algebra methods for relieving computational burden. The proposed algorithm is applied to the modelling of the electrohydraulic system, and the results clearly indicate that the obtained RBF neural network can model the hydraulic system satisfactorily. The comparison results also show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the traditional methods.","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1022","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05334916.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical genetic algorithm based RBF neural network approach for modelling of electrohydraulic system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5334916/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical genetic algorithm based RBF neural network approach for modelling of electrohydraulic system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5334916/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10982722","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical genetic algorithm based RBF neural network approach for modelling of electrohydraulic system","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2A055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085513S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5334916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5334957,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Lenzi","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Lenzi","id":"38559061700"},{"name":"Stefano De Rossi","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"De Rossi","id":"38556477000"},{"name":"Nicola Vitiello","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Vitiello","id":"38506597800"},{"name":"Azzurra Chiri","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Azzurra","lastName":"Chiri","id":"38558415000"},{"name":"Stefano Roccella","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Roccella","id":"38556720800"},{"name":"Francesco Giovacchini","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Giovacchini","id":"38556804200"},{"name":"Fabrizio Vecchi","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Vecchi","id":"37424298600"},{"name":"Maria Chiara Carrozza","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Technology and Systems Laboratory-Scuola Superiore Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria Chiara","lastName":"Carrozza","id":"38556817900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3296-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"5334957","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rehabilitation robotics","Neuroscience","Subspace constraints","Exoskeletons","Human robot interaction","Force measurement","Motion control","Elbow","USA Councils","Anthropomorphism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","dexterous manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuro-robotics paradigm","NEURARM","NEUROExos","HANDEXOS","functional support","personal assistance","neuro-rehabilitation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neuro-robotics","robotic model","upper limb exoskeleton","anthropomorphic robotic arm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Biomedical Engineering","Computers","Cybernetics","Equipment Design","Fingers","Human Engineering","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurosurgery","Neurosurgery","Recovery of Function","Robotics","Software","Surgery, Computer-Assisted","Surgery, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"This work describes the neuro-robotics paradigm: the fusion of neuroscience and robotics.

MD has proved particularly useful in elucidating the functional mechanisms of membrane proteins, whose dynamics are especially difficult to characterize experimentally. Here, we illustrate the utility of state-of-the-art high-performance MD simulations in the study of membrane proteins, using as examples a G-protein-coupled receptor, an aquaporin, and an antiporter. In each case, we used MD either to deduce an atomic-level mechanism for protein function or to reconcile apparent discrepancies among recent experimental observations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307844/5332379/05335057.pdf","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2342","publicationTitle":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5335057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5335057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elucidating membrane protein function through long-timescale molecular dynamics simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomembranes","Proteins","Hardware","Biological system modeling","Bridges","Switches","Software algorithms","USA Councils","Pharmaceuticals","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomembranes","molecular biophysics","molecular dynamics method","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["membrane protein function","long-timescale molecular dynamics simulation","G-protein-coupled receptor","aquaporin","antiporter","atomic-level mechanism"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Aquaporins","Cell Membrane","Computational Biology","Computer Simulation","Computers","Crystallography, X-Ray","Escherichia coli","Membrane Proteins","Models, Molecular","Molecular Dynamics Simulation","Sodium-Hydrogen Antiporter","Software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Elucidating membrane protein function through long-timescale molecular dynamics simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335057/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992801","pubMedId":"19965181","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elucidating membrane protein function through long-timescale molecular dynamics simulation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"06181033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078224S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307844","isNumber":"5332379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307844","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5332379","articleId":"5335057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5335065,"authors":[{"name":"Tod D.

up-link satellite signals are presented for the past four years of 2003-2006 in Japan and Indonesia, using Japan's domestic communication satellite Superbird C that connects Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere of Kyoto University (RISH) to Equatorial Atmosphere Radar Observatory (EAR). Compared with the rainfall rates with the same time percentages, equivalent path lengths of the satellite signal against the rain area are shown to be reduced down to 2 km at EAR, which is remarkably shorter than those at RISH in Japan. The almost same attenuation values and annual statistics are, however, obtained from the X-band radar observations simultaneously conducted at EAR. This suggests that long-term radar observations of convective clouds are effective to estimate rain attenuation statistics of the satellite signals in the tropical regions.","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05335239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of rain attenuation characteristics of satellite communication links using x-band meteorological radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of rain attenuation characteristics of satellite communication links using x-band meteorological radars","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335239/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10982525","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5335239/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of rain attenuation characteristics of satellite communication links using x-band meteorological radars","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2A164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060613S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5335239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5335251,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Yoshida","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37287351300"},{"name":"Kuniaki Tanaka","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Kuniaki Tanaka","id":"37310350200"},{"name":"Kazunori Katayama","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazunori Katayama","id":"37313111600"},{"name":"Takeshi Tsujimura","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Tsujimura","id":"37295265200"},{"name":"Yuji Azuma","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuji Azuma","id":"37302443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-34-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-33-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5335251","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical collimators","Optical fibers","Optical losses","Propagation losses","Laser beams","Fiber lasers","Optical fiber networks","Mirrors","Optical control","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical collimators","optical communication equipment","optical focusing","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collimator focus adjustment","free space optics system","single-mode optical fibers","optomechatronic system","low loss transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optics","single-mode optical fiber","collimator","laser beam control"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method for adjusting a free space optics (FSO) system that links two single-mode optical fibers (SMFs) using collimators.

The input factors are composed of today's closing price, index of the stock market and the amount of tomorrow-intended repurchase. A rule-based data clustering is used to group the repurchase days by selecting two records that are under the same conditions as the day before the next repurchase. A few initial predictions are less accurate than the classic accounting equation because the combinations of training set are very limited. However, after several repurchase days have passed, the ANN-based prediction usually introduces less error based on increasing amount of possible training sets. Therefore, this technique can be very useful if the repurchase is spanned in a quite long period.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305883/5332438/05335327.pdf","startPage":"2573","endPage":"2578","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","publicationTitle":"2009 ICCAS-SICE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting the effect of stock repurchase via an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting the effect of stock repurchase via an artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10983061","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5335327/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting the effect of stock repurchase via an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2D123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073414S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305883","isNumber":"5332438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305883","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5332438","articleId":"5335327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5335393,"authors":[{"name":"W.B.

However, majority of encrypted image transmission schemes do not consider well the effect of bit errors occurring during transmission and this issue is considered a problem that should be handled by an efficient coding scheme. In this paper, a modified wireless image transmission scheme that combines chaotic encryption and turbo coding technique into one processing step is proposed. In the proposed scheme, selective encryption algorithm based on two-dimensional chaotic map is utilized for data security. Furthermore, error correction technique based on turbo coding is employed as channel coding for data communication in order to solve the problem of limited bandwidth and throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high degree of robustness against channel impairments and improve image quality with acceptable data rates.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system security","Error correction","Image communication","Cryptography","Robustness","Chaotic communication","Turbo codes","Wireless networks","Image coding","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","chaotic communication","cryptography","error correction codes","image coding","radio networks","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","turbo codes","visual communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable wireless error correction technique","secure image transmission","image quality","wireless network","chaotic encryption algorithm","light transmission","turbo coding technique","two-dimensional chaotic map","data security","channel coding","data communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction code","Image transmission","DWT","Image encryption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335544","doi":"10.1109/CCST.2009.5335544","displayPublicationTitle":"43rd Annual 2009 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307444/5335506/05335544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2009.5335544","startPage":"184","endPage":"188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335506","publicationTitle":"43rd Annual 2009 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable wireless error correction technique for secure image transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliable wireless error correction technique for secure image transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335544/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335544/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976092","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable wireless error correction technique for secure image transmission","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042623S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307444","isNumber":"5335506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307444","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5335506","articleId":"5335544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5335552,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Towards these requirements, this paper introduces a high-capacity second generation based blind watermarking scheme for protection of intellectual property, which takes the consideration of good image quality. In the proposed scheme, the host image is normalized by fast technique to resist geometric attacks and reduce the computational time. The normalized image is then transformed using parametric bi-orthogonal integer lifting wavelet transform (LWT) to increase security. The high-capacity watermark is embedded carefully into the salient features by utilizing least significant bits (LSBs) method to maximize the robustness and quality.

One approach to easing the verification problem and reducing perceived complexity is to use libraries of reusable functions. These reusable functions, known as intellectual property blocks, are commonly created as netlists or RTL components. Complex systems can be created from IP blocks by using high-level design environments. These tools define the types and semantics of component interfaces which permit systems to be debugged using system-level transaction monitoring. However, the insertion of on-chip monitoring circuitry is a manual process in FPGA design flows. In this paper we present an algorithm which exploits the high-level design environment to permit automatic instrumentation of designs. We demonstrate that the algorithm can harness existing HDL generation techniques and reduce the insertion and configuration effort required of the designer.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335653","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314285/5335650/05335653.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated instrumentation of FPGA-based systems for system-level transaction monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335653/","displayDocTitle":"Automated instrumentation of FPGA-based systems for system-level transaction monitoring","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335653/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976424","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated instrumentation of FPGA-based systems for system-level transaction monitoring","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"5335653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048881S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314285","isNumber":"5335650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314285","xplore-issue":"5335650","articleId":"5335653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5335657,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaldo Azevedo","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Azevedo","id":"37302371600"},{"name":"Ben Juurlink","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Juurlink","id":"37267125200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4467-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5335657","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient software cache implementation for H.264 motion compensation on scratchpad memory based systems. For a wide range of applications - especially multimedia applications, the data set is predictable, making it possible to transfer the necessary data before the computation. Some kernels, however, depend on data that are known just before they are needed, such as the H.264 motion compensation (MC). MC has to stall while the data is transfered from the main memory. To overcome this problem and increase the performance, we analyze the data locality for the MC. Based on this analysis, we propose a 2D Software Cache (2DSC) implementation. The 2DSC exploits the application characteristics to reduce overheads, providing in average 65% improvement over the hand programmed DMAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314285/5335650/05335657.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient software cache for H.264 motion compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Application software","Kernel","Performance analysis","Decoding","Mathematics","Computer science","Paper technology","Data analysis","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","code standards","image coding","motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software cache","H.264 motion compensation","scratchpad memory based system","multimedia application"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient software cache for H.264 motion compensation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335657/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10976428","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient software cache for H.264 motion compensation","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"5335657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08262S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314285","isNumber":"5335650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314285","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5335650","articleId":"5335657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5335660,"authors":[{"name":"Guillermo Pay\u00e1-Vay\u00e1","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Pay\u00e1-Vay\u00e1","id":"38274743700"},{"name":"Javier Mart\u00edn-Langerwerf","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Mart\u00edn-Langerwerf","id":"38275424400"},{"name":"Florian Giesemann","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Giesemann","id":"38273531500"},{"name":"Holger Blume","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Blume","id":"37337766500"},{"name":"Peter Pirsch","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Pirsch","id":"37271384700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4467-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5335660","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","VLIW","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Microelectronics","Registers","Processor scheduling","Hardware","Energy consumption","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","multimedia communication","optimising compilers","parallel architectures","program assemblers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLIW architectures","code selection function","instruction scheduler","basic assembler code block","operand registers","functional units","multimedia tasks","dynamic instructions-per-cycle"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a new mechanism for concurrent use of more functional units, without increasing the control path of a generic VLIW architecture.

Most recent mapping algorithms perform them at design time, an approach known as static mapping. Nonetheless, applications running in MPSoCs may execute a varying number of simultaneous tasks. In some cases, applications may be defined only after system design, enforcing a scenario that requires the use of dynamic task mapping. Static mappings have as main advantage the global view of the system, while dynamic mappings normally provide a local view, which considers only the neighborhood of the mapping task. This work aims to evaluate the pros and cons of static and dynamic mapping solutions. Due to the global system view, it is expected that static mapping algorithms achieve superior performance (w.r.t. latency, congestion, energy consumption). As dynamic scenarios are a trend in present MPSoC designs, the cost of dynamic mapping algorithms must be known, and directions to improve the quality of such algorithms should be provided without increasing execution time. This quantitative comparison between static and dynamic mapping algorithms is the main contribution of this work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335650","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314285/5335650/05335672.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335672","startPage":"087","endPage":"090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of static and dynamic task mapping algorithms in NoC-based MPSoCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335672/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of static and dynamic task mapping algorithms in NoC-based MPSoCs","htmlLink":"/document/5335672/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10976443","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of static and dynamic task mapping algorithms in NoC-based MPSoCs","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"5335672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04021S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314285","isNumber":"5335650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314285","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5335650","articleId":"5335672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5335684,"authors":[{"name":"Kshitij Bhardwaj","affiliation":["DAVV, Institute of Engineering and Technology, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Kshitij","lastName":"Bhardwaj","id":"37396947200"},{"name":"Rabindra K.

It was found that neither approximate entropy (ApEn) nor sample entropy (SampEn) methods was accurate in measuring signals' complexity when the recommended values (e.g., m = 2 and r = 0.1-0.2 times the standard deviation of the signal) were strictly adhered to. However, when we selected the maximum ApEn value as determined by considering many different r values, we were able to correctly discern a signal's complexity for both synthetic and experimental data. However, this requires that many different choices of r values need to be considered. This is a very cumbersome and time-consuming process. Thus, the primary goal of the present work is to illustrate our recently developed method that can automatically select the appropriate tolerance threshold value r, which corresponds to the maximum ApEn value, without resorting to the calculation of ApEn for each of the threshold values selected in the range of zero and one times the standard deviation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/51/5335698/05335714.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MEMB.2009.934629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMB.2009.934629","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate entropy for all signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335714/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate entropy for all signals","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335714/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10968078","pubMedId":"19914883","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"November-December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate entropy for all signals","sourcePdf":"018-23-28memb06-chon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086597S","chronDate":"November-December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"51","isNumber":"5335698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5335698","articleId":"5335714","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5335725,"authors":[{"name":"Yasemin M.

Wind power generation is fluctuating due to the variation of wind. As more and more wind power generation is integrated into the power system, it is very important to predict the wind power production to contribute the system reserve reduction and the operational costs of the power plants. This paper brings wavelet transform into the time series of wind power and verifies that the decomposed series all have chaotic characteristic, so a new method of wind power prediction in short-term with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model based on wavelet transform is presented. To test the approach, the wind power data from the Fujin wind farm and Saihanba wind farm of China are used for this study. The prediction results are presented and compared to the no wavelet transform method and ARMA method. The results show that the new method based on wavelet transform neural networks will be a useful tool in wind power prediction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind power prediction using wavelet transform and chaotic characteristics","publicationTitle":"2009 World Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power and Energy Conference","doi":"10.1109/WNWEC.2009.5335780","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318951/5335749/05335780.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNWEC.2009.5335780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wind power prediction using wavelet transform and chaotic characteristics","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5335780/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975720","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind power prediction using wavelet transform and chaotic characteristics","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"A6WindPowerPredictionUsingWaveletTransforman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063464S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318951","isNumber":"5335749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318951","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5335749","articleId":"5335780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5335794,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Mu","affiliation":["Aero-Power Science-Technology Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Mu","id":"37682851800"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Aero-Power Science-Technology Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677582800"},{"name":"Jie Hu","affiliation":["Aero-Power Science-Technology Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37674505800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4702-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1055"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1063"}],"articleNumber":"5335794","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuit design","Solid state circuits","Circuit breakers","Delay","Power system analysis computing","Circuit noise","Switching circuits","Wind energy","Automatic control","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","fault current limiters","power electronics","power system protection","power system reliability","zero current switching","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC solid-state circuit breaker","nongrid-connected wind power system","flexible direct current transmission technique","automatic control","soft-switching system","current-commutation","overload delay protection","distribution system","fault current limiter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB)","Thyristor","Fault current limiting","Topology structure","Control strategy","Device conduction loss"]}],"abstract":"Existing mechanical circuit breakers can not satisfy the requirements of fast operation in power system due to noise, electric arc and long switching response time. Moreover the non-grid-connected wind power system is based on the flexible direct current transmission (FDCT) technique. It is especially necessary to research the solid-state circuit breakers (SSCB) to realize the rapid and automatic control for the circuit breakers in the system. Meanwhile, the newly-developed solid-state circuit breakers (SSCB) operating at the natural zero-crossing point of AC system is not suitable for a DC system. Based on the characteristics of the DC system, a novel circuit scheme has been proposed in this paper. The new scheme makes full use of ideology of soft-switching and current-commutation forced by resonance. This scheme successfully realizes the soft turn-on and fast turn-off. In this paper, the topology of current limiter is presented and analytical mathematical models are derived through comprehensive analysis. Finally, normal turn-on and turn-off experiments and overload delay protection test were conducted. The results show the reliability of the novel theory and feasibility of proposed topology. The proposed scheme can be applied in the grid-connected and non-grid-connected DC transmission and distribution systems.","publicationTitle":"2009 World Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power and Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318951/5335749/05335794.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of topological structure for DC solid-state circuit breaker","doi":"10.1109/WNWEC.2009.5335794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNWEC.2009.5335794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of topological structure for DC solid-state circuit breaker","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975617","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5335794/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of topological structure for DC solid-state circuit breaker","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"A68AnalysisandDesignofTopologicalStructurefo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054382S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318951","isNumber":"5335749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318951","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5335749","articleId":"5335794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5335875,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Kimball Thurgood","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5335874/5335875/5335875-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brandon Kimball Thurgood (S'03) was born in Hyde Park, UT.

First, the CRFs don't force to adhere to the independence assumption and thus can depend on arbitrary, non-independent features, without accounting for the distribution of those dependencies. Since CRFs models are able to flexibly utilize a wide variety of features, the training data sparse problem can be efficiently resolved. Moreover, the parameter estimation for CRFs is global, which effectively resolve the label bias problem. In this paper, the CRFs with Gaussian prior smoothing is used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Experiments show that the POS tagging error rate is reduced by 55.17% in close test and 43.64% in open test over HMM-based baseline, and synchronously an accuracy of 98.05% in close test and 95.79% in open test are also achieved. These positive results confirm CRFs superior performance.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2009.210","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335880/5335881/05335969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2009.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335881","startPage":"347","endPage":"350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of CRFs in Part-of-Speech Tagging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Application of CRFs in Part-of-Speech Tagging","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5335969/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977611","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5335969/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of CRFs in Part-of-Speech Tagging","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3752b347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048101S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335880","isNumber":"5335881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335880","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5335881","articleId":"5335969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5335996,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-ai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xi-ai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310010700"},{"name":"Ya-ru Cui","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Ya-ru","lastName":"Cui","id":"37306450700"},{"name":"Yi-ping Lu","affiliation":["School of Mechanics & Electronic Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi-ping","lastName":"Lu","id":"37310927900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3752-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5335996","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5335996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent systems","Humans","Machine intelligence","Costs","Learning systems","Collaboration","Design engineering","Man machine systems","Cybernetics","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD/CAM","cost reduction","decision making","human computer interaction","intelligent manufacturing systems","knowledge based systems","labour resources","product design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active knowledge support system","intelligent product design","humachine decision loop","machine-to-human knowledge assistance","inference machine","knowledge storage base","human knowledge-learning","human-in-loop theory ideology","knowledge bang","human knowledge labor cost reduction","humachine collaboration","CAD/CAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active knowledge support","humachine collaboration","intelligent design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2009.185","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335880/5335881/05335996.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2009.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Research of Active Knowledge Support System in Intelligent Design","abstract":"According to the current status of knowledge bang and the analysis of existing methods of knowledge support, purpose an active knowledge support system, and embed it into humachine decision loop in an intelligent design.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be used under these disasters for surveillance, search and rescue. In order to have good performances in mission areas, effective algorithms are required in mission re-tasking and path re-planning to handle unanticipated events or any environmental disturbances. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to deal with path re-planning for multi-mission of multi-UAV under environments with unexpected events. A group of UAVs are considered to perform joint missions. Each UAV plans its own initial, optimal or sub-optimal path using Voronoi graph and Dijkstra algorithm. Our algorithm is then employed to assign a distinct task to each UAV and to re-plan its path based on new multi-mission requirement corresponding to some unexpected events. In addition to a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, the paper has also provided relevant simulation results which have shown that the algorithm can be used effectively for multiple cooperating UAVs' path re-planning under uncertain and dynamic disaster environments.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2009.113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2009.113","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335880/5335901/05336128.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-mission Path Re-planning for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Unexpected Events","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-mission Path Re-planning for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Unexpected Events","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046282","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336128/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-mission Path Re-planning for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Unexpected Events","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3752a423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037352S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335880","isNumber":"5335901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335880","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5335901","articleId":"5336128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336132,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Guo","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Guo","id":"37673706800"},{"name":"Sheng-jing Tang","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng-jing","lastName":"Tang","id":"37667296000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3752-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5336132","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization with Re-initialization Mechanism","abstract":"An improved Particle Swarm Optimization with re-initialization mechanism, which is based on the estimation of the varieties and activities of the particles, is proposed to balance the global search ability of the Standard Swarm Optimization (SPSO).

As the level of the DWT decomposition increases, the number of bits needed to represent the wavelet coefficients also increases. A significant amount of memory is needed to store these wavelet coefficients especially when the level of DWT decomposition is high. In this paper, a post-processing method is proposed to set the amplitude of the wavelet coefficients to pre-defined N-bits. The set-partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) coding is then performed to encode these coefficients to achieve compression. The main advantage of our proposed work is the significant reduction in memory requirements for wavelet coefficients storage during bit-plane coding. Simulation results show that our proposed SPIHT coding using wavelet transform with post-processing gives an equally good compression performance when M-3 les N les M-1 where M and N are the number of bits needed to represent the largest wavelet coefficient without and with post-processing respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2009.101","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335880/5335901/05336139.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2009.101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Memory SPIHT Coding Using Wavelet Transform with Post-Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336139/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Memory SPIHT Coding Using Wavelet Transform with Post-Processing","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977723","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336139/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Memory SPIHT Coding Using Wavelet Transform with Post-Processing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3752a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064097S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335880","isNumber":"5335901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335880","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5335901","articleId":"5336139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5336145,"authors":[{"name":"Liming Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290618600"},{"name":"Junxiu Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Junxiu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405242100"},{"name":"Min Dai","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Dai","id":"37086907434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3752-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5336145","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Chip Fuzzy Control System Based on Mixed-Signal FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335880/5335901/05336145.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2009.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5335901","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2009.107","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Field programmable gate arrays","Control systems","Fuzzy reasoning","Hardware design languages","Educational institutions","Design engineering","Fuzzy systems","Flash memory","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","control system synthesis","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","hardware description languages","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single chip fuzzy control system","mixed-signal FPGA","verilog HDL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Single chip","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Circuit simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336145","abstract":"A fuzzy control system is analyzed and designed basing on a new hardware platform mixed-signal FPGA.

It has been widely adopted in various communication standards such as DVB-S2, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi. However, the irregular message exchange pattern is a major challenge in LDPC decoder implementation In addition, faced with an era that diverse applications are integrated in a single system, a flexible, scalable, efficient and cost-effective implementation of LDPC decoder is highly preferable. In this paper, we proposed a multi-processor platform based on network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect as a solution to these problems. By using a distributed and cooperative way for LDPC decoding, the memory bottleneck commonly seen in LDPC decoder design is eliminated. Simulation results from long LDPC codes with various code rates show good scalability and speedups are obtained by our approach.","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2009.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2009.9","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2009 21st International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 21st International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5336186/5336187/05336214.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel LDPC Decoding on a Network-on-Chip Based Multiprocessor Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336214/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Parallel LDPC Decoding on a Network-on-Chip Based Multiprocessor Platform","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"11046196","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336214/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel LDPC Decoding on a Network-on-Chip Based Multiprocessor Platform","confLoc":"Sao Paolo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3857a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057877S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5336186","isNumber":"5336187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5336186","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5336187","articleId":"5336214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5336215,"authors":[{"name":"Artur L. dos Santos","affiliation":["Computer Science Center, Virtual Reality and Multimedia Research Group, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Artur L.","lastName":"dos Santos","id":"38256419400"},{"name":"Joao Marcelo X.N.

A performance analysis of the implemented techniques demonstrates that two of these algorithms, once adequately adapted to CUDA architecture, are capable of reaching speedup gains up to 15times when compared to former CPU implementations and up to 4times in comparison to existing and optimized parallel ones.

They allow performance levels close to the ones obtained from Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), while still keeping design and implementation flexibility. However, to efficiently program FPGAs, one needs the expertise of hardware developers and to master hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL or Verilog. The attempts to furnish a high-level compilation flow (e.g., from C programs) still have open issues before efficient and consistent results can be obtained. Bearing in mind the FPGA resources, we have developed LALP, a novel language to program FPGAs. A compilation framework including mapping capabilities supports the language. The main ideas behind LALP is to provide a higher abstraction level than HDLs, to exploit the intrinsic parallelism of hardware resources, and to permit the programmer to control execution stages whenever the compiler techniques are unable to generate efficient implementations. In this paper we describe LALP, and show how it can be used to achieve high-performance computing solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046199","htmlLink":"/document/5336218/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LALP: A Novel Language to Program Custom FPGA-Based Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LALP: A Novel Language to Program Custom FPGA-Based Architectures","confLoc":"Sao Paolo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3857a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083704S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5336186","isNumber":"5336187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5336186","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5336187","articleId":"5336218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5336223,"authors":[{"name":"Junho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37290235600"},{"name":"Naresh R.

By applying these techniques, power saving of up to 35% is demonstrated when implemented in a 90 nm CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336223","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319413/5336222/05336223.pdf","startPage":"040","endPage":"045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power implementation of a high-throughput LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11N standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-power implementation of a high-throughput LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11N standard","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336223/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979077","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336223/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power implementation of a high-throughput LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11N standard","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"P08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060236S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319413","isNumber":"5336222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319413","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5336222","articleId":"5336223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5336225,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Brunelli","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Brunelli","id":"37298515300"},{"name":"Heikki Berg","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Heikki","lastName":"Berg","id":"37682073000"},{"name":"David Guevorkian","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Guevorkian","id":"37294855600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4335-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"5336225","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Digital signal processing","Table lookup","Arithmetic","Hardware","Random access memory","Signal processing","Approximation methods","Computational efficiency","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signals","function approximation","polynomial approximation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sine functions","variable precision Taylor polynomials","digital signal processing","computational load","variable precision method","cosine function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sine","Taylor","Approximation","Complexity"]}],"abstract":"Sine is one of the fundamental mathematic functions which are widely used in a number of application fields. In particular, signal processing and telecommunications need to calculate sine and cosine of numerical values for several different purposes. One of the challenges which affected the implementation of sine calculation in digital signal processing (DSP) has been the method used to calculate it by means of rational functions, which would allow the implementation of sine calculation in a digital computer system. One possibility is to exploit the Taylor polynomials, even though their main drawback consists of a relatively high grade (thus computational load) already for relatively low-precision approximations. This paper proposes a variable-precision method that allows approximating sine and cosine functions with Taylor polynomials while significantly reducing the computational load required. Our analysis shows how using our method it is possible to achieve the same accuracy marked by other approximation methods, at a lower computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336225","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319413/5336222/05336225.pdf","startPage":"057","endPage":"062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating sine functions using variable-precision Taylor polynomials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Approximating sine functions using variable-precision Taylor polynomials","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336225/","accessionNumber":"10979079","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating sine functions using variable-precision Taylor polynomials","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"P11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055146S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319413","isNumber":"5336222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319413","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5336222","articleId":"5336225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336227,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Acharyya","affiliation":["Pervasive Systems Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Acharyya","id":"37541105800"},{"name":"Koushik Maharatna","affiliation":["Pervasive Systems Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Koushik","lastName":"Maharatna","id":"37276961600"},{"name":"Bashir M.

With the presented decoding algorithm, the total number of floating number comparisons can be reduced dramatically (range from 81% to 91%) at the cost of negligible hardware overhead.

Register files are known to be power and performance bottlenecks in high performance low power embedded processors. Given the strict power constraints and real-time performance constraints of these applications a comprehensive study of the register file architecture is needed to reach the most optimal architecture. In this paper we perform an in depth analysis on different register file architectures and their configurations for wireless forward error correction algorithms of different wireless standards like 802.11n and 802.16e.

In LDPC decoding, the parity check matrix H needs to be accessed at every node updating process, and the size of H matrix is often larger than that of GPU on-chip memory especially when the code-length is long or the weight is high. In this work, the parity check matrix of cyclic or quasi-cyclic LDPC codes is greatly compressed by exploiting the periodic property of the matrix.

This discreteness of the frequency-domain symbol set in context of FFT is of great interest in this paper. In such a paradigm, unfortunately, sparse data corruption in the time domain sequence leads to catastrophic signal degradation in FFT due to its natural noise spread effect, and little can be mitigated by using error control coding schemes (ECC). Potential causes of sparse errors include time-domain sample loss, impulsive noise, and circuit failure in integrated circuits. In this paper, we first characterize the impact of sparse severe errors in the context of FFT, as opposed to that of commonly considered additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Based on observation of distinct impact, a series of computationally efficient algorithms are proposed for detecting and mitigating such errors in lieu of ECC. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can effectively combat various sparse errors and dramatically improve the performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse severe error removal in OFDM demodulators for erasure channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336281","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319413/5336222/05336281.pdf","startPage":"001","endPage":"006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2009.5336281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse severe error removal in OFDM demodulators for erasure channels","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336281/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979130","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse severe error removal in OFDM demodulators for erasure channels","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068767S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319413","isNumber":"5336222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319413","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5336222","articleId":"5336281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5336286,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv K.

The scheme utilizes two battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in which the generated wind power is used to charge one BESS, while the second BESS is used to discharge constant power into grid. The role of the two BESS interchanges when the discharging BESS reaches specified operating limit. With this scheme in mind and based on given wind speed statistics, charging characteristics of the BESS are studied, and a method to determine the expected charging time of the BESS to reach stipulated battery state of charge is developed. The expected BESS charging time, in turn, dictates the constant power level that can be dispatched to the grid through the discharging BESS. The corresponding discharge time is also determined using the developed method, the accuracy of which is validated experimentally. The proposed design procedure is then used to determine the minimum BESS capacity based on the expected wind power. Statistical likelihood of dispatchable power delivery achievable from the scheme is also obtained.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5336283/05336289.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2025331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2025331","startPage":"916","endPage":"925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Approach to the Design of a Dispatchable Wind Power-Battery Energy Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336289/","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Approach to the Design of a Dispatchable Wind Power-Battery Energy Storage System","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10985626","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Approach to the Design of a Dispatchable Wind Power-Battery Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tec-yao-2025331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06586S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5336283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"87","articleId":"5336289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336295,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander V.

The problem is formulated as a strategic form game where the objective of each player (secondary system) is to maximize its own payoff defined in terms of resource utilizations. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal Nash equilibrium solution are derived for the specified payoff functions. Using tools of the non-cooperative game theory, the Payoff-Enriched Adaptive Learning (PEAL) methodology is proposed to enable each secondary system to iteratively adapt spectrum access strategy in response to the observed interference from other secondary systems. The self-learning adaptations of PEAL require neither signaling nor time synchronization between autonomous secondary systems. It is shown through extensive numerical evaluations that the PEAL adaptations converge to the theoretical Nash equilibrium in a finite numbers of trials.","doi":"10.4108/ICST.BROADNETS2009.7301","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319524/5336330/05336374.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/ICST.BROADNETS2009.7301","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks, and Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-cooperative optimal game-theoretic opportunistic dynamic spectrum access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Non-cooperative optimal game-theoretic opportunistic dynamic spectrum access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336374/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336374/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979163","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-cooperative optimal game-theoretic opportunistic dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"040paper7301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049026S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319524","isNumber":"5336330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319524","xplore-issue":"5336330","articleId":"5336374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5336429,"authors":[{"name":"Rylan Cottrell","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Rylan","lastName":"Cottrell","id":"37683993300"},{"name":"Brina Goyette","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Brina","lastName":"Goyette","id":"37409276100"},{"name":"Reid Holmes","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Reid","lastName":"Holmes","id":"37311968500"},{"name":"Robert J.

While several approaches exist to assist developers in locating source code examples, they often present their results only in a basic list view, with at most an indication of the relationship to the search query; unfortunately, they offer no information on how the results relate to one another. A developer is then faced with the highly manual task of exploring these examples to discern their similarities and differences. This paper describes our prototype tool (called Guido) for exploring source code examples, using their structural correspondences. The Guido tool uses multiple coordinated views to visualize the relationships between examples, in order to assist the developer in identifying common and unique traits between them.","doi":"10.1109/VISSOF.2009.5336429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISSOF.2009.5336429","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314286/5336412/05336429.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compare and contrast: Visual exploration of source code examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compare and contrast: Visual exploration of source code examples","conferenceDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336429/","accessionNumber":"11046369","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336429/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compare and contrast: Visual exploration of source code examples","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"120Ds1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052001S","chronDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314286","isNumber":"5336412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314286","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5336412","articleId":"5336429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5336431,"authors":[{"name":"Mariam Sensalire","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and IT, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"],"firstName":"Mariam","lastName":"Sensalire","id":"37670121900"},{"name":"Patrick Ogao","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and IT, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Ogao","id":"37670122800"},{"name":"Alexandru Telea","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Computing Science, University of Groningam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Telea","id":"37268047100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5027-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5026-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5336431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":572},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software tools","Visualization","Computer graphics","Mathematics","Programming","Guidelines","Performance evaluation","Animation","Cinematography","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","DP industry","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software visualization tools","software development companies","SoftVis tools"]}],"abstract":"Many software visualization (SoftVis) tools are continuously being developed by both researchers as well as software development companies. In order to determine if the developed tools are effective in helping their target users, it is desirable that they are exposed to a proper evaluation. Despite this, there is still lack of a general guideline on how these evaluations should be carried out and many of the tool developers perform very limited or no evaluation of their tools. Each person that carries out one evaluation, however, has experiences which, if shared, can guide future evaluators. This paper presents the lessons learned from evaluating over 20 SoftVis tools with over 90 users in five different studies spread on a period of over two years. The lessons covered include the selection of the tools, tasks, as well as evaluation participants. Other discussed points are related to the duration of the evaluation experiment, its location, the procedure followed when carrying out the experiment, as well as motivation of the participants. Finally, an analysis of the lessons learned is shown with the hope that these lessons will be of some assistance to future SoftVis tool evaluators.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISSOF.2009.5336431","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5314286/5336412/05336431.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"26","doi":"10.1109/VISSOF.2009.5336431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of software visualization tools: Lessons learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of software visualization tools: Lessons learned","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336431/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046371","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336431/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of software visualization tools: Lessons learned","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"115Cf3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099565S","chronDate":"25-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5314286","isNumber":"5336412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5314286","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5336412","articleId":"5336431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5336491,"authors":[{"name":"Hideaki Uchiyama","affiliation":["Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideaki","lastName":"Uchiyama","id":"37596097700"},{"name":"Hideo Saito","affiliation":["Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Saito","id":"37273875600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5390-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5389-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5336491","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Augmented reality","Nearest neighbor searches","Cameras","Image databases","Pattern matching","Robustness","Multimedia systems","Virtual reality","Image processing","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text document augmentation","online learning","locally likely arrangement hashing","pose estimation","paper-based augmented reality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LLAH","on-line learning","pose estimation","paper registration","paper based augmented reality"]}],"abstract":"We propose a technique for text document tracking over a large range of viewpoints. Since the popular SIFT or SURF descriptors typically fail on such documents, our method considers instead local arrangement of keypoints. We extends locally likely arrangement hashing (LLAH), which is limited to fronto-parallel images: We handle a large range of viewpoints by learning the behavior of keypoint patterns when the camera viewpoint changes. Our method starts tracking a document from a nearly frontal view. Then, it undergoes motion, and new configurations of keypoints appear. The database is incrementally updated to reflect these new observations, allowing the system to detect the document under the new viewpoint. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method by comparing it with the original LLAH.","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336491","publicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319342/5336438/05336491.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmenting text document by on-line learning of local arrangement of keypoints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336491/","displayDocTitle":"Augmenting text document by on-line learning of local arrangement of keypoints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979039","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336491/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmenting text document by on-line learning of local arrangement of keypoints","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"095098uchiyama.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041854S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319342","isNumber":"5336438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319342","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5336438","articleId":"5336491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5336503,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Lincoln","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lincoln","id":"37681875000"},{"name":"Greg Welch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Welch","id":"37300645000"},{"name":"Andrew Nashel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Nashel","id":"37321435400"},{"name":"Adrian Ilie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Ilie","id":"37566021800"},{"name":"Andrei State","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"State","id":"37565489200"},{"name":"Henry Fuchs","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Fuchs","id":"37285537200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5390-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5389-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5336503","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":703},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336503","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Animation","Lamps","Avatars","Humans","Displays","Robot sensing systems","Head","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avatars","computer vision","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["animatronic shader lamps avatars","articulated robots","robotic avatars","humanoid animatronic model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.4.3 [Information Systems Applications]: Communications Applications","Computer conferencing, teleconferencing, and videoconferencing H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Animations","Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three Dimensional Graphics and Realism","Virtual Reality; I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications"]}],"abstract":"Applications such as telepresence and training involve the display of real or synthetic humans to multiple viewers. When attempting to render the humans with conventional displays, non-verbal cues such as head pose, gaze direction, body posture, and facial expression are difficult to convey correctly to all viewers. In addition, a framed image of a human conveys only a limited physical sense of presence - primarily through the display's location. While progress continues on articulated robots that mimic humans, the focus has been on the motion and behavior of the robots. We introduce a new approach for robotic avatars of real people: the use of cameras and projectors to capture and map the dynamic motion and appearance of a real person onto a humanoid animatronic model. We call these devices Animatronic Shader Lamps Avatars (SLA).We present a proof-of-concept prototype comprised of a camera, a tracking system, a digital projector, and a life-sized styrofoam head mounted on a pan-tilt unit. The system captures imagery of a moving, talking user and maps the appearance and motion onto the animatronic SLA, delivering a dynamic, real-time representation of the user to multiple viewers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336503","publicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319342/5336438/05336503.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"33","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Animatronic Shader Lamps Avatars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Animatronic Shader Lamps Avatars","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979049","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Animatronic Shader Lamps Avatars","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"027033lincoln.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060375S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319342","isNumber":"5336438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319342","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5336438","articleId":"5336503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5336537,"authors":[{"name":"Mladen Bozanic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Bozanic","id":"37085934562"},{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"},{"name":"Monuko du Plessis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Monuko","lastName":"du Plessis","id":"37312601500"},{"name":"Alexandru Muller","affiliation":["IMT Bucharest, National Institute for R and D in Microtechnologies, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Muller","id":"37274073500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4413-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-827X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-0678"}],"articleNumber":"5336537","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","Inductors","Impedance","Spirals","Q factor","Frequency","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","circuit analysis computing","Ge-Si alloys","impedance matching","integrated circuit design","Q-factor","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS-based power amplifier design","streamlined design flow","integrated power amplifier","software routine operation","passive component values","Class-E based power amplifier","Class-F based power amplifier","matching network","standard impedance load","spiral inductor search algorithm","Q-factors","Austria microsystems","single-supply process","frequency 2.4 GHz","size 0.35 mum","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BiCMOS process","spiral inductor","Class-E amplifier","Class-F amplifier","impedance matching","SPICE netlist"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336537","doi":"10.1109/SMICND.2009.5336537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMICND.2009.5336537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336525","publicationTitle":"2009 International Semiconductor Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Semiconductor Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319023/5336525/05336537.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design flow for a SiGe BiCMOS based power amplifier","abstract":"This paper presents a streamlined design flow for an integrated power amplifier.

When orthogonal codes (OCs) are used for channelization in uplink-synchronized CDMA systems, a finite set of OCs tends to severely limit the capacity gain of the uplink-synchronized CDMA systems. The OCHMA system allows each user to use a different OC for each symbol according to an allocated hopping pattern (HP). It also allows multiple users to use the same OC at a specific symbol time, which is called an HP collision. Thus, the proposed OCHMA scheme can accommodate more users than the number of available OCs. We analyze the capacity of the OCHMA scheme and compare the performance of the OCHMA with that of conventional schemes including the system using multi-scrambling codes (MSC) which have also been proposed to overcome a code-limited situation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink capacity improvement through orthogonal code hopping in uplink-synchronized CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336761.pdf","startPage":"5404","endPage":"5410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","displayDocTitle":"Uplink capacity improvement through orthogonal code hopping in uplink-synchronized CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336761/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink capacity improvement through orthogonal code hopping in uplink-synchronized CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"5404-tw0911-jung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05913S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5336764,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Shahan Behbahani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza Shahan","lastName":"Behbahani","id":"37268657000"},{"name":"A.

While fixed and mobile relays can cooperate to improve reception at the desired destination, they also contribute to unintended interference for neighboring cells reusing the same frequency. In this paper, we propose and analyze a relay scheme to simultaneously maximize SNR and minimize MSE, for an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network operating under a receive power constraint guaranteeing that the received signal power is bounded to control interference to neighboring cells. If the intended destination lies at the periphery of the cell, then the proposed scheme guarantees that the total power leaking into neighboring cells is bounded. The optimal relay factors are provided for both correlated and uncorrelated noise at the relays. Simulation results are presented to verify the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

In the IEEE 802.16e system, when a base station (BS) broadcasts a MAP message, which is a control message about scheduling information, it applies a robust modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level and allocates a large amount of radio resources, which induce a huge MAP overhead. Our proposed scheme utilizes piggybacked MAP IEs, in which control messages are concatenated with data packets and transmitted with the MCS level applied to data transmission. Due to the fact that the rate at which data is transmitted is generally higher than the rate at which broadcasting messages are transmitted, the proposed scheme can increase average data rate of a MAP transmission and consequently reduce the amount of resources allocated to the MAP transmission. Numerical analysis and simulations are presented to show that the MAP overhead is critical to system performance and can be improved by the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336766.pdf","startPage":"5431","endPage":"5435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.090025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.090025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous transmission of MAP IE and data for minimizing MAC overhead in the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Media Access Protocol","Base stations","Radio broadcasting","Radio control","Control systems","Robust control","Modulation coding","Concatenated codes","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAP IE","MAC overhead","IEEE 802.16e OFDMA systems","MAP transmission scheme","media access control overhead","MAP message","modulation-and-coding scheme","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.16e, MAC overhead, MAP IE, piggyback."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous transmission of MAP IE and data for minimizing MAC overhead in the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA systems","volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336766/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985651","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous transmission of MAP IE and data for minimizing MAC overhead in the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA systems","sourcePdf":"5431-tw0911-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047864S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5336768,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Hsien Liu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Hsien","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280957400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5336768","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":957},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"We study the implementation algorithm for the MMSE-SIC detection with optimal detection order in a VBLAST system.

The number of real-valued multiplications required by this fast algorithm is approximately 1.57 times that required by the complex-valued LDBABS algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336768.pdf","startPage":"5443","endPage":"5448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.090196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.090196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some results for the fast MMSE-SIC detection in spatially multiplexed MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Fading","Interference cancellation","Silicon carbide","Transmitting antennas","Councils","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiplexing","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast MMSE-SIC detection","spatially multiplexed MIMO systems","VBLAST system","LDLH decomposition","backward substitution","Rayleigh fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BLAST architecture, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system, minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detection, successive interference cancellation (SIC), spatially multiplexed MIMO system."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Some results for the fast MMSE-SIC detection in spatially multiplexed MIMO systems","volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336768/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985653","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some results for the fast MMSE-SIC detection in spatially multiplexed MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"5443-tw0911-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093664S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336771,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"},{"name":"Lorenzo Taponecco","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Taponecco","id":"37270824400"},{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5336771","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Multiple access interference","Peak to average power ratio","Frequency domain analysis","Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Hadamard codes","interference suppression","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference-free code design","MC-CDMA uplink transmissions","multiple access interference","quasisynchronous multicarrier code-division multiple-access network","multipath distortions","carrier frequency offsets","exponential orthogonal codes","Walsh-Hadamard code","MAI suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MCCDMA), interference mitigation, single-user detection, peak-to-average power ratio reduction."]}],"abstract":"In a recent study, solutions have been proposed for completely suppressing the multiple access interference (MAI) arising in the uplink of a quasi-synchronous multicarrier code-division multiple-access network as a consequence of multipath distortions and carrier frequency offsets.

Here, we define a relevant utility function for each connection, which is its radio resource function weighted by a QoS requirement deviation function and a fairness compensation function. We also propose cellular neural networks (CNN) to design the utility-based radio resource scheduler according to the Lyapunov method to solve the constrained optimization problem. The CNN is powerful for complicated optimization problems and has been proved that it can rapidly converge to a desired equilibrium; the utility-based scheduling algorithm can efficiently utilize the radio resource for system, keep the QoS requirements of connections guaranteed, and provide the weighted fairness for connections. Therefore, the CNNU-based scheduler, which determines a radio resource assignment vector for all connections by maximizing an overall system utility, can achieve high system throughput and keep the performance measures of all connections to meet their QoS requirements. Simulation results show that the CNNU-based scheduler attains the average system throughput greater than the EXP and the HOLPRO scheduling schemes by an amount of 23% and 33%, respectively, in the QoS guaranteed region.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336778.pdf","startPage":"5508","endPage":"5519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cellular neural network and utility-based radio resource scheduler for multimedia CDMA communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","displayDocTitle":"A cellular neural network and utility-based radio resource scheduler for multimedia CDMA communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336778/","accessionNumber":"10985663","volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cellular neural network and utility-based radio resource scheduler for multimedia CDMA communication systems","sourcePdf":"5508-tw0911-shen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119494S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5336784,"authors":[{"name":"Shunqing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5336754/5336784/5336784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shunqing Zhang obtained B.S.

One core component behind dynamic spectrum access is the sensing of primary user activity in the shared spectrum. Conventional distributed sensing and centralized decision framework involving multiple sensor nodes is proposed to enhance the sensing performance. However, it is difficult to apply the conventional schemes in reality since the overhead in sensing measurement and sensing reporting as well as in sensing report combining limit the number of sensor nodes that can participate in distributive sensing. In this paper, we shall propose a novel, low overhead and low complexity energy detection based cooperative sensing framework for the cognitive radio systems which addresses the above two issues. The energy detection based cooperative sensing scheme greatly reduces the quiet period overhead (for sensing measurement) as well as sensing reporting overhead of the secondary systems and the power scheduling algorithm dynamically allocate the transmission power of the cooperative sensor nodes based on the channel statistics of the links to the BS as well as the quality of the sensing measurement. In order to obtain design insights, we also derive the asymptotic sensing performance of the proposed cooperative sensing framework based on the mobility model. We show that the false alarm and mis-detection performance of the proposed cooperative sensing framework improve as we increase the number of cooperative sensor nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985669","htmlLink":"/document/5336784/","displayDocTitle":"A low-overhead energy detection based cooperative sensing protocol for cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-overhead energy detection based cooperative sensing protocol for cognitive radio systems","sourcePdf":"5575-tw0911-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050321S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5336785,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5336754/5336785/5336785-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Wen Chang received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

To achieve this goal, we integrate the power control (PC) mechanism and the interference avoidance code assignment strategy. This joint policy is to firstly eliminate interference via an interference avoidance (IA) code assignment strategy and then maintain the QoS via a power control mechanism. To facilitate the code assignment strategy, a new PC-based multiple access interference (MAI) coefficient is defined through performance analysis. Thanks to the help of the PC-based MAI coefficient, we can evaluate each candidate code by quantitatively predicting the amount of interference produced by a possible code assignment event. With this interference pre-evaluation, the PC mechanism can not only maintain the QoS with less transmission power but also eliminate extra MAI in the system. The simulation results show that the proposed joint scheme can maintain a predefined signal quality and significantly improve the call admission rate while largely reducing the power consumption. The contribution of this paper fills up the missing link between the power control and code assignment in the 2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","startPage":"5582","endPage":"5591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint power control and interference avoidance code assignment strategy for downlink MC-DS-CDMA with 2D spreading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A joint power control and interference avoidance code assignment strategy for downlink MC-DS-CDMA with 2D spreading","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10993005","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint power control and interference avoidance code assignment strategy for downlink MC-DS-CDMA with 2D spreading","sourcePdf":"5582-tw0911-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086832S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5336754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5336754","articleId":"5336785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336786,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Bonello","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Nicholas Bonello received the B.Eng.(Hons) degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Malta in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in Radio Frequency Communications Systems from University of Southampton, U.K., in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in Wireless Communications from the University of Southampton, U.K, in 2009.

The proposed robust CSF filtering scheme exploits imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and takes into account the reliability of the CSIT via a Bayesian model. To further improve robustness, we combine CSF filtering with orthogonal space-time block coding in the frequency domain and refer to the resulting scheme as SFC-CSF filtering. We also propose a linear prediction method for improving the quality of the CSIT via post-processing. Based on an upper bound on the worst-case pairwise error probability we formulate an optimization problem for the robust CSF filters which can be solved exactly for certain special cases. For the general case, we obtain an approximate solution by solving a related problem with additional constraints. This approximate solution can be further improved with a gradient algorithm for the original problem. Simulation results confirm the excellent performance of BICM-OFDM with robust CSF and SFC-CSF filtering and the effectiveness of the proposed CSIT post-processing method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5336754/05336794.pdf","startPage":"5671","endPage":"5681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.090259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.090259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transmit Processing for BICM-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Information filtering","Information filters","Channel state information","Transmitters","Bayesian methods","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","filtering theory","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust transmit processing","robust cyclic space-frequency filtering","bit-interleaved coded modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","channel state information","Bayesian model","orthogonal space-time block coding","worst-case pairwise error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BICM-OFDM, space-frequency coding (SFC), cyclic space-frequency (CSF) filtering, channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT).

In order to achieve this goal, we start with algorithmic optimization and propose a novel decomposition of the filter kernels for the deblocking filter. The proposed decomposition reduces the number of adders by 51% and thereby greatly reduces the area requirement for its implementation. Subsequently, at architecture level, while using two identical filtering units, the transpose units are realized by efficient reuse of hardware resources to further reduce the area requirement. The two filtering units process the horizontal and vertical edges of the macro-block simultaneously and therefore further enhance the throughput of the hardware accelerator. Several other optimization techniques, such as reuse of intermediate results, pipelining, and merging of processing blocks on critical path, result in a hardware accelerator for deblocking filter with high throughput at one hand and less area in terms of equivalent gates count on the other, when compared with existing state-of-the-art hardware accelerators in the literature. While working at clock frequency of 166 MHz, synthesized under 0.18 \u00bfm CMOS standard cell technology, it easily meets the throughput requirements of all the levels in H.264/AVC video coding standard and consumes only 12.06 K gates (excluding SRAM).","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM/IFIP 7th Workshop on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM/IFIP 7th Workshop on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/5308789/5336798/05336814.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-throughput, area-efficient hardware accelerator for adaptive deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","doi":"10.1109/ESTMED.2009.5336814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTMED.2009.5336814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A high-throughput, area-efficient hardware accelerator for adaptive deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336814/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-throughput, area-efficient hardware accelerator for adaptive deblocking filter in H.264/AVC","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10235S","chronDate":"15-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5308789","isNumber":"5336798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5308789","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5336798","articleId":"5336814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5336828,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang Haid","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Haid","id":"37670163300"},{"name":"Lars Schor","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Schor","id":"37670161100"},{"name":"Kai Huang","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402214700"},{"name":"Iuliana Bacivarov","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Iuliana","lastName":"Bacivarov","id":"37430158200"},{"name":"Lothar Thiele","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lothar","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37274921100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5169-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5170-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"5336828","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"As single-processor systems are ceasing to scale effectively, multi-processor systems are becoming more and more popular.

This method is based on studying the variations of the channel quality around its expected value when observed during the transmission of a finite-length codeword. We model these variations with a single parameter. This parameter is then viewed as a random variable and its probability distribution function is obtained. Assuming that a decoding failure is the result of an observed channel worse than the codeiquests decoding threshold, the block error probability of finite-length LDPC codes under different decoding algorithms is estimated. Using an extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, the bit error probability is obtained from the block error probability. Different parameters can be used for modeling the channel variations. In this work, two of such parameters are studied.

We describe the design of a parallel-serial decoder architecture that can be used to map any LDPC code with such a structure to a hardware emulation platform. High-throughput emulation allows for the exploration of the low bit-error rate (BER) region and provides statistics of the error traces, which illuminate the causes of the error floors of the (2048, 1723) Reed-Solomon based LDPC (RS-LDPC) code and the (2209, 1978) array-based LDPC code. Two classes of error events are observed: oscillatory behavior and convergence to a class of non-codewords, termed absorbing sets. The influence of absorbing sets can be exacerbated by message quantization and decoder implementation. In particular, quantization and the log-tanh function approximation in sum-product decoders strongly affect which absorbing sets dominate in the errorfloor region. We show that conventional sum-product decoder implementations of the (2209, 1978) array-based LDPC code allow low-weight absorbing sets to have a strong effect, and, as a result, elevate the error floor. Dually-quantized sum-product decoders and approximate sum-product decoders alleviate the effects of low-weight absorbing sets, thereby lowering the error floor.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080105","startPage":"3258","endPage":"3268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336848.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of LDPC decoders for improved low error rate performance: quantization and algorithm choices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of LDPC decoders for improved low error rate performance: quantization and algorithm choices","volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985704","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336848/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of LDPC decoders for improved low error rate performance: quantization and algorithm choices","sourcePdf":"3258-tc0911-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088602S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336849,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Cheng","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering SITE, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336849/5336849-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhong Cheng obtained the B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Southeast University, China in 1993, and the M.A.Sc in Electrical Engineering from University of Ottawa, Canada in 2006.

It is assumed in the literature that the power of the additive noise is known and the expected value of the fading gain is used in a linear function of the channel output to find approximate LLRs. This approach, however, is not optimal in the sense of bit error rate performance. In this paper, we introduce a measure of accuracy for the approximate LLRs based on their probability density function and we show that this measure provides a very convenient tool for finding good approximate LLRs. Assuming that the power of the additive noise is known, and using the proposed measure, we find a linear LLR approximation whose performance is extremely close to that of the true LLR calculation on an uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. These results are then extended to the case that the noise power is also unknown and a performance almost identical to the previous case is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080038","startPage":"3278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080038","endPage":"3287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear LLR approximation for iterative decoding on wireless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336850/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Linear LLR approximation for iterative decoding on wireless channels","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336850/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10985710","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear LLR approximation for iterative decoding on wireless channels","sourcePdf":"3278-tc0911-yazdani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06495S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336851,"authors":[{"name":"Hrishikesh Tapse","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336851/5336851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hrishikesh Tapse was born in 1981 and received his B.E. degree from Osmania University, Hyderabad, India, in 2003.

The QR decomposition of the channel matrix is employed to arrive at an equivalent channel where successive interference cancellation at the transmitter can be used to remove the effect of the multiuser interference. However, in the case of imperfect channel estimation, it is not possible to remove the effect of the multiuser interference due to a mismatch between the precoder and the channel. Consequently, it is necessary to include the estimation error in deriving the probability of symbol error.

The proposed analysis is applicable to BICM systems impaired by general types of fading (including Rayleigh, Ricean, Nakagami-m, Nakagami-q, and Weibull fading) and general types of noise and interference with finite moments such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), additive correlated Gaussian noise, Gaussian mixture noise, co-channel interference, narrowband interference, and ultra-wideband interference. We present an approximate upper bound for the bit error rate (BER) and an accurate closed-form approximation for the asymptotic BER at high signal-to-noise ratios for Viterbi decoding with the standard Euclidean distance branch metric. For the standard rate-1/2 convolutional code the proposed approximate upper bound and the asymptotic approximation become tight at BERs of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n and 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n, respectively. However, if the code is punctured to higher rates (e.g. 2/3 or 3/4), the asymptotic approximation also becomes tight at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n. Exploiting the asymptotic BER approximation we show that the diversity gain of BICM systems only depends on the free distance of the code, the type of fading, and the number of receive antennas but not on the type of noise. In contrast their coding gain strongly depends on the noise moments. Our asymptotic analysis shows that as long as the standard Euclidean distance branch metric is used for Viterbi decoding, BICM systems optimized for AWGN are also optimum for any other type of noise and interference with finite moments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of BICM-SC and BICM-OFDM systems with diversity reception in non-gaussian noise and interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336854.pdf","startPage":"3316","endPage":"3327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of BICM-SC and BICM-OFDM systems with diversity reception in non-gaussian noise and interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336854/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985714","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of BICM-SC and BICM-OFDM systems with diversity reception in non-gaussian noise and interference","sourcePdf":"3316-tc0911-nasri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127298S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5336856,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336856/5336856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Shen (S'0l) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

The single-layer transmission (SLT) and multi-layer transmission (MLT) schemes do not require any knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, but their performance is also limited. It is shown that using Hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) can significantly improve the average rate performance, provided that the rate assignment between different ARQ rounds is carefully chosen. The average rate performance of several HARQ schemes is optimized and compared. In addition, optimal power allocation among retransmissions is derived and shown to further increase the average rate. This power allocation gain is remarkable at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but becomes negligible at high SNR. Comparison of two different types of limited feedback, sequential feedback (ARQ) and one-shot feedback (quantized CSI), is made from several perspectives. Although the optimization problem is formed with respect to the average rate, simulation results give a comprehensive comparison under different metrics, including average rate, outage probability, and the combination of both. Substantial performance improvement is observed with even one ARQ retransmission in all simulations. More importantly, this gain appears to be robust with respect to the fading distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336856.pdf","startPage":"3339","endPage":"3352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the average rate performance of hybrid-ARQ in quasi-static fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the average rate performance of hybrid-ARQ in quasi-static fading channels","volume":"57","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336856/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985716","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336856/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the average rate performance of hybrid-ARQ in quasi-static fading channels","sourcePdf":"3339-tc0911-shen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146317S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336858,"authors":[{"name":"Kishor Barman","affiliation":["School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336858/5336858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kishor Barman is a graduate student in School of Technology and Computer Science at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research since August 2006.

We quantify the capacity/outage capacity improvement due to asynchronism and the corresponding spectral leakage (if any) for MIMO point-to-point and MIMO broadcast channels. We show that under commonly used transmitter spectral mask constraints, the channel has unbounded degrees of freedom. Synchronous PAM exploits only a finite number of these degrees of freedom, and asynchronism helps to improve capacity. For most cases of interest, two distinct shifts attain most of the capacity improvement. These gains are robust to interference from adjacent carriers. Analysis of the spectrum of the asynchronous PAM suggests that optimal water-filling based schemes are useful for improving capacity only in directional links due to possible spectral leakage, while uniform power allocation leads to capacity improvement without any extra spectral leakage.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","startPage":"3366","endPage":"3375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MIMO systems with asynchronous PAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MIMO systems with asynchronous PAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985695","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336858/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MIMO systems with asynchronous PAM","sourcePdf":"3366-tc0911-barman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09348S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336859,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To solve this problem, this paper presents a low-complexity generalized sphere decoding (GSD) approach by transforming the original underdetermined problem into the full-column-rank one so that standard SD can be directly applied on the transformed problem. Since the introduced transformation maintains the dimension of the original problem for all M-QAM's, the proposed GSD approach provides significant reduction in complexity as compared to other GSD schemes, especially for M-QAM with large signaling constellation. Both performance and expected complexity are analyzed to provide the comprehensive relationships between the performance and complexity of the proposed GSD and its parameters. Illustrative simulation and analytical results are in good agreement in terms of both the performance and complexity and indicate that with the properly selected design parameters, the proposed GSD scheme can approach the optimum maximumlikelihood decoding (MLD) performance with low complexity for underdetermined linear communication systems including underdetermined MIMO systems, and the proposed expected complexity analysis can be used as reliable complexity estimation for practical implementation of the proposed algorithm and serve as reference for other GSD algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.060557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336859.pdf","startPage":"3376","endPage":"3388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.060557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity generalized sphere decoding approach for underdetermined linear communication systems: performance and complexity evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336859/","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity generalized sphere decoding approach for underdetermined linear communication systems: performance and complexity evaluation","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985696","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336859/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity generalized sphere decoding approach for underdetermined linear communication systems: performance and complexity evaluation","sourcePdf":"3376-tc0911-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089298S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336860,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A suboptimal water-filling (WF) channel allocation algorithm was previously proposed for the reverse link of this system. To overcome the limitations of the WF algorithm in the presence of fading-induced near-far problem, a new allocation algorithm is proposed and demonstrated to improve performance when the conventional matched filter (MF) receiver is employed. Moreover, the allocation methods are extended to accommodate multiuser detectors (MUDs) at the receiver for MC-CDMA system with AFH. It is demonstrated that the combination of the improved allocation algorithm and the linear MUDs is very efficient in mitigating the fading and multi-access interference (MAI) for realistic mobile radio channels with correlated subcarriers, channel state information (CSI) mismatch, and imperfect power control. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive transmission method has much greater system capacity than conventional non-adaptive MC direct-sequence (DS)-CDMA system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336860.pdf","startPage":"3389","endPage":"3396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.070575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.070575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved channel allocation for multicarrier CDMA with adaptive frequency hopping and multiuser detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Multiaccess communication","Radio spectrum management","Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Adaptive systems","Frequency","Matched filters","Detectors","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","frequency hop communication","matched filters","mobile radio","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier CDMA","adaptive frequency hopping","multiuser detection","multicarrier code-division multiple access","suboptimal water-filling channel allocation algorithm","fading-induced near-far problem","matched filter receiver","multi-access interference","mobile radio channels","channel state information mismatch","imperfect power control","adaptive transmission method","direct-sequence MC-CDMA system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code division multiple access, multiuser channels, fading channels, frequency hop communication, resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved channel allocation for multicarrier CDMA with adaptive frequency hopping and multiuser detection","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336860/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985697","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved channel allocation for multicarrier CDMA with adaptive frequency hopping and multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"3389-tc0911-jia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115503S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5336862,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Meshkati","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336862/5336862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhad Meshkati (S'98, M'06) received the B.A.Sc.

In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its transmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The user's QoS constraints are specified in terms of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average delay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays. The utility function considered here measures energy efficiency and is particularly suitable for wireless networks with energy constraints. The Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form expression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown that the QoS requirements of a user translate into a \"size\" for the user which is an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using this competitive multiuser framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay, network capacity and energy efficiency are studied. In addition, analytical expressions are given for users' delay profiles and the delay performance of the users at Nash equilibrium is quantified.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.050638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336862.pdf","startPage":"3406","endPage":"3414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.050638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336862/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service constraints","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985705","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336862/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service constraints","sourcePdf":"3406-tc0911-meshkati.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066869S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336863,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Bayaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5336830/5336863/5336863-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Bayaki (S'07) was born in Mashhad, Iran in 1979.

In recent years, Gamma-Gamma fading has become the dominant fading model for FSO links because of its excellent agreement with measurement data for a wide range of turbulence conditions. However, in contrast to RF communications, the analysis techniques for FSO are not well developed and prior work has mostly resorted to simulations and numerical integration for performance evaluation in Gamma-Gamma fading. In this paper, we express the pairwise error probabilities of single-input single- output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) as generalized infinite power series with respect to the signal- to-noise ratio. For numerical evaluation these power series are truncated to a finite number of terms and an upper bound for the associated approximation error is provided. The resulting finite power series enables fast and accurate numerical evaluation of the bit error rate of IM/DD FSO with on-off keying and pulse position modulation in SISO and MIMO Gamma-Gamma fading channels. Furthermore, we extend the well-known RF concepts of diversity and combining gain to FSO and Gamma-Gamma fading. In particular, we provide simple closed-form expressions for the diversity gain and the combining gain of MIMO FSO with repetition coding across lasers at the transmitter and equal gain combining or maximal ratio combining at the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10985706","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5336863/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO free-space optical systems in gamma-gamma fading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MIMO free-space optical systems in gamma-gamma fading","sourcePdf":"3415-tc0911-bayaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172078S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5336864,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob C.

The turbulence of the atmosphere causes scintillation of the received signal intensity which is treated as a lognormal random process. The received background radiation and electronic noise in the receiver is treated as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A Chernoff bound is derived for the lognormal sum distribution. An approximation for the lognormal sum distribution is investigated for its utility in calculating the probability of miss. For practical values of the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR), a series solution for the characteristic function of the lognormal random variable is used to find the probability of miss.

The mathematical framework here developed allows the evaluation of both the bit error probability and the bit error outage in downlink with perfect and imperfect channel state information and the derivation of the TORC threshold that optimizes the performance. The optimal threshold is analytically derived as a function of the number of subcarriers, the number of active users, and the mean signal-to-noise ratio.

Numerical results show very good performance of TORC with optimal threshold comparing with others combining techniques with perfect and imperfect channel estimation.

Considering average received-power constraint, we derive the ergodic and outage capacities along with their optimum power allocation policies for Rayleigh flat-fading channels, and provide closedform expressions for these capacity metrics. We further assume that the interference power inflicted on the primaryiquests receiver should remain below a peak threshold. Introducing the concept of interference-outage, we derive lower bounds on the ergodic and outage capacities of the channel. In addition, we obtain closedform expressions for the expenditure-power required at the secondary transmitter to achieve the above-mentioned capacity metrics.

Three examples are demonstrated. In the first example, the autocorrelated Nakagami channel is generated. The second example is designed to generate correlated 2x2 MIMO Rayleigh channels. In the third example, the proposed approach generates three correlated channels having Nakagami, Rician, and Rayleigh pdfs. The settings of the first two examples are adopted from previously published results, which are intended to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach to tackle previously known problems.

This scheme can be considered as a extension of the zero-forcing (ZF) channel inversion to the case where each receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. One of the limitation of the BD is that the sum rate does not grow linearly with the number of users and transmit antennas at low and medium signal-to-noise ratio regime, since the complete suppression of multi-user interference is achieved at the expense of noise enhancement. Also it performs poorly under imperfect channel state information. In this paper, we propose a generalized minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel inversion algorithm for users with multiple antennas to overcome the drawbacks of the BD for multiuser MIMO systems. We first introduce a generalized ZF channel inversion algorithm as a new approach of the conventional BD. Applying this idea to the MMSE channel inversion for identifying orthonormal basis vectors of the precoder, and employing the MMSE criterion for finding its combining matrix, the proposed scheme increases the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at each user's receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme exhibits a linear growth of the sum rate, as opposed to the BD scheme. For block fading channels with four transmit antennas, the proposed scheme provides a 3 dB gain over the conventional BD scheme at 1% frame error rate. Also, we present a modified precoding method for systems with channel estimation errors and show that the proposed algorithm is robust to channel estimation errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5336830/05336870.pdf","startPage":"3489","endPage":"3499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.070404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.070404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Channel Inversion Methods for Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Broadcasting","Receiving antennas","Interference suppression","Channel state information","Vectors","Signal processing","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","fading channels","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized channel inversion methods","multiuser MIMO systems","block diagonalization","precoding method","multiuser multi-input multi-output broadcast channels","zero-forcing channel inversion","multiple antennas","generalized minimum mean-squared error channel inversion algorithm","multiuser interference","noise enhancement","imperfect channel state information","MMSE channel inversion","block fading channels","channel estimation errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multiuser, broadcast channels (BC), linear precoding, minimum meansquared error (MMSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Channel Inversion Methods for Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5336870/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985720","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Channel Inversion Methods for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"3489-tc0911-sung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083949S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5336830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"5336830","articleId":"5336870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5336871,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond H.Y.

The spectral inefficiency caused by the spectrum holes motivated cognitive radio technology (CR) that presents unlicensed secondary users (SUs) an opportunity for using spectrum holes. CR makes the SUs to find and use the spectrum holes without interrupting the operation of PUs. The SUs are allowed to access the channel licensed to the PUs which consist of primary transmitters (PTs) and primary receivers (PRs) when the interference to the PRs is less than acceptable value (i.e., predefined system threshold), and the quality of service (QoS) required by PTs are also guaranteed. According to different levels of QoS required by SUs, the network operator can achieve different secondary revenues by providing different QoS levels to SUs. Due to the high density, the mobility of SUs, the interference limitation at PRs and the QoS requirements from PTs, not all SUs can be supported. The problem we investigated in this paper is to select the maximum subset of SUs to maximize the total secondary revenue of the CogCell, meanwhile the QoS requirements from both PTs and admitted SUs must be guaranteed. Moreover, the interference caused by the admitted SUs and the PTs at the PRs (due to access the same channel) has to be less than the predefined system threshold. In this paper, we formulate such a joint QoS-aware admission control, channel assignment, and power allocation scheme as a non-linear NP-hard optimization problem. This is a very challenging problem and the NP-hardness has been shown in the literature even for the single-channel scenario.

From the perspective of secondary users, spectrum availability is a time varying network resource over which multi-hop end-to-end connections must be maintained. In this work, a theoretical outlook on the problem of routing secondary user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation aims to characterize optimal sequences of routes over which a secondary flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel metric that considers the maintenance cost of a route as channels and/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated as an integer programming optimization model and shown to be of polynomial time complexity in case of full knowledge of primary user activity. Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged to design a heuristic algorithm to solve the minimum maintenance cost routing problem when information on primary user activity is not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality gap of the heuristic routing algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336987","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312767/5336910/05336987.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336987","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","startPage":"284","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum maintenance cost routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Minimum maintenance cost routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336987/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977943","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum maintenance cost routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"M30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071927S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312767","isNumber":"5336910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312767","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5336910","articleId":"5336987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5336989,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310514000"},{"name":"Shaojie Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37305070700"},{"name":"Xiang-Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","Institute of Computer Application Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China","Department of Computer Science, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37280866600"},{"name":"Changjun Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Changjun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272618800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5114-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5113-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"5336989","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336989","abstract":"In this paper, we study the capacity of cognitive networks.

Many emerging mobile wireless applications require peer-to-peer transmissions over an ad hoc network, where the nodes often have different number of antennas, and the channel condition and network topology vary over time. It is important and challenging to develop efficient schemes to distributively coordinate transmission resource sharing among a heterogeneous group of nodes over an infrastructure-free mobile ad hoc network. In this work, we propose a holistic distributed scheduling algorithm that can adaptively select different transmission strategies based on the node types and channel conditions to effectively relieve the bottleneck effect caused by nodes with smaller antenna arrays, and avoid transmission failure due to violation of channel constraint. The algorithm also takes advantage of channel information to opportunistically schedule cooperative spatial multiplexed transmissions between nodes and provide special transmission support for higher priority nodes with weak channels, so that the data rate of the network can be maximized while user transmission quality requirement is supported. The performance of our algorithm is studied through extensive simulations and the results demonstrate that our algorithm is very effective in handling node heterogeneity and channel constraint, and can significantly increase the throughput while reducing the transmission delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and distributed scheduling in heterogeneous MIMO-based ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336995","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312767/5336910/05336995.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5336995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5336995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and distributed scheduling in heterogeneous MIMO-based ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5336995/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978010","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive and distributed scheduling in heterogeneous MIMO-based ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"M23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05483S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312767","isNumber":"5336910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312767","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5336910","articleId":"5336995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5337007,"authors":[{"name":"Pangun Park","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pangun","lastName":"Park","id":"37530172400"},{"name":"Piergiuseppe Di Marco","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Piergiuseppe","lastName":"Di Marco","id":"37392113100"},{"name":"Pablo Soldati","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Soldati","id":"37296989100"},{"name":"Carlo Fischione","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Fischione","id":"37269548800"},{"name":"Karl Henrik Johansson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl Henrik","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37270842500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5114-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5113-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"5337007","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2313},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized Markov chain model for effective analysis of slotted IEEE 802.15.4","abstract":"A generalized analysis of the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC) protocol in terms of reliability, delay and energy consumption is presented. The IEEE 802.15.4 exponential backoff process is modeled through a Markov chain taking into account retry limits, acknowledgements, and unsaturated traffic. Simple and effective approximations of the reliability, delay and energy consumption under low traffic regime are proposed. It is demonstrated that the delay distribution of IEEE 802.15.4 depends mainly on MAC parameters and collision probability. In addition, the impact of MAC parameters on the performance metrics is analyzed. The analysis is more general and gives more accurate results than existing methods in the literature. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed approximations offer a satisfactory accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5337007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5337007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336910","startPage":"130","endPage":"139","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312767/5336910/05337007.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337007","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Traffic control","Media Access Protocol","Delay effects","Wireless sensor networks","Throughput","Access protocols","Road accidents","Measurement","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","Markov processes","probability","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized Markov chain model","slotted IEEE 802.15.4","medium access control protocol","network reliability","energy consumption","exponential backoff process","unsaturated traffic","delay distribution","collision probability","wireless sensor network","performance metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.15.4 standard","Markov chain model","Retry limits and acknowledgement","Model approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A generalized Markov chain model for effective analysis of slotted IEEE 802.15.4","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978016","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5337007/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337007/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized Markov chain model for effective analysis of slotted IEEE 802.15.4","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"M14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077398S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312767","isNumber":"5336910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312767","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5336910","articleId":"5337007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":5337016,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Shian Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Shian","lastName":"Li","id":"37310378800"},{"name":"Ching-Fang Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537200000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5114-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5113-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"5337016","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"abstract":"In the wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor nodes may be deployed in the hostile areas. The eavesdropper can intercept the messages in the public channel and the communication between the nodes is easily monitored. Furthermore, any malicious intermediate node can act as a legal receiver to alter the passing messages. Hence, message protection and sensor node identification become important issues in WSN. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme providing unconditional secure communication based on the quantum characteristics, including no-cloning and teleportation. We present a random EPR-pair allocation scheme that is designed to overcome the vulnerability caused by possible compromised nodes. EPR pairs are pre-assigned to sensor nodes randomly and the entangled qubits are used by the nodes with the quantum teleportation scheme to form a secure link. We also show a scheme on how to resist the man-in-the-middle attack. In the framework, the qubits are allocated to each node before deployment and the adversary is unable to create the duplicated nodes. Even if the malicious nodes are added to the network to falsify the messages transmitting in the public channel, the legal nodes can easily detect the fake nodes that have no entangled qubits and verify the counterfeit messages. In addition, we prove that one node sharing EPR pairs with a certain amount of neighbor nodes can teleport information to any node in the sensor network if there are sufficient EPR pairs in the qubits pool. The proposal shows that the distributed quantum wireless sensor network gains better security than classical wireless sensor network and centralized quantum wireless network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5312767/5336910/05337016.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1029","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5337016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5337016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum communication in distributed wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Paramagnetic resonance","Law","Legal factors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Teleportation","Monitoring","Protection","Quantum entanglement","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum communication","quantum entanglement","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum communication","distributed wireless sensor network","public channel","message passing","communication security","random EPR-pair allocation scheme","WSN vulnerability","qubit entanglement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["no-cloning","teleportation","EPR pair allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantum communication in distributed wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337016/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977935","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum communication in distributed wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"M130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05129S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5312767","isNumber":"5336910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5312767","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5336910","articleId":"5337016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5337055,"authors":[{"name":"H.Q.

In this letter, a TV CE method for practical OFDMA systems is proposed. The time variations of the frequency domain transmission function in one symbol period are approximated by a linear model in time-frequency blocks for each user.

To achieve real-time pedestrian recognition on embedded systems, we propose hardware architecture suitable for HOG feature extraction, which is a popular method for high-accuracy pedestrian recognition. To reduce computational complexity toward efficient hardware architecture, this paper proposes several methods to simplify the computation of HOG feature extraction, such as conversion of the division, square root, arctangent to more simple operations. To show that such simplifications do not spoil the recognition accuracy, the detection performance is also evaluated using a support vector machine. Moreover, we implement the proposed architecture on an ALTERA Stratix II FPGA using Verilog HDL to evaluate the circuit size and the processing performance of the proposed architecture. Implementation results show that real-time processing for 30 fps VGA video can be achieved if 10 instances of the proposed hardware are used in parallel.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.216","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337074/5337075/05337209.pdf","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Architecture for HOG Feature Extraction","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046133","htmlLink":"/document/5337209/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Architecture for HOG Feature Extraction","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3762b330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072899S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337074","isNumber":"5337075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337074","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5337075","articleId":"5337209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5337224,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chien Yen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chung Chou Institute of Technology, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Chien","lastName":"Yen","id":"37548442600"},{"name":"Yen-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chung Chou Institute of Technology, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185514600"},{"name":"Ying-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Chung Chou Institute of Technology, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37676009800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4717-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3762-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5337224","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Shape","Wavelet analysis","Image resolution","Wavelet coefficients","Discrete wavelet transforms","Biomedical imaging","Satellites","Time frequency analysis","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image enhancement","image resolution","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enlargement method","undecimated discrete wavelet transform","shape function","time-frequency localization","multiresolution analysis","image resolution enhancement","image interpolation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","Enlargement Method","Undecimated Wavelet Transform"]}],"abstract":"The enlargement method is a partial technology in many application including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. Due to the wavelet representation has characteristics of the efficient time-frequency localization and the multi-resolution analysis, the wavelet transforms are suitable for processing the image resolution enhancement. Therefore, this method focuses on wavelet-based image resolution enhancement and proposes a framework of enlargement method. This proposed method is based on the estimation of detail wavelet coefficients at high resolution scales. The method exploits shape function according to wavelet coefficient correlation in a local neighborhood and employs undecimated discrete wavelet transform to estimate the unknown detail coefficients.

The number of codes searched decides the speed of the code assignment scheme and can be very significant QoS factor for delay prone services like voice transmission, video conferencing etc. Also the code assignment schemes are compared for code blocking which leads to loss in spectral efficiency of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vacant Code Searching and Selection of Optimum Code Assignment Scheme in WCDMA Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2009.40","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337083/5337084/05337282.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2009.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Vacant Code Searching and Selection of Optimum Code Assignment Scheme in WCDMA Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337282/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977104","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vacant Code Searching and Selection of Optimum Code Assignment Scheme in WCDMA Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3786a224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062427S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337083","isNumber":"5337084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337083","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5337084","articleId":"5337282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5337285,"authors":[{"name":"Huayu Zhou","affiliation":["TCL Corporation Research, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Huayu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37675983500"},{"name":"Hui Tang","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tang","id":"37671530700"},{"name":"Qin Zhang","affiliation":["Cyber TAN Technology, Inc., Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087913428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3786-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"}],"articleNumber":"5337285","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337285","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Interference cancellation","Detection algorithms","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Computer errors","Size control","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decision feedback equalisers","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint detection algorithm","MMSE decision feedback equalization","interference cancellation","minimum mean square error","sliding-window decision feedback equalization","TDD-CDMA","time division duplex-code division multiple access","block decision feedback equalization","V-BLAST"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337084","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2009.44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Detection Based on MMSE Decision Feedback Equalization with Interference Cancellation","startPage":"219","endPage":"223","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337083/5337084/05337285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2009.44","abstract":"MMSE-DFE (Minimum Mean Square Error-Decision Feedback Equalization) is a sliding-window decision feedback equalization method.

However it needs many candidates to obtain preferable PAPR performance, which will result in high computational complexity. In order to alleviate the problem, this paper proposes a novel partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique, in which real and imaginary parts of the candidate are separately multiplied with phase factors, moreover, PAPR is conjointly optimized in real part and imaginary part. In this scheme, the number of candidates is increased so that the PAPR performance is improved with less increase of complexity. Simulation results show that the PAPR performance of the proposed scheme is better than that of the conventional PTS scheme. Furthermore, compared with widely-linear selective mapping (SLM) scheme, the proposed scheme has the near PAPR performance and lower computational complexity for the same number of candidates.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2009.91","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337083/5337084/05337288.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2009.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel PTS Technique with Combinative Optimization in Real Part and Imaginary Part for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337288/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel PTS Technique with Combinative Optimization in Real Part and Imaginary Part for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977106","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337288/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel PTS Technique with Combinative Optimization in Real Part and Imaginary Part for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3786a215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079872S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337083","isNumber":"5337084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337083","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5337084","articleId":"5337288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5337296,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ji-Hong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677468700"},{"name":"Chin-Hsing Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Hsing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351224600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4717-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3762-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5337296","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Multiaccess communication","Discrete wavelet transforms","Modulation coding","Copyright protection","Authentication","Internet","Communication channels","Jamming","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","code division multiple access","discrete wavelet transforms","multimedia communication","telecommunication channels","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["watermarking scheme","code division multiple access","copyright protection","multimedia data authentication","communication channel","discrete wavelet transform","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","Code Division Multiple Access","Toral Automorphism"]}],"abstract":"Watermarking is a potential method for copyright protection and multimedia data authentication in the Internet.

In this paper, a novel watermarking scheme using code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation is proposed to achieve a superior performance in terms of robustness and imperceptibility. In the proposed scheme, three watermark bits are modulated to five bits CDMA code. Then the CDMA code is embedded in the coefficients of a DWT domain. To explore the utility and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, simulations under various conditions are conducted. The empirical results show that our proposed scheme can stand up against most common attacks.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.207","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337074/5337075/05337296.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Watermarking Scheme Using Code Division Multiple Access and DWT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337296/","displayDocTitle":"A Watermarking Scheme Using Code Division Multiple Access and DWT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977306","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337296/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Watermarking Scheme Using Code Division Multiple Access and DWT","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3762a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061645S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337074","isNumber":"5337075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337074","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5337075","articleId":"5337296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5337302,"authors":[{"name":"Akio Ogihara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Ogihara","id":"37565113600"},{"name":"Harumi Murata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Harumi","lastName":"Murata","id":"37593056300"},{"name":"Motoi Iwata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Iwata","id":"37548412500"},{"name":"Akira Shiozaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Shiozaki","id":"37326096400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4717-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3762-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5337302","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Data mining","Digital audio players","Robustness","Multimedia systems","Signal processing","Computer science","Intelligent systems","Internet","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","data compression","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer audio watermarking","low-frequency amplitude modification","MP3 compression","plural data channel","extraction accuracy","data capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["audio watermarking","music watermarking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337302","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337075","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337074/5337075/05337302.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Layer Audio Watermarking Based on Amplitude Modification","abstract":"In the conventional method proposed by W.N.Lie et al., it is difficult to satisfy both the capacity of watermark information and the robustness to MP3 compression.

The goal of this study is to define and demonstrate a technique for determining the optimal resistor value.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.98","startPage":"530","endPage":"533","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337075","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337074/5337075/05337355.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Thermistor Linearization Using LabVIEW","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337355/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Thermistor Linearization Using LabVIEW","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337355/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10977343","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Thermistor Linearization Using LabVIEW","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3762a530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038102S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337074","isNumber":"5337075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337074","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5337075","articleId":"5337355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5337434,"authors":[{"name":"Gyanendra Prasad Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyanendra Prasad","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37320306600"},{"name":"Sung Won Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Won","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279276600"},{"name":"Byung-Seo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Communication Engineering, Hongik University, Chungnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Seo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3786-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"}],"articleNumber":"5337434","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Access protocols","Interference","Maintenance","Telecommunication network reliability","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel allocation","cognitive radio","probability","radio networks","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic cognitive radio network","spectrum hole utilization","next-generation radio system","incumbent system interference","decentralized adaptive medium access control protocol","AMAC protocol","dedicated global reliable common control channel","CCC","resource utilization","channel status table indexing","probability","data communication mode","network data throughput","network connectivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","MAC protocol","common control channel","cognitive MAC"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient MAC Protocol for Improving the Network Throughput for Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2009.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337084","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337083/5337084/05337434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2009.38","startPage":"271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337434","abstract":"The limitation of spectrum has become a major bottleneck of the development of next generation radio system. One of the key challenges of the emerging opportunistic cognitive radio is how to utilize unused spectrum holes efficiently without interference to incumbent system. Assuming that channel status is known, in this paper, we propose a decentralized adaptive medium access control (AMAC) protocol that has no dedicated global common control channel (CCC) and can utilize available resources efficiently. In AMAC, each cognitive radio maintains channel status table and indexes them frequently. The channel that has more probability to be stable is ranked channel one. The most reliable common channel between communicating pair is selected as a CCC. We proposed two data communication mode according to the channel condition. The simulation results show that the proposed decentralized adaptive medium access control (AMAC) protocol significantly increases cognitive radio networks (CRNs) connectivity and data throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10977144","htmlLink":"/document/5337434/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient MAC Protocol for Improving the Network Throughput for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient MAC Protocol for Improving the Network Throughput for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3786a271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059936S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337083","isNumber":"5337084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337083","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5337084","articleId":"5337434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5337435,"authors":[{"name":"Haris Pervaiz","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Pervaiz","id":"37393517100"},{"name":"John Bigham","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bigham","id":"37274645600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3786-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"}],"articleNumber":"5337435","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Resource management","Bandwidth","Cellular networks","Multiagent systems","Next generation networking","Mobile computing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","optimisation","radio networks","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretical formulation","service provider","wireless network","analytic hierarchy process model","multinetwork environment","radio resource management","noncooperative manner","utility function evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game Theory","Network Selection","WiMAX","Competitive networks","Analytic Hierarchy Process"]}],"abstract":"Network Selection mechanisms play an important role in ensuring quality of service for users in a multi-network environment. These mechanisms handle the selection of an optimal wireless network to satisfy a user request. This paper proposes a radio resource management framework for integrated network selection mechanism control in multi- network environment as an interaction game between the service providers and customers in non-cooperative manner to maximize their rewards. The proposed scheme comprises two steps. The first applies the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the relative weights of the evaluative criteria according to customer preferences and network condition. The second calculates the payoffs based on the relative weights calculated in the previous step and a utility function evaluation by each wireless network of each customer. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model to achieve optimum network utility for the wireless networks along with optimizing the customer's satisfaction. The proposed model is preliminary and its contribution is to create an admission policy that can adapt to different coverage areas of a wireless network and depends on the priority of customers and their requirements.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2009.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337083/5337084/05337435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2009.28","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theoretical Formulation of Network Selection in Competing Wireless Networks: An Analytic Hierarchy Process Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretical Formulation of Network Selection in Competing Wireless Networks: An Analytic Hierarchy Process Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337435/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977145","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretical Formulation of Network Selection in Competing Wireless Networks: An Analytic Hierarchy Process Model","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3786a292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051599S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337083","isNumber":"5337084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337083","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5337084","articleId":"5337435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5337458,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Deitos","affiliation":["SAP Research, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Deitos","id":"37671122500"},{"name":"Florian Kerschbaum","affiliation":["SAP Research, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kerschbaum","id":"37270288200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3763-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"5337458","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Linear programming","Costs","Protocols","Information security","Supply chain management","Privacy","Production","Databases","Expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","data privacy","linear programming","probability","supply chain management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["private collaborative linear programming","secure linear programming","information sharing","supply chain management","information leakage","multiparty computation guarantee privacy","public indexes selection","secure permutation","probability-based technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear programming","secure multi-party computation","supply-chain optimization"]}],"abstract":"Although information sharing in supply chain management dramatically reduces costs, parties are reluctant to do so, mainly due to fear of information leakage. Solutions based on secure multi-party computation guarantee privacy and correctness, at an extra communication and computation cost. Efficiency is a major concern for practical solutions. The best known solution with public indexes selection is due to Li and Atallah. It has the drawback of requiring a secure permutation on every round of the protocol, which turns to be very expensive. We therefore, propose a probability-based technique to reduce the number of secure permutations required by such solution, improving overall practical performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Practical Performance on Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","publicationTitle":"2009 20th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Application","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2009.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 20th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337077/5337078/05337458.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving Practical Performance on Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337458/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977219","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Practical Performance on Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","confLoc":"Linz, Austria","sourcePdf":"3763a122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062245S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337077","isNumber":"5337078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337077","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5337078","articleId":"5337458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5337511,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Y.

In order to resolve this problem, this paper endeavors to classify them via the help of extension neural network (ENN), This paper has to demonstrate the advantages of extension theory, statistical theory is considered as a judgment method, whereby obtaining experimental data of extension neural network and perceptron for subsequent comparison. It has proved that extension is superior to the other algorithms in terms of classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337564/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10977469","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337564/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extension Neural Network Approach to Classification of Brain MRI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension Neural Network Approach to Classification of Brain MRI","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3762a515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047486S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337074","isNumber":"5337075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337074","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5337075","articleId":"5337564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5337641,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Killcoyne","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Biology"],"bio":{"p":["Sarah Killcoyne is the project manager of the informatics team tasked with developing data management systems, integration architecture, and general analysis tools under John Boyle at the Institute for Systems Biology.

Unique nanoscale CMOS issues related to millimeter-wave circuit design in the 65-nm node and beyond are addressed with an emphasis on transistor and top-level layout issues, low-voltage circuit topologies, and design flow. A Doppler transceiver and two receivers fabricated in a 65-nm GPLP CMOS technology are described, along with a single pole, double throw antenna switch with better than 5-dB insertion loss and 25-dB isolation in the entire 110-170-GHz band. The first receiver has an IQ architecture with a fundamental frequency voltage-controlled oscillator, and is intended for wideband passive imaging applications at 100 GHz. The measured noise figure and downconversion gain are 7-8 and 10.5 dB, respectively, while the 3-dB bandwidth extends from 85 to 100 GHz. The second receiver has double-sideband architecture, operates in the 135-145-GHz range (the highest for CMOS receivers), and features an 8-dB gain LNA, a double-balanced Gilbert cell mixer, and a dipole antenna. The 90-94-GHz Doppler transceiver, the highest frequency reported to date in CMOS, is intended for the remote monitoring of respiratory functions. A Doppler shift of 30 Hz, produced by a slow-moving (4.8 cm/s) target located at a distance of 1 m, was measured with a transmitter output power of approximately + 2 dBm and a phase noise of -90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The range correlation effect is demonstrated for the first time in CMOS by measuring the phase noise of the received baseband signal at 10-Hz offset, clearly indicating that 1/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n noise has been canceled and it does not pose a problem in short-range applications, where neither a phase-locked loop nor a frequency divider are needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337876/","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5337876/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11007367","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nanoscale CMOS Transceiver Design in the 90\u2013170-GHz Range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanoscale CMOS Transceiver Design in the 90\u2013170-GHz Range","sourcePdf":"tmtt-laskin-part2-2034071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099378S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5337876","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5337882,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Seok Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5508591/5337882/5337882-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Seok Park (S'95\u2013A'99\u2013M'04) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea, in 1991, 1993, and 1996, respectively, all in electronics engineering.","In 1997, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles.

By combining multiplication with accumulation and devising a hybrid type of carry save adder (CSA), the performance was improved. Since the accumulator that has the largest delay in MAC was merged into CSA, the overall performance was elevated. The proposed CSA tree uses 1's-complement-based radix-2 modified Booth's algorithm (MBA) and has the modified array for the sign extension in order to increase the bit density of the operands. The CSA propagates the carries to the least significant bits of the partial products and generates the least significant bits in advance to decrease the number of the input bits of the final adder. Also, the proposed MAC accumulates the intermediate results in the type of sum and carry bits instead of the output of the final adder, which made it possible to optimize the pipeline scheme to improve the performance. The proposed architecture was synthesized with 250, 180 and 130 \u00bfm, and 90 nm standard CMOS library. Based on the theoretical and experimental estimation, we analyzed the results such as the amount of hardware resources, delay, and pipelining scheme. We used Sakurai's alpha power law for the delay modeling. The proposed MAC showed the superior properties to the standard design in many ways and performance twice as much as the previous research in the similar clock frequency. We expect that the proposed MAC can be adapted to various fields requiring high performance such as the signal processing areas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071374","htmlLink":"/document/5337888/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New VLSI Architecture of Parallel Multiplier\u2013Accumulator Based on Radix-2 Modified Booth Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New VLSI Architecture of Parallel Multiplier\u2013Accumulator Based on Radix-2 Modified Booth Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yseo-2009113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151878S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"5337888","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337896,"authors":[{"name":"Anandarup Das","affiliation":["Center for Electronics Design and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5463201/5337896/5337896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anandarup Das (S\u201908) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Bengal Engineering College, Kolkata, India, in 2002 and the M.Tech. degree in power electronics from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi, India, in 2006.

The present work further improves the existing dodecagonal space vector diagrams by dividing the space vector plane into six concentric dodecagons, while retaining the aforementioned advantages. A high-resolution pulsewidth modulation strategy is developed in this paper, which compared to existing schemes, reduces the harmonic content of the motor phase voltage without resorting to higher switching frequency. A comparative study of output voltage quality produced by the proposed topology and a five-level inverter shows substantial improvement in the present work. At the same time, the present topology does not require any special design of the inverter and uses two popular three-level NPC inverters. Experimental verification on a laboratory prototype indicates the possible application of this concept for high power drives.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5463201/05337896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463201","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Voltage Space Vector Diagram Formed by Six Concentric Dodecagons for Induction Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Voltage Space Vector Diagram Formed by Six Concentric Dodecagons for Induction Motor Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328497","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5337896/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Voltage Space Vector Diagram Formed by Six Concentric Dodecagons for Induction Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-gopakumar-2036729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104558S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5463201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5463201","articleId":"5337896","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5337903,"authors":[{"name":"Erick Emmanuel Djoumessi","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Poly Grames Research Center, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5379166/5337903/5337903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erick Emmanuel Djoumessi (S'08) received the Bachelor degree in engineering telecommunications and Master degree in electrical engineering from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al.","His research interests concern the design of multiband and reconfigurable microwave components and systems based on silicon and ferroelectric varactors for SDCR applications.","Mr. Djoumessi was a finalist in the 2009 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (IEEE MTT-S) International Microwave Symposium (IMS) Student Paper Competition."]},"firstName":"Erick Emmanuel","lastName":"Djoumessi","id":"37398946300"},{"name":"Serioja O.

In order to demodulate phase-shift-keying modulated signals at multiple operating frequencies at a high bit rate of 40 Mb/s, the receiver is designed using a wideband power detector in connection with a high-speed quad comparator. An experimental prototype and a complete measurement test bench have been realized in order to obtain the bit error rate performance of the receiver in a more realistic application environment.

The DG unit utilizes a voltage-sourced converter (VSC) as the interface medium. The controller design is obtained by introducing a new optimal controller design procedure, in conjunction with a proposed non-conservative robustness constraint. The proposed controller utilizes 1) an internal oscillator for frequency control and 2) a robust servomechanism controller (RSC) to regulate the island voltage. Despite uncertainty of the load parameters, the proposed controller guarantees robust stability and pre-specified performance criteria, e.g., fast transient response and zero steady-state error. The theoretical aspects of the proposed robust servomechanism controller including the existence conditions, design of the controller, and robust stability analysis of the closed-loop system are studied. Moreover, the performance of the robust servomechanism controller based on 1) simulation studies in the MATLAB software environment, and 2) experiments in a laboratory-scale setup, is presented in this paper. In particular, reference signal tracking and robustness of the closed-loop system with respect to the load parameter uncertainty are investigated. Both computer simulation studies and experimental results confirm that the proposed robust controller provides the specified performance characteristics of the closed-loop system.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05337905.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2031441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable Servomechanism Controller for Autonomous Operation of a Distributed Generation Unit: Design and Performance Evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337905/","displayDocTitle":"Multivariable Servomechanism Controller for Autonomous Operation of a Distributed Generation Unit: Design and Performance Evaluation","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256794","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5337905/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable Servomechanism Controller for Autonomous Operation of a Distributed Generation Unit: Design and Performance Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-hkarimi-2031441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11601S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5337905","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5337909,"authors":[{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Department of Cogno Mechatronics Engineering, Graduate School, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Center of Offshore Research and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/5556461/5337909/5337909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuzhi Sam Ge (S'90\u2013M'92\u2013SM'99\u2013F'06) received the B.Sc. degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA), Beijing, China, in 1986, and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of London, London, U.K., in 1993.","He is the founding Director of the Social Robotics Lab, Interactive Digital Media Institute, and a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the National University of Singapore, Singapore.

The dynamic behavior of the flexible riser is represented by a distributed parameter system with partial differential equations (PDEs) and the control is applied at the top boundary of the riser based on Lyapunov's direct method to regulate the riser's vibrations. With the proposed boundary control, uniform boundedness under ocean current disturbance, and exponential stability under free vibration condition can be achieved. The proposed control is independent of system parameters, which ensures the robustness of the system to variations in parameters. Numerical simulations for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed control are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5556461/05337909.pdf","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2033574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2033574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boundary Control of a Coupled Nonlinear Flexible Marine Riser","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Vibration control","Control systems","Actuators","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Distributed parameter systems","Partial differential equations","Oceans","Stability","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","distributed parameter systems","Lyapunov methods","marine systems","partial differential equations","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary control","coupled nonlinear flexible marine riser","actuators","vibrations","distributed parameter system","partial differential equations","Lyapunovs direct method","exponential stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary control","distributed parameter system","exponential stability","Lyapunov's direct method","partial differential equations (PDEs)","uniform boundedness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Boundary Control of a Coupled Nonlinear Flexible Marine Riser","volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5337909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11477355","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boundary Control of a Coupled Nonlinear Flexible Marine Riser","sourcePdf":"tcst-ge-2033574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137874S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5556461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5556461","articleId":"5337909","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337912,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Liang","affiliation":["CLP Research Institute Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jian Liang received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and automation engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in 2006.","His research interests are power and energy technologies.

Deliberate physical-layer attacks, such as high-powered jamming, can seriously degrade network performance and must be dealt with efficiently. While most approaches are focused on the developing fast detection and reaction mechanisms triggered in case of an attack, we propose a novel approach to help deal with these issues in the network planning and provisioning process as a prevention mechanism. Namely, we propose to route lightpaths in such a way as to minimize the potential damage caused by various physical-layer attacks. We present a new objective criterion for the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which we call the maximum Lightpath Attack Radius \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(</i>\nmaxLAR), and formulate the routing subproblem as an integer linear program (ILP). We test it on small networks to get an insight into its complexity and compare it to a formulation that minimizes congestion. Results indicate that our formulation achieves significantly better results for the maxLAR while obtaining near-optimal or optimal congestion in all cases. For larger networks, we propose a tabu search algorithm for attack-aware lightpath routing, in combination with an existing graph-coloring algorithm for wavelength assignment. Testing and comparing with existing approaches from literature indicate its superiority with respect to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">maxLAR</i>\n and average lightpath load, albeit at the expense of somewhat higher congestion.

Some of the configurations used in present cryogenic front-ends, such as sideband separating mixers and balanced amplifiers, require 90\u00b0 hybrids as a part of the intermediate frequency (IF) circuitry. A very common choice for the band of operation of these hybrids is 4-12-GHz band. There are devices commercially available covering this band with good ambient temperature characteristics, but their cryogenic performance degrades to unacceptable levels. This paper describes the design, construction and measurement of a multioctave stripline hybrid for the 4-12 GHz band specially conceived to operate satisfactorily when cooled down to 15 K (-258\u00b0C). The materials and mechanical construction have been carefully selected and the result is a very compact, reliable and low thermal mass device, capable to withstand extreme thermal cycling. The coupling and reflection characteristics of the prototype show very low temperature dependence. The utility of the hybrid developed is demonstrated in a cryogenic balanced amplifier. The noise temperature obtained using this configuration (6 K) shows clear advantage (about 33%) over the classical isolator-amplifier combination normally used in heterodyne radio astronomy receivers. Besides, a superior insensitivity of the amplifier's noise performance to the input termination mismatch is obtained.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5340253/05337933.pdf","startPage":"3239","endPage":"3245","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic Hybrid Coupler for Ultra-Low-Noise Radio Astronomy Balanced Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic Hybrid Coupler for Ultra-Low-Noise Radio Astronomy Balanced Amplifiers","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5337933/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007361","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic Hybrid Coupler for Ultra-Low-Noise Radio Astronomy Balanced Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"57tmtt12-imalo-gomez-part2-2033874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077474S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5337933","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5337934,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5379166/5337934/5337934-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Jian Cheng (S'08) was born in Sichuan Province, China, in April 1983.

Since the SIW is a dispersive guided-wave structure, the effective bandwidth of SIW phase shifter is usually narrow. Phase shifts generated by two different structures, namely delay line and equal-length unequal-width phase shifter, are discovered in this work to present interesting opposite tendencies versus frequency. Therefore, an appropriate combination of them will make the phase shift almost constant over a very wide band. Design equations and process are given following a mathematical analysis. To demonstrate the interesting and useful features of the proposed technique, a 90\u00b0 and a 45\u00b0 self-compensating phase shifters are designed as showcases with standard printed circuit board process. For the 90\u00b0 version, the measured amplitude and phase imbalance between the two paths are within 0.2 dB and 2.5\u00b0 , respectively, within the frequency band from 25.11 to 39.75 GHz, or around 49% bandwidth. The return loss is found to be better than 12 dB within the frequency band of interest. The 45\u00b0 one has the similar excellent performance.

Nanoelectronics (circuits built with components on the scale of 10 nm) seem to be the most promising successor to lithographic based ICs. Molecular-scale devices including diodes, bistable switches, carbon nanotubes, and nanowires have been fabricated and characterized in chemistry labs. Techniques for self-assembling these devices into different architectures have also been demonstrated and used to build small-scale prototypes. While these devices and assembly techniques will lead to nanoscale electronics, they also have the drawback of being prone to defects and transient faults. Fault-tolerance techniques will be crucial to the use of nanoelectronics. Lastly, changes to the software tools that support the fabrication and use of ICs will be needed to extend them to support nanoelectronics.

When the input conditions are uncertain, numerous scenarios need to be analyzed to cover the required range of uncertainty. Under such conditions, reliable solution algorithms that incorporate the effect of data uncertainty into the power flow analysis are required. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new solution methodology based on the use of affine arithmetic, which is an enhanced model for self-validated numerical analysis in which the quantities of interest are represented as affine combinations of certain primitive variables representing the sources of uncertainty in the data or approximations made during the computation. The application of this technique to the power flow problem is explained in detail, and several numerical results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, especially in comparison to previously proposed interval arithmetic's techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11256773","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5337942/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Affine Arithmetic-Based Methodology for Reliable Power Flow Analysis in the Presence of Data Uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Affine Arithmetic-Based Methodology for Reliable Power Flow Analysis in the Presence of Data Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-vaccaro-2032774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096553S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5337942","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5337947,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37675699700"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406086600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5337947","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This letter considers the relay-assisted multiuser downlink transmission with limited feedback in a wireless cellular network. Taking into account the channel quantization errors, we propose two robust linear beamforming schemes at the relay station based on zero forcing (ZF) criterion and minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, respectively. It is noted that the channel direction information (CDI) feedback is sufficient for determining the beamforming vectors in our proposed schemes, which reduces the feedback load. Simulation results show that compared with the conventional ZF beamforming and MMSE beamforming in limited feedback systems, the proposed precoding schemes achieve an improvement in the average bit error rate (BER) performance of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5314170/05337947.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2036877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2036877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Linear Beamforming for MIMO Relay Broadcast Channel With Limited Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","MIMO","Relays","Broadcasting","Feedback","Bit error rate","Downlink","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","cellular radio","error statistics","feedback","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust linear beamforming","MIMO relay broadcast channel","relay-assisted multiuser downlink transmission","wireless cellular network","minimum mean square error","channel direction information feedback","limited feedback systems","average bit error rate performance","channel quantization errors","precoding schemes","zero forcing criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","limited feedback","MIMO relay","MMSE","ZF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Linear Beamforming for MIMO Relay Broadcast Channel With Limited Feedback","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5337947/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118757","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Linear Beamforming for MIMO Relay Broadcast Channel With Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"17lsp02-bzhang-2036877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064017S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5314170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5314170","articleId":"5337947","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337949,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5510034/5337949/5337949-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zeng-Guang Hou (M'05\u2013SM'09) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Yanshan University (formerly Northeast Heavy Machinery Institute), Qinhuangdao, China, in 1991 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1997.","From May 1997 to June 1999, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Laboratory of Systems and Control, Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

The performance criteria for single robots provided by Nedungadi and Kazerounian are generalized to a multicriteria form for the coordinated-manipulation system composed of multiple serial manipulators. By optimizing the local joint torques and generalized forces applied on the object/workpiece using a designed weighting matrix, the proposed method achieves the global stability during the coordinated-manipulation process. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has an explicit physical meaning, i.e., both the global kinetic energy of the coordination system and the two-norm of the generalized forces applied on the object are minimized simultaneously. In addition, the physical limits of both joint torques and the generalized forces applied on the object are considered, which makes the original coordination problem become a complicated optimization problem subject to both equality and inequality constraints. Compared with numerical optimization algorithms used in existing literatures, the dual neural-network method has better computational capability to deal with the complicated optimization problem. Finally, illustrative examples are given to show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for the multirobot coordinated-manipulation system.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2034073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5510034/05337949.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2034073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510034","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicriteria Optimization for Coordination of Redundant Robots Using a Dual Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multicriteria Optimization for Coordination of Redundant Robots Using a Dual Neural Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11416566","pubMedId":"19923050","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5337949/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicriteria Optimization for Coordination of Redundant Robots Using a Dual Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-hou-2034073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07844S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5510034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5510034","articleId":"5337949","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337951,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Ren","affiliation":["Center of Microwave and RF Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhen Ren received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic information and electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently with the Center for Microwave and RF Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Because we develop a coherent scattering model, preserving the relative position of plant elements in a statistical manner as accurately as possible is very important. Shrubs are reproduced using cylindrical elements which represent trunks, branches, and thin green stems that function as leaves for these shrubs. Their crown shape is highly irregular, but for the most part can be encompassed in an ellipsoidal or cylindrical volume; on the other hand, the grass is represented as a set of cylindrical stalks and blade leaves. The scattered power from each grass element is added because multiple scattering among adjacent elements can be neglected at microwave frequencies. We calculate the soil scattering using the Integral Equation Method and neglect the soil volume scattering which may become significant for dry soil condition at high incidence angles. Backscatter statistics are acquired via a Monte Carlo simulation over a large number of realizations. The accuracy of the model is verified using measured data acquired by the C-band environmental satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar instrument at different incident angles.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05337955.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipolarization Microwave Scattering Model for Sahelian Grassland","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5337955/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multipolarization Microwave Scattering Model for Sahelian Grassland","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138153","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipolarization Microwave Scattering Model for Sahelian Grassland","sourcePdf":"tgrs-monsivaishuertero-2032173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.260379S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5337955","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5337956,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanshan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5371895/5337956/5337956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhanshan Wang (M'09) was born in Liaoning, China, in 1971.

This paper analyzes NCL and reveals that the training of NCL (when \u00bf = 1) corresponds to training the entire ensemble as a single learning machine that only minimizes the MSE without regularization. This analysis explains the reason why NCL is prone to overfitting the noise in the training set. This paper also demonstrates that tuning the correlation parameter \u00bf in NCL by cross validation cannot overcome the overfitting problem. The paper analyzes this problem and proposes the regularized negative correlation learning (RNCL) algorithm which incorporates an additional regularization term for the whole ensemble. RNCL decomposes the ensemble's training objectives, including MSE and regularization, into a set of sub-objectives, and each sub-objective is implemented by an individual neural network. In this paper, we also provide a Bayesian interpretation for RNCL and provide an automatic algorithm to optimize regularization parameters based on Bayesian inference. The RNCL formulation is applicable to any nonlinear estimator minimizing the MSE.

To determine useful data to be learned and remove redundant ones, a subjective information measure called surprise is introduced. Surprise captures the amount of information a datum contains which is transferable to a learning system. Based on this concept, we propose a systematic sparsification scheme, which can drastically reduce the time and space complexity without harming the performance of kernel adaptive filters. Nonlinear regression, short term chaotic time-series prediction, and long term time-series forecasting examples are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5338643/05337958.pdf","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2033676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2033676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Information Theoretic Approach of Designing Sparse Kernel Adaptive Filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Adaptive filters","Training data","Least squares approximation","Weather forecasting","Signal processing algorithms","Least squares methods","Learning systems","Chaos","Biomedical measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","information theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","sparse kernel adaptive filter","information measure","surprise","learning system","systematic sparsification","time complexity","space complexity","nonlinear regression","short term chaotic time-series prediction","long term time-series forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information measure","kernel adaptive filters","online Gaussian processes","online kernel learning","sparsification","surprise"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Humans","Information Theory","Least-Squares Analysis","Nonlinear Dynamics","Time Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Information Theoretic Approach of Designing Sparse Kernel Adaptive Filters","volume":"20","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5337958/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004874","pubMedId":"19923047","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information Theoretic Approach of Designing Sparse Kernel Adaptive Filters","sourcePdf":"tnn-wliu-2033676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108624S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5338643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5338643","articleId":"5337958","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337960,"authors":[{"name":"Zeshui Xu","affiliation":["Antai School of Economic and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","Institute of Sciences, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5405632/5337960/5337960-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zeshui Xu (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in management science and engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003.","From April 2003 to May 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the School of Economics and Management, Southeast University.

Furthermore, we utilize the weighted PG and POWG operators, respectively, to develop an approach to group decision making based on multiplicative preference relations and utilize the weighted UPG and UPOWG operators, respectively, to develop an approach to group decision making based on uncertain multiplicative preference relations.

The distillation model is verified by real data. The FLC control algorithm usually consists of a transformer, a state estimator and an external linear controller. Here, two state estimators, namely extended Kalman filter (EKF) and short-cut model-based open-loop estimator (SMBOLE), have been developed to device the hybrid FLC-EKF and FLC-SMBOLE control systems, respectively. In order to avoid estimator design complexity as well as computational burden, an ideal binary distillation model [light key (LK)/heavy key (HK)] has been used as an EKF predictor and open-loop estimator (OLE). In this article, a comparative study has been conducted between the FLC-EKF, FLC-SMBOLE and a classical dual-loop proportional integral derivative (PID) control structure. Simulation results show that despite the significant process/model mismatch, the proposed FLC controllers perform better than the PID control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2034514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2034514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406290","startPage":"25","endPage":"35","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5406290/05337967.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337967","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature control","Open loop systems","State estimation","Three-term control","Linear feedback control systems","Control system synthesis","Predictive models","PD control","Pi control","Proportional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","Kalman filters","nonlinear control systems","open loop systems","state estimation","temperature control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid FLC-EKF scheme","temperature control","nonlinear feedback linearizing control","differential geometric framework","refinery debutanizer column","transformer","external linear controller","state estimators","extended Kalman filter","short-cut model-based open-loop estimator","dual-loop proportional integral derivative","PID control scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Debutanizer","extended Kalman filter","feedback linearizing control","short-cut model-based open-loop estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid FLC-EKF Scheme for Temperature Control of a Refinery Debutanizer Column","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105298","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5337967/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337967/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid FLC-EKF Scheme for Temperature Control of a Refinery Debutanizer Column","sourcePdf":"tii-ajana-2034514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201594S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5406290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5406290","articleId":"5337967","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5337969,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Benevides da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil","INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel Benevides","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5337969","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":720},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Performance analysis","Rayleigh channels","Bit error rate","Closed-form solution","Probability density function","Distribution functions","Signal generators","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection technique","clustered fixed-gain relay","selection cooperation","opportunistic relaying","Rayleigh fading","single-antenna device","outage probability","bit error rate","probability density function","cumulative distribution function","moment generating function","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustered setting","fixed-gain relays","performance analysis","relay selection"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we study the performance of two promising relay selection techniques, namely selection cooperation (SC) and opportunistic relaying (OPR), under a clustered fixed-gain relay setting. Such relay configuration finds applicability in practical ad-hoc and sensor networks, although it considers independent identically distributed channels among the links of each hop. Assuming Rayleigh fading and that all nodes are single-antenna devices, a comparative analysis between the selection strategies is performed in terms of the outage probability and average bit error rate. With this aim, closed-form expressions for the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and moment generating function of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived. Our theoretical results are validated by means of Monte Carlo simulations, and show that, irrespective on the metric analyzed, OPR always yields higher performance than SC.

Based on the proposed disaggregation framework, we use three advanced disaggregation algorithms, called committee decision mechanisms (CDMs), to perform load disaggregation at the metering level. Three random switching simulators are also developed to investigate the performance of different CDMs under a variety of scenarios. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that all CDMs outperform any single-feature, single-algorithm-based disaggregation methods. With sensitivity analysis, we also show that the CDMs are less sensitive to any load dynamics and noise.

Although each recording is represented by a second-order tensor (i.e., a matrix), a third-order tensor is needed to represent a music corpus. Non-negative multilinear principal component analysis (NMPCA) is proposed for the unsupervised dimensionality reduction of the third-order tensors. The NMPCA maximizes the total tensor scatter while preserving the non-negativity of auditory representations. An algorithm for NMPCA is derived by exploiting the structure of the Grassmann manifold. The NMPCA is compared against three multilinear subspace analysis techniques, namely the non-negative tensor factorization, the high-order singular value decomposition, and the multilinear principal component analysis as well as their linear counterparts, i.e., the non-negative matrix factorization, the singular value decomposition, and the principal components analysis in extracting features that are subsequently classified by either support vector machine or nearest neighbor classifiers. Three different sets of experiments conducted on the GTZAN and the ISMIR2004 Genre datasets demonstrate the superiority of NMPCA against the aforementioned subspace analysis techniques in extracting more discriminating features, especially when the training set has small cardinality. The best classification accuracies reported in the paper exceed those obtained by the state-of-the-art music genre classification algorithms applied to both datasets.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337979","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Tensile stress","Singular value decomposition","Feature

To improve sampling efficiency, it would be desirable, therefore, to be able to sample at a correspondingly time-varying rate while maintaining the ability to stably reconstruct the signal from its samples. Fourier theory is too rigid for this purpose but functional analytic tools have allowed a suitable generalization of Shannon sampling. Here, we add to this generalized sampling theory by constructing the corresponding time-varying prefilter.

The other is formed with three cascaded interferometers consisting of four asymmetric X-junction couplers and three Raman amplifiers. In both architectures, multiple signals at different wavelengths can be wavelength-selectively switched by pumping light in the waveguide-type Raman amplifiers. The wavelength range is found to be as wide as about 400 nm, which is ten times as wide as the range usable in the previously reported switch. The switching operation in the wide wavelength range is verified numerically. As a result, switching extinction ratio of larger than 20 dB is obtained for wavelength range from 1350 to 1750 nm. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5350899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2036450","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5350899/05337985.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"180","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2036450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Wavelength-Selective Switch Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers and Raman Amplifiers for Wide Wavelength Range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2010","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Wavelength-Selective Switch Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers and Raman Amplifiers for Wide Wavelength Range","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11147862","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Wavelength-Selective Switch Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers and Raman Amplifiers for Wide Wavelength Range","sourcePdf":"jlt-goto-2036450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.525529S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2010","isNumber":"5350899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5337985","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5337987,"authors":[{"name":"Tian-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tian-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954800"},{"name":"Hui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Automation, College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wen","id":"37667662200"},{"name":"Qing Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535151000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"5337987","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":924},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"Using mean value theorem and backstepping technique, a robust adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed for a class of pure-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown dead zone and disturbances via input-to-state stability.

Numerous detection schemes for SC and MC communication systems have been proposed. While these schemes may be derived from different principles, they usually rely on some initial estimate of the communication channel and/or the covariance matrix of the received signal. However, such estimates usually contain inherent estimation errors to which most existing detection schemes are known to be sensitive. In this paper, we develop robust estimation and detection schemes that explicitly account for channel and covariance matrix estimation errors by optimizing the worst-case performance over properly selected bounded uncertainty sets. Although the prior channel and covariance matrix-estimation errors are generally not bounded, we show that it is beneficial to refine the channel and covariance matrix estimates over properly chosen bounded uncertainty sets centered on the prior channel and covariance matrix estimates. Numerical results show that an improved performance is achieved by using the proposed robust approaches over the ones that ignore the prior estimation errors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2036854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05337993.pdf","endPage":"672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Channel Estimation and Detection for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2036854","startPage":"662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Channel Estimation and Detection for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337993/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11149572","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5337993/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Channel Estimation and Detection for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-amleh-2036854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5337993","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337994,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Woon Chong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5431116/5337994/5337994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jo Woon Chong received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2002, 2004, and 2009, respectively.","Since 2003, he has been a Teaching and Research Assistant with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST.

Two types of carrier-sensing errors, i.e., false alarm and miss-detection, are considered, and their impact on the system performance is analyzed using a new CSMA/CA model based on a Markov chain capturing the sensing error at the physical layer. The system throughput and delay as functions of the sensing error probabilities, as well as other CSMA/CA parameters, are obtained, and their sensitivity with respect to a key physical-layer parameter, i.e., the sensing threshold, is analyzed for commonly used energy detectors or matched filters. It is shown that the throughput and delay sensitivity heavily depends on the ratio of the contention window size W to the frame length L, and the throughput is sensitive to the design of the sensing threshold when the ratio W/L is either small or large. The result provides guidelines about how to operate CSMA/CA considering imperfect sensing at the physical layer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Performance Analysis for CSMA/CA Protocols: Impact of Imperfect Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2036927","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05337994.pdf","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2036927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5337994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Performance Analysis for CSMA/CA Protocols: Impact of Imperfect Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5337994/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177566","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Performance Analysis for CSMA/CA Protocols: Impact of Imperfect Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-sung-2036927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086202S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5337994","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5337995,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533619600"},{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675869900"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5337995","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"A generically applicable hybrid multiuser detector (MUD) concept is proposed by appropriately activating different MUDs in consecutive turbo iterations based on the mutual information (MI) gain.

In 2005, 2006, and 2008 the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) conducted four large-scale system-wide tests of the western interconnected power system where probing signals were injected by modulating the control signal at the Celilo end of the Pacific DC intertie. A major objective of these tests is the accurate estimation of the inter-area electromechanical modes. A key aspect of any such test is the design of an effective probing signal that leads to measured outputs rich in information about the modes. This paper specifically studies low-level probing signal design for power-system identification. The paper describes the design methodology and the advantages of this new probing signal which was successfully applied during these tests. This probing input is a multi-sine signal with its frequency content focused in the range of the inter-area modes. The period of the signal is over 2 min providing high-frequency resolution. Up to 15 cycles of the signal are injected resulting in a processing gain of 15. The resulting system response is studied in the time and frequency domains. Because of the new probing signal characteristics, these results show significant improvement in the output SNR compared to previous tests.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2033801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05338001.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2033801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probing Signal Design for Power System Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338001/","displayDocTitle":"Probing Signal Design for Power System Identification","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256802","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338001/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probing Signal Design for Power System Identification","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-pierre-2033801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.213677S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5338001","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5338003,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Memarian","affiliation":["Center for Integrated RF Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5338003/5338003-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Memarian (S'08) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1983.

A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338015/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11050001","pubMedId":"19923044","htmlLink":"/document/5338015/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"<emphasis emphasistype=\"mono\">elastix</emphasis>: A Toolbox for Intensity-Based Medical Image Registration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<emphasis emphasistype=\"mono\">elastix</emphasis>: A Toolbox for Intensity-Based Medical Image Registration","sourcePdf":"tmi-staring-2035616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129847S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5371922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"2153","xplore-issue":"5371922","articleId":"5338015","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5338017,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Vgenis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Vgenis","id":"37402754800"},{"name":"Constantinos S.

However, these techniques are developed in isolation, and generally, a single technique cannot address the diagnostic problems in complex systems. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach, which combines model-based and data-driven techniques to obtain better diagnostic performance than the use of a single technique alone, and demonstrate it on an antilock braking system. In this approach, we first combine the parity equations and a nonlinear observer to generate the residuals. Statistical tests, particularly the generalized likelihood ratio tests, are used to detect and isolate a subset of faults that are easier to detect. Support vector machines are used for fault isolation of less-sensitive parametric faults. Finally, subset selection (via fault detection and isolation) is used to accurately estimate fault severity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338018/","volume":"40","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5338018/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11138022","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Model-Based and Data-Driven Diagnosis of Automotive Antilock Braking Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Model-Based and Data-Driven Diagnosis of Automotive Antilock Braking Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmca-luo-2034481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152619S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5415834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5415834","articleId":"5338018","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5338019,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Santagiustina","affiliation":["CNIT Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Santagiustina","id":"37266801600"},{"name":"Luca Schenato","affiliation":["CNIT Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Schenato","id":"37265689800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5338019","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"A systematic study of the effects of polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) on broadband and narrowband single-pump fiber parametric amplifiers is realized through numerical solutions of the equations governing the interaction.

DSC refers to separate compression and joint decoding of correlated sources, which are taken as adjacent bands of a hyperspectral image. This concept is used to design a compression scheme that provides error resilience, very low complexity, and good compression performance. These features are obtained employing scalar coset codes to encode the current band at a rate that depends on its correlation with the previous band, without encoding the prediction error. Iterative decoding employs the decoded version of the previous band as side information and uses a cyclic redundancy code to verify correct reconstruction. We develop three algorithms based on this paradigm, which provide different tradeoffs between compression performance, error resilience, and complexity. Their performance is evaluated on raw and calibrated AVIRIS images and compared with several existing algorithms. Preliminary results of a field-programmable gate array implementation are also provided, which show that the proposed algorithms can sustain an extremely high throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2033470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5437362/05338026.pdf","startPage":"1892","endPage":"1904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2033470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Resilient and Low-Complexity Onboard Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Images by Means of Distributed Source Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Error-Resilient and Low-Complexity Onboard Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Images by Means of Distributed Source Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338026/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11204325","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338026/","volume":"48","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Resilient and Low-Complexity Onboard Lossless Compression of Hyperspectral Images by Means of Distributed Source Coding","sourcePdf":"tgrs-magli-2033470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094294S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5437362","articleId":"5338026","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5338028,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Demirel","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37338249900"},{"name":"Cagri Ozcinar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Surrey, UK","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cagri","lastName":"Ozcinar","id":"38229873700"},{"name":"Gholamreza Anbarjafari","affiliation":["Department of Information System Engineering, Cyprus International University, Lefkosa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Anbarjafari","id":"37596451000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5338028","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":171,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2885},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Satellites","Singular value decomposition","Histograms","Matrix decomposition","Brightness","Frequency estimation","Information systems","Image processing","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite image contrast enhancement","discrete wavelet transform","singular value decomposition","singular value matrix","low-low subband image","inverse DWT","histogram equalization","image equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform","image equalization","satellite image contrast enhancement"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new satellite image contrast enhancement technique based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition has been proposed.

In addition, effects of significant parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities need to be addressed carefully. In this paper, a discontinuous-projection-based adaptive robust controller that explicitly takes into account the dynamic coupling effect is developed for the high-performance contouring controls of linear-motor-driven high-speed/acceleration systems under various parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. Theoretically, the resulting controllers achieve certain guaranteed transient performance and steady-state tracking accuracy. In addition, asymptotic output tracking is achieved under parametric uncertainties only. Comparative experimental results are obtained for a linear-motor-driven biaxial high-speed industrial gantry. The results verify the excellent contouring performance of the proposed schemes, even in the presence of parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2032292","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5536924/05338034.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2032292","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","startPage":"728","endPage":"735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Controller Design for an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Controller Design for an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338034/","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5338034/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11450148","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Controller Design for an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry","sourcePdf":"tmech-yao-2032292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095639S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5536924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5536924","articleId":"5338034","onlineDate":"17 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5338054,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportional-integral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear AC current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the DC bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary frame controllers with back electromotive force compensation, stationary frame P+ resonant (PR) controllers, and synchronous \n<i

These nucleic acid molecules must satisfy several combinatorial, thermodynamic and secondary structure constraints, which aim to avoid undesired hybridizations and make the molecular experiment more reliable. In this paper, we formulate the DNA sequence design as a multiobjective optimization problem and solving it using implicit enumeration search approach. To heuristically search for good strand sets, our algorithm considers groups of solutions together. If any partial solution violates any constraint, all completion of this partial solution should be excluded from further consideration which accelerate the convergent of our algorithm. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is compared with other sequence design methods, and the results show that the implicit enumeration algorithm outperforms in DNA sequences quality, quantity and efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325022/5338059/05338080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General nucleic acid sequence design using implicit enumeration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequences","DNA","Algorithm design and analysis","Hamming distance","Thermodynamics","Medical diagnosis","RNA","Genetic algorithms","Biomedical engineering","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputing","lab-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nucleic acid sequence design","DNA sequences design","RNA sequences design","gene microarrays","gene chips","medical diagnostic","biomolecular computing","nucleic acid molecules","multiobjective optimization problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"General nucleic acid sequence design using implicit enumeration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338080/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979228","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General nucleic acid sequence design using implicit enumeration","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5338080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094279S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325022","isNumber":"5338059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325022","xplore-issue":"5338059","articleId":"5338080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5338097,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, LanZhou, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37536974500"},{"name":"Xiangfeng Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, LanZhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangfeng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37672988900"},{"name":"Weijuan Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, LanZhou, China"],"firstName":"Weijuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37675148500"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Lanzhou University of Technology, LanZhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293671200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3866-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3867-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5338097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Particle swarm optimization","Support vector machines","Chaotic communication","Support vector machine classification","Logistics","Quantum computing","Face recognition","Machine learning algorithms","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic particle swarm optimization","circle map","SVM training","face database"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338097","abstract":"Training SVM consumes large memory and computation time, but traditional methods can not overcome above shortcomings.

An external population is preserved to store the nondominated individuals during the evolution process. The shrink of the external population is achieved based on individuals' crowding distance sorting by descending order, which deleting the redundant individuals in the crowding area. An individual with relatively big crowding distance is selected as the global best to lead the particles evolving to the disperse region. The dominant relation between individuals is compared with the constraint Pareto dominance to embody the constraints without external parameters. The experiments of six standard unconstraint test problems illustrate that the new algorithm is competitive with NSGA-II and SPEA2 in terms of converging to the true Pareto front and maintaining the diversity of the population. The effectiveness of the algorithm for constraint problems is proved by solving three constraint test problems. Moreover, the best value ranges of mutation rate and inertia weight are analyzed by numerical experiments to guarantee the steady convergence of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338139","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338059","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325022/5338059/05338139.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exploratory study of sorting particle swarm optimizer for multiobjective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338139/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An exploratory study of sorting particle swarm optimizer for multiobjective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338139/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10979266","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exploratory study of sorting particle swarm optimizer for multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5338139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066729S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325022","isNumber":"5338059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325022","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5338059","articleId":"5338139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5338151,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Intelligent Computing, Ministry of Education, Dahan University of Technology, Dahan, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37307998800"},{"name":"Ling Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Intelligent Computing, Ministry of Education, Dahan University of Technology, Dahan, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Guo","id":"37670005200"},{"name":"Xianglian Xue","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Intelligent Computing, Ministry of Education, Dahan University of Technology, Dahan, China"],"firstName":"Xianglian","lastName":"Xue","id":"37669495600"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Wei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Intelligent Computing, Ministry of Education, Dahan University of Technology, Dahan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3866-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3867-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5338151","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"abstract":"A new image encryption algorithm based on DNA sequence addition operation is presented. First, a DNA sequence matrix is obtained by encoding the original image. Second, divide the DNA sequence matrix into some equal blocks and use DNA sequence addition operation to add these blocks. Thirdly, carry out DNA sequence complement operation for the result of added matrix by using two Logistic maps. At last, decoding the DNA sequence matrix from the third step, we will get the encrypted image. The simulation experimental results and security analysis show that our algorithm not only can get good encryption effect, but also can resist exhaustive attack, statistical attack and differential attack.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325022/5338059/05338151.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An image encryption algorithm based on DNA sequence addition operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","DNA","Sequences","Image coding","Logistics","Decoding","Analytical models","Security","Algorithm design and analysis","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputing","chaos","cryptography","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image encryption algorithm","DNA sequence addition operation","DNA sequence matrix","logistic maps"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An image encryption algorithm based on DNA sequence addition operation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979274","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An image encryption algorithm based on DNA sequence addition operation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5338151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063304S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325022","isNumber":"5338059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325022","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5338059","articleId":"5338151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5338162,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Wook Ahn","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang Wook","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37327969900"},{"name":"Hyun-Tae Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185781900"},{"name":"Yehoon Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yehoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406993600"},{"name":"Jinung An","affiliation":["Pragmatic Applied Robot Institute, Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinung","lastName":"An","id":"37286060100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3866-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3867-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5338162","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338162","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Genetic mutations","Paper technology","Robots","Diversity reception","Testing","Robustness","Stress","Sorting","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid evolutionary algorithm","multiobjective optimization problems","adaptive local search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","evolutionary algorithm","weighted fitness","local search","proximity","diversity"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm that efficiently solves multiobjective optimization problems. The idea is to bring the strength of adaptive local search (ALS) to bear upon the realm of multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The ALS is developed by harmonizing a weighted fitness policy with a restricted mutation: it applies mutation only to a set of superior individuals in accordance with the weighted fitness values. It economizes search time and efficiently traverses the problem space in the vicinity of the most-likely and least-crowded solutions. Thus, it helps achieve higher proximity and better diversity of nondominated solutions. Empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338162","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325022/5338059/05338162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979282","htmlLink":"/document/5338162/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5338162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06019S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325022","isNumber":"5338059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325022","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5338059","articleId":"5338162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5338294,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Yu.

In this method, an analytical expression of the time dependence is developed for the field unknowns inside conductors. And hence any time step can be used to stably solve the system of equations inside conductors. A matrix solution is involved in the analytical expression. It is efficiently obtained by the time-domain finite-element reduction-recovery method, the factorization cost of which is O(M), with M much less than the system matrix size N. The system of equations exterior to conductors is formed by a backward difference method, and hence is also unconditionally stable. The resultant system matrix is solved efficiently by an H-matrix based direct sparse solver, which is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art direct sparse solver. The system exterior to the conductors and that interior to the conductors are then solved by a staggered marching scheme, the convergence of which is theoretically proved. Applications to on-chip problems have demonstrated a time step that is three orders of magnitude larger than what is permitted by an explicit time-domain scheme, with fast CPU run time, modest memory consumption, and without sacrificing accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unconditionally stable time-domain finite element method of significantly reduced computational complexity for large-scale simulation of IC and package problems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 18th Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","doi":"10.1109/EPEPS.2009.5338457","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 18th Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325166/5338427/05338457.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPS.2009.5338457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An unconditionally stable time-domain finite element method of significantly reduced computational complexity for large-scale simulation of IC and package problems","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338457/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unconditionally stable time-domain finite element method of significantly reduced computational complexity for large-scale simulation of IC and package problems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067592S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325166","isNumber":"5338427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325166","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5338427","articleId":"5338457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5338462,"authors":[{"name":"Tapobrata Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Tapobrata","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37681035800"},{"name":"Ritwik Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ritwik","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37269211200"},{"name":"Daehyun Chung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Chung","id":"37289469400"},{"name":"Madhavan Swaminathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Madhavan","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37275519500"},{"name":"Rao Tummala","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rao","lastName":"Tummala","id":"37275355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4447-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5646-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"}],"articleNumber":"5338462","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Through-silicon vias","Voltage","Analytical models","Dielectric substrates","Parametric study","Dielectric losses","Channel bank filters","Temperature","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","integrated circuit modelling","MOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical modeling","co-axial TSV","voltage dependent metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitance","annular TSV","3D electromagnetic simulations","analytical modeling","depletion region","through silicon vias","MOS capacitance effects"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents analytical modeling and parametric study of the voltage dependent metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitance of annular and co-axial TSVs. 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulations of TSVs are performed considering the depletion region.

Extending the performance of these main memory systems beyond the current data rate is quite challengeable as the signal integrity issues with physical channel remains relatively constant compared to the device performance which improves as process advances. This paper presents three key technologies which help the current memory architecture to reach the data rates of 1600~3200 Mb/s without sacrificing memory capacity, increasing power consumption, or switching to more advanced differential signaling. These key features include FlexPhasetrade timing adjustment to eliminate trace length matching, dynamic point-to-point signaling to increase memory capacity at high data rates, and near ground signaling to reduce IO signaling power. This paper demonstrates the benefits of these features from signal and power integrity point of view.","doi":"10.1109/EPEPS.2009.5338468","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 18th Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 18th Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325166/5338427/05338468.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPS.2009.5338468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and solutions for next generation main memory systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338468/","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and solutions for next generation main memory systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338468/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and solutions for next generation main memory systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065084S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325166","isNumber":"5338427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325166","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5338427","articleId":"5338468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5338538,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Shalaby","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Comm., College of Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Shalaby","id":"37667547200"},{"name":"A.K.

A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure MMSE approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The PDAF and JPDAF algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how PDAF can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the PDAF/JPDAF illustrated in \"Real-World Applications of PDAF and JPDAF\" show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2009.934469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/5338531/05338565.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2009.934469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The probabilistic data association filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"The probabilistic data association filter","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985728","htmlLink":"/document/5338565/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The probabilistic data association filter","sourcePdf":"16-29mcs06-barshalom.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095447S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"5338531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"5338531","articleId":"5338565","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5338642,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew F.

While the cost and straightforward application of random testing are appealing, these benefits must be evaluated against the reduced effectiveness due to the generality of the approach. Recently, a number of novel techniques, coined Adaptive Random Testing, have sought to increase the effectiveness of random testing by attempting to maximize the testing coverage of the input domain. This paper presents the novel application of an evolutionary search algorithm to this problem. The results of an extensive simulation study are presented in which the evolutionary approach is compared against the Fixed Size Candidate Set (FSCS), Restricted Random Testing (RRT), quasi-random testing using the Sobol sequence (Sobol), and random testing (RT) methods. The evolutionary approach was found to be superior to FSCS, RRT, Sobol, and RT amongst block patterns, the arena in which FSCS, and RRT have demonstrated the most appreciable gains in testing effectiveness. The results among fault patterns with increased complexity were shown to be similar to those of FSCS, and RRT; and showed a modest improvement over Sobol, and RT. A comparison of the asymptotic and empirical runtimes of the evolutionary search algorithm, and the other testing approaches, was also considered, providing further evidence that the application of an evolutionary search algorithm is feasible, and within the same order of time complexity as the other adaptive random testing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11000744","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5338642/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Evolutionary Approach for Adaptive Random Testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Evolutionary Approach for Adaptive Random Testing","sourcePdf":"tr-tappenden-2034288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119428S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"5338641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5338641","articleId":"5338642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5338662,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, UMR CNRS, Marseilles, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5338656/5338662/5338662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad-Ali Khalighi (M'99, SM'07) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and his Ph.D. in electrical engineering (telecommunications) from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG), France, in 2002.

It is well known that the effect of turbulence can be reduced by performing aperture averaging and/or employing spatial diversity at the receiver. In this paper, we provide a synthesis on the effectiveness of these techniques under different atmospheric turbulence conditions from a telecommunication point of view. In particular, we quantify the performance improvement in terms of average bit error rate (BER) and outage capacity, which are among important parameters in practice. The efficiency of channel coding and the feasibility of exploiting time diversity in aperture averaging receivers are discussed as well. We also compare single- and multiple-aperture systems from the point of view of fading reduction by considering uncorrelated fading on adjacent apertures for the latter case. We show that when the receiver is background noise limited, the use of multiple apertures is largely preferred to a single large aperture under strong turbulence conditions. A single aperture is likely to be preferred under moderate turbulence conditions, however. When the receiver is thermal noise limited, even under strong turbulence conditions, the use of multiple apertures is interesting only when working at a very low BER. We also provide discussions on several practical issues related to system implementation.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.1.000580","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5338656/05338662.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.1.000580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fading Reduction by Aperture Averaging and Spatial Diversity in Optical Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fading Reduction by Aperture Averaging and Spatial Diversity in Optical Wireless Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338662/","publicationDate":"November 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10985489","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338662/","volume":"1","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fading Reduction by Aperture Averaging and Spatial Diversity in Optical Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11196S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5338656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5338656","articleId":"5338662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5338680,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The first contribution is the introduction of quasi-omnidirectional wrapped-microstrip antenna elements to be integrated into the display rim of laptops. Single- and dual-band antennas are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of wrapped microstrip antenna elements in wireless communications. The prototyping and measurements of these antennas are highlighted in an appendix. The most common internal and external laptop antenna structures are also described, to give a broader overview of laptop antenna-design approaches. The second and third contributions are a methodical analysis of housing effects, and a general study of electromagnetic human interaction with laptop antennas from the antenna-performance-degradation and user-illumination perspectives. These studies have been performed systematically for several classes of internal and external antennas, with different locations and screen-opening angles. With this approach, a general overview of laptop-antenna integration aspects is given, along with unified guidelines for the design of the wireless interface used in modern laptops. An application of the novel elements to capacity-preserving MIMO arrays is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985021","htmlLink":"/document/5338680/","displayDocTitle":"Wrapped Microstrip Antennas for Laptop Computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wrapped Microstrip Antennas for Laptop Computers","sourcePdf":"0011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108527S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5338669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5338669","articleId":"5338680","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5338683,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These fundamental limits are of the utmost importance, since the minimum size needed to achieve a particular figure of merit can be determined from them.

Additionally, the use of antenna miniaturization techniques to approach these limits is discussed. Using a spiral antenna as an example, guidelines are presented for miniaturizing UWB antennas.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2009.5338684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5338669/05338684.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5338684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","startPage":"57","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits and Design Guidelines for Miniaturizing Ultra-Wideband Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits and Design Guidelines for Miniaturizing Ultra-Wideband Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338684/","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5338684/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985022","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits and Design Guidelines for Miniaturizing Ultra-Wideband Antennas","sourcePdf":"0015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129345S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5338669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5338669","articleId":"5338684","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5338685,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hsun Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/5338669/5338685/5338685-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Hsu Hsu received the BSEE degree from National Cheng-Kung University, Taiwan; the MS degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and the PhD degree from Texas A & M University at College Station; in 2000, 2004, and 2008, respectively.

The event driven analog modeling approach uses the double precision data type wreal (supported by VerilogAMS), that enables analog accuracy in the digital simulation domain. It is therefore possible to separate high frequency signal paths in the frequency synthesizers from the analog domain, in order to archive higher simulation efficiency for fast verification purposes. The modeling approach and an investigation of the necessary accuracy requirements for the verification including phase noise performances of the analog frequency synthesizers is presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated on baseof a sub micron CMOS Fractional-N frequency synthesizer and compared with different traditional modeling approaches, like phase model and pure digital model. The paper concludes with a proposal of a verification approach for RF mixed signal systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event driven analog modeling for the verification of PLL frequency synthesizers","doi":"10.1109/BMAS.2009.5338892","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335440/5338873/05338892.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","startPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMAS.2009.5338892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Frequency synthesizers","Semiconductor device modeling","Analog circuits","Phase noise","Radio frequency","Discrete event simulation","Hardware design languages","Testing","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","frequency synthesizers","hardware description languages","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven analog modeling","PLL frequency synthesizers","complex analog frequency synthesizers","double precision data type wreal","VerilogAMS","digital simulation domain","sub micron CMOS fractional-N frequency synthesizer","RF mixed signal systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling","VerilogAMS","wreal","verification","phase noise","accuracy requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Event driven analog modeling for the verification of PLL frequency synthesizers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338892/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"17-18 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985435","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event driven analog modeling for the verification of PLL frequency synthesizers","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058239S","chronDate":"17-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335440","isNumber":"5338873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335440","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5338873","articleId":"5338892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5338905,"authors":[{"name":"Dhananjay Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Dhananjay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37306688400"},{"name":"S.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) employing adaptive channel allocation technique can support these requirement while increasing the system capacity many fold. Here, an efficient resource allocation method called two stage rate adaptive (TSRA) algorithm is proposed in order to meet dynamic bandwidth requirement in downlink. We model the resource allocation problem with goal of maximizing spectral efficiency. Considering random mix of four categories of multimedia traffic, we find that gap between analytical and simulated average capacity of the system gets smaller as number of user increases and at one point the simulated average system capacity exceeds 6 b/s per Hz. Further, other system parameters like average throughput, delay and BER of the TSRA protocol is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic resource management for downlink multimedia traffic in OFDMA cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2009 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Innovations for Digital Inclusions","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Innovations for Digital Inclusions","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331934/5338868/05338905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5338905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resource management for downlink multimedia traffic in OFDMA cellular networks","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5338905/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985384","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resource management for downlink multimedia traffic in OFDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"S52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068146S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331934","isNumber":"5338868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331934","xplore-issue":"5338868","articleId":"5338905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ITU","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5338938,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Parri","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Research Group SITE, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Parri","id":"37681271600"},{"name":"Saurabh Ratti","affiliation":["Discover Laboratory SITE, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Ratti","id":"37394173700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4752-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4751-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5338938","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed-Forward Back-Propogation Neural Network","Configurable","Coprocessor","Function Approximation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Both conventional desktop and embedded processors rely on lookup tables (LUT) and iterative interpolation/regression methods to evaluate trigonometric functions.

CR networks inevitably lead to complex and sophisticated interference scenarios. This has inspired our investigation on applying IC techniques to CR networks with a special focus on mitigating the internetwork interference. We have found that a CR receiver assisted by proper IC techniques can effectively combat interference from primary networks, given that the secondary signals have dissimilar characteristics to those of primary signals. In addition, various IC techniques have been found to be useful for CR transmitters to rigidly control their emission patterns and thereby mitigate the interference caused to primary systems. Moreover, we have shown that hybrid IC schemes can be obtained by combining simple IC techniques. Our investigations have suggested that the performance of CR networks can be significantly improved by using IC technologies.","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2009.934672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10209/5338983/05338998.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2009.934672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5338998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio networks","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10993007","htmlLink":"/document/5338998/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"76-84-04mvt04-hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044704S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"5338983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5338983","articleId":"5338998","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339013,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihong Zeng","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274114600"},{"name":"Tianhong Fang","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Tianhong","lastName":"Fang","id":"37678570200"},{"name":"Shishir Shah","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Shishir","lastName":"Shah","id":"37288747500"},{"name":"Ioannis A.

To create a secure system, we must evaluate the possibility of wolf attacks. Existing studies have relied on theoretical analysis of algorithms carried out by human beings, which is only effective if theoretical analysis is possible. Therefore, we propose a more generic approach based on a search to assist the developers of matching algorithms. We searched for wolves by using a recently developed algorithm called Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We succeeded in detecting wolves in a matching algorithm, which appears promising considering that this is the first trial for this kind of approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339016/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046396","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A study on security evaluation methodology for image-based biometrics authentication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on security evaluation methodology for image-based biometrics authentication systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053371S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5339025,"authors":[{"name":"Yui Man Lui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Yui Man","lastName":"Lui","id":"38262644300"},{"name":"David Bolme","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Bolme","id":"37541345700"},{"name":"Bruce A.

Our review of the literature found six covariates for which multiple studies reported effects on face recognition performance. These are: age of the person, elapsed time between images, gender of the person, the person's expression, the resolution of the face images, and the race of the person. The results presented are drawn from 25 studies conducted over the past 12 years. There is near complete agreement between all of the studies that older people are easier to recognize than younger people, and recognition performance begins to degrade when images are taken more than a year apart. While individual studies find men or women easier to recognize, there is no consistent gender effect. There is universal agreement that changing expression hurts recognition performance. If forced to compare different expressions, there is still insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular expression is better than another. Higher resolution images improve performance for many modern algorithms. Finally, given the studies summarized here, no clear conclusions can be drawn about whether one racial group is harder or easier to recognize than another.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325482/5339005/05339025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A meta-analysis of face recognition covariates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Image resolution","Image quality","Lighting","Degradation","Glass","Pixel","Eyes","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","face recognition","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meta-analysis","face recognition covariates","recognition performance","face expressions","higher resolution images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A meta-analysis of face recognition covariates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339025/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046405","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A meta-analysis of face recognition covariates","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111994S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5339026,"authors":[{"name":"Yui Man Lui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Yui Man","lastName":"Lui","id":"38262644300"},{"name":"J.

Previous methods employ illumination models to create a projector from an illumination basis and perform single image classification. In contrast, we apply an illumination model to an image and create a set of illumination variants. For a gallery image, these variants are expressed as a point on a Stiefel manifold with an associated tangent plane. Two projections of the probe image illumination variants onto this tangent plane are defined and the ratio between these two projections, called the Canonical Stiefel Quotient (CSQ), is a measure of distance between images. We show that the proposed CSQ paradigm not only outperforms the traditional single image matching approach but also other variants of image set matching including a geodesic method. Furthermore, the proposed CSQ method is robust to the choice of training sets. Finally, our analyses reveal the benefits of using image set classification over single image matching.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339026","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325482/5339005/05339026.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Canonical Stiefel Quotient and its application to generic face recognition in illumination spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339026/","displayDocTitle":"Canonical Stiefel Quotient and its application to generic face recognition in illumination spaces","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046406","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339026/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical Stiefel Quotient and its application to generic face recognition in illumination spaces","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106613S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339041,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc-Son Vu","affiliation":["Vesalis company, Parc Technologique de la Pardieu, 10 rue Evariste Galois, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France"],"firstName":"Ngoc-Son","lastName":"Vu","id":"37391309700"},{"name":"Alice Caplier","affiliation":["Signal and Images Department, GIPSA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Caplier","id":"37266382200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5019-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5020-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339041","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"abstract":"The performance of face recognition systems can be dramatically degraded when the pose of the probe face is different from the gallery face. In this paper, we present a pose robust face recognition model, centered on modeling how face patches change in appearance as the viewpoint varies. We present a novel model based on two robust local appearance descriptors, Gabor wavelets and local binary patterns (LBP). These two descriptors have been widely exploited for face recognition and different strategies for combining them have been investigated. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing combination methods are designed for frontal face recognition. We introduce a local statistical framework for face recognition across pose variations, given only one frontal reference image. The method is evaluated on the Feret pose dataset and experimental results show that we achieve very high recognition rates over the wide range of pose variations presented in this challenging dataset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325482/5339005/05339041.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient statistical face recognition across pose using Local Binary Patterns and Gabor wavelets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Probes","Robustness","Lighting","Degradation","Design methodology","Bayesian methods","Statistical analysis","Computational complexity","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","filtering theory","statistical analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical face recognition system","LBP","local binary pattern","Gabor wavelet","pose robust face recognition model","robust local appearance descriptor","frontal reference image","Feret pose dataset","retina filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient statistical face recognition across pose using Local Binary Patterns and Gabor wavelets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339041/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979906","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient statistical face recognition across pose using Local Binary Patterns and Gabor wavelets","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058911S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5339045,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.C.

To mitigate these risks, solutions such as the helper-data system, fuzzy vault, fuzzy extractors, and cancelable biometrics were introduced, also known as the field of template protection. In parallel to these developments, fusion of multiple sources of biometric information have shown to improve the verification performance of the biometric system. In this work we analyze fusion of the protected template from two 3D recognition algorithms (multi-algorithm fusion) at feature-, score-, and decision-level. We show that fusion can be applied at the known fusion-levels with the template protection technique known as the Helper-Data System. We also illustrate the required changes of the helper-data system and its corresponding limitations. Furthermore, our experimental results, based on 3D face range images of the FRGC v2 dataset, show that indeed fusion improves the verification performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-algorithm fusion with template protection","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339045","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325482/5339005/05339045.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-algorithm fusion with template protection","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339045/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-algorithm fusion with template protection","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071771S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339049,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Tahmoush","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Tahmoush","id":"37396489800"},{"name":"Jerry Silvious","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Silvious","id":"37396490200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5019-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5020-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339049","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Doppler radar","Biometrics","Radar scattering","Radar polarimetry","Radar imaging","Feature extraction","Independent component analysis","Data mining","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","Doppler radar","feature extraction","gait analysis","probability","radar applications","radar clutter","radar detection","radar tracking","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar microDoppler signal extraction algorithm","long range front-view gait recognition","human motion","radar biometric feature","gait feature detection","gait feature tracking","gait feature extraction","low-clutter background","classification probability","video signal","GPS"]}],"abstract":"We seek to understand the extraction of radar micro-Doppler signals generated by human motions at long range and with a front-view to use them as a biometric.

In practical applications, one or both of the samples may be of degraded quality, in respect to the nominal quality of similar samples acquired in controlled conditions. It has been shown in prior art that in such situations, the integration of quality information into the process of bio-metric matching can lead to significantly improved classification performance of the biometric matcher. To facilitate such an integration, quality measures originating from both compared biometric samples are usually combined into one quality score. In this paper, we analyze the merit of doing so. We revisit the problem from a pattern classification perspective, and show that using individual quality measures as separate classification features frequently leads to a superior performance of a biometric system in comparison with the system in which quality measures are mapped into one quality score. We provide experimental support of this claim using synthetic data, as well as real biometric database, on the examples of face, fingerprint and multi-modal matching.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339054","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325482/5339005/05339054.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of combining quality measures on biometric sample matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of combining quality measures on biometric sample matching","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339054/","accessionNumber":"10979916","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339054/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of combining quality measures on biometric sample matching","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054834S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325482","isNumber":"5339005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325482","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5339005","articleId":"5339054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5339068,"authors":[{"name":"Unsang Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Unsang","lastName":"Park","id":"37400212000"},{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ross","id":"37271231600"},{"name":"Anil K.

Besides having asymptotically optimal cardinality and zero autocorrelation sidelobes, these multilevel prime codes can be partitioned into a tree structure of multiple levels of subsets of code matrices. In each level, the number of subsets, the number of code matrices per subset, and the cross-correlation function of each subset are related to the level number. The performance of the new codes in an optical code-division multiple-access system with hard-limiting detection is analyzed. Our results show that the unique partition property of the multilevel prime codes supports a trade-off between code cardinality and performance for meeting different system requirements, such as user capacity and throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5353239/05339088.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"607","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.1.000600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.1.000600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Prime Codes for Optical CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Tree data structures","Autocorrelation","Performance analysis","Optimized production technology","Throughput","Galois fields","Two dimensional displays","Interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel coding","Optical code division multiple access","Variable performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Prime Codes for Optical CDMA Systems","volume":"1","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5339088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Prime Codes for Optical CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063413S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5353239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5353239","articleId":"5339088","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5339091,"authors":[{"name":"Judith Liu-Jimenez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5695105/5339091/5339091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Judith Liu-Jimenez (S'07) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2003.

This paper provides solutions to designing such personal tokens where biometric authentication is required.

A newly developed quad bitline architecture, which combines folded bitline configuration with shield bitline scheme, eliminates bitline-bitline (BL-BL) coupling noise. The quad bitline architecture also reduces the number of sense amplifiers and activated bitlines, resulting in the reduction of die size by 6.5% and cell array power consumption by 28%.

A frequency-domain approach is adopted to avoid high sampling rate in time. Specifically, the proposed system obtains the discrete spectra of input impulses first; then realizes time-reversal in frequency domain; and finally synthesizes the time-reversed impulses using discrete continuous wave elements. This system is composed of common and commercially available circuits, and hence, can embody a system-on-chip implementation. Its performance is verified by circuit-electromagnetic co-simulations using impulses with 3-10-GHz frequency band coverage. Advanced Design System and two full-wave Maxwell's equations solvers are used for circuit and electromagnetic simulations, respectively, and their results are coupled and integrated. In the circuit part, most of nonidealities of realistic circuits are taken into account. It is shown by the simulation results that, although realistic circuits unavoidably introduce errors to time-reversal, such errors do not affect the \u00bffocusing\u00bf phenomena in the context of electromagnetic wave propagation. As a conclusion, the proposed system can be deployed in practical time-reversal communication and radar applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339101/","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5339101/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11054517","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Electronic Circuit System for Time-Reversal of Ultra-Wideband Short Impulses Based on Frequency-Domain Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electronic Circuit System for Time-Reversal of Ultra-Wideband Short Impulses Based on Frequency-Domain Approach","sourcePdf":"58tmtt01-hzhai-2035883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139583S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5379166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5379166","articleId":"5339101","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5339102,"authors":[{"name":"Cemin Zhang","affiliation":["Hittite Microwave Corporation, Chelmsford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5379166/5339102/5339102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cemin Zhang was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in 1978.

reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. However, different precoding schemes will increase error probabilities of the system. With the knowledge of the channel information and the receiver filter, we derive a necessary condition on the chosen precoding matrices for minimizing error probability of the OFDM system in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. A systematic procedure in designing such an optimal precoding matrix is provided. With a proper selection, the optimal precoding matrix can meet the requirements of PAPR reduction and achieve the minimum error probability in white Gaussian noise. Our simulation results show that the chosen precoding matrix notably outperforms other general precoding matrices in both AWGN and multipath fading channels. We also proved that the precoding matrix with all the singular values equal to 1 is one of the optimal solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2034512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5419214/05339108.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2034512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimum Error Probability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339108/","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimum Error Probability","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11154874","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339108/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimum Error Probability","sourcePdf":"tbc-hao-2034512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063584S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5419214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5419214","articleId":"5339108","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5339109,"authors":[{"name":"Hongseok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5484926/5339109/5339109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongseok Kim (S'06\u2013M'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2009.","From 2000 to 2005, he was a Member of Technical Staff at Korea Telecom Network Laboratory.

This is particularly effective when a wireless system is underloaded as the degradation in user's perceived quality of service can be negligible. The challenge, however, is developing a mechanism that achieves a good tradeoff among transmit power, idling/circuit power, and the performance customers will see. We consider systems with flow-level dynamics supporting either real-time or best effort (e.g., file transfers) sessions. The energy-optimal transmission strategy for real-time sessions is determined by solving a convex optimization. An iterative approach exhibiting superlinear convergence achieves substantial amount energy savings, e.g., more than 50% when the session blocking probability is 0.1% or less. The case of file transfers is more subtle because power backoff changes the system dynamics. We study energy-efficient transmission strategies that realize energy-delay tradeoff. The proposed mechanism achieves a 35%-75% in energy savings depending on the load and file transfer target throughput.

In such systems, most of the energy is consumed when the radios are on, waiting for a packet to arrive. Sleep-wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to prolong the lifetime of these energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, sleep-wake scheduling could result in substantial delays because a transmitting node needs to wait for its next-hop relay node to wake up. An interesting line of work attempts to reduce these delays by developing \u00bfanycast\u00bf-based packet forwarding schemes, where each node opportunistically forwards a packet to the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes. In this paper, we first study how to optimize the anycast forwarding schemes for minimizing the expected packet-delivery delays from the sensor nodes to the sink. Based on this result, we then provide a solution to the joint control problem of how to optimally control the system parameters of the sleep-wake scheduling protocol and the anycast packet-forwarding protocol to maximize the network lifetime, subject to a constraint on the expected end-to-end packet-delivery delay. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can outperform prior heuristic solutions in the literature, especially under practical scenarios where there are obstructions, e.g., a lake or a mountain, in the coverage area of the wireless sensor network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228765","htmlLink":"/document/5339116/","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Delay and Maximizing Lifetime for Wireless Sensor Networks With Anycast","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Delay and Maximizing Lifetime for Wireless Sensor Networks With Anycast","sourcePdf":"tnet-kim-2032294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168999S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5446467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5446467","articleId":"5339116","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339117,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio de Miguel","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory, Communications and Telematics Engineering, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5353239/5339117/5339117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ignacio de Miguel received his Telecommunication Engineer degree in 1997 and his Ph.D. degree in 2002, both from the University of Valladolid, Spain.

Hence, efficient dimensioning (i.e., determining each link capacity) and control methods are required to operate these networks. Typically, the dimensioning of WDM networks is carried out only after the routing algorithm has been defined. However, this way of designing the network might result in inefficient solutions in terms of wavelength requirements. We propose a novel genetic algorithm to solve the joint routing and dimensioning problem in dynamic WDM networks, with the aim of obtaining a network cost close to minimum while guaranteeing an upper bound on the blocking probability. Used prior to network operation, the algorithm determines which route should be used for each potential connection and also dimensions the number of wavelengths required in each link. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated in ring and mesh topologies, providing wavelength savings of up to 17% when compared with the best existing algorithm to date. Moreover, since the routes provided by the genetic algorithm are stored in routing tables, it also ensures extremely fast on-line network operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5339117/","publicationDate":"December 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Joint Routing and Dimensioning of Dynamic WDM Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm for Joint Routing and Dimensioning of Dynamic WDM Networks","sourcePdf":"608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134856S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5353239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5353239","articleId":"5339117","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339118,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Wei","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["\nXiaolin K.

A better understanding of the perception-action loop employed by athletes is necessary. This requires isolating contributing factors to determine their role in player performance. Because of its inherent limitations, video playback doesn't permit such in-depth analysis. Interactive, immersive virtual reality (VR) can overcome these limitations and foster a better understanding of sports performance from a behavioral-neuroscience perspective. Two case studies using VR technology and a sophisticated animation engine demonstrate how to use information from visual displays to inform a player's future course of action.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2010","publicationDate":"March-April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339124/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11152693","pubMedId":"20650707","volume":"30","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using Virtual Reality to Analyze Sports Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Virtual Reality to Analyze Sports Performance","sourcePdf":"mcg2010020014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062665S","chronDate":"March-April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"38","isNumber":"5420351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5420351","articleId":"5339124","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5339126,"authors":[{"name":"William Robinson","affiliation":["Georgia State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["William N.

Two of them use uniform sampling procedures with high and low sampling rates, respectively. The other two employ groups of samples, which are separated by long intergroup delays such that the intergroup correlations are negligible. One of the group-sampling schemes also employs optimal signaling waveforms to further improve its energy-efficiency. In all the schemes, data sampling and transformation are designed in such a way that Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) can still be implemented. The performances of different schemes, in terms of average termination time (ATT), are derived analytically. When all the schemes employ the same sampling interval and under a constant signal amplitude constraint, their performances are compared through analytical and numerical methods. In addition, under a constant power constraint, their ATTs and energy-efficiency are compared. It is theoretically proved that the scheme using groups of samples with the optimal signaling waveform is the most energy-efficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling

Beamforming for Wireless Sensor Networks With Improved Graph Connectivity and Energy Efficiency","abstract":"As the nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are independent units, an intensive communication among them is required to generate a common signal and synchronize before entering a distributed beamforming (DBF) phase. Therefore, it is crucial to select the participating nodes in DBF such that not only the resulting beampattern meets the beamforming design requirements but also the internode connectivity is retained. We consider a DBF technique for WSNs with uniformly distributed nodes and derive an average beampattern expression for a general scenario wherein the participating nodes in DBF are located on a ring with arbitrary inner and outer radii. It is proved that increasing the ring inner radius from zero to a value close to the ring outer radius, the width of the average beampattern mainlobe continuously decreases. Further, it is shown that selecting the nodes from a neighborhood close to a disc perimeter, that is, choosing the nodes from the narrow ring adjacent to the inner side of the disc boundary, facilitates a substantial decrease in the network energy waste and the node isolation probability compared to the case that the nodes are randomly selected from the whole disc. A simple approximate expression for the average beampattern is obtained in the case where the nodes are selected from a narrow ring and is used to derive the sidelobes' null and peak positions as well as a tight lower bound on the average beampattern directivity. The proposed technique is then extended to the case where the nodes are located on multiple concentric rings and the set of rings' radii are derived that guarantee an average beampattern null at a required position while substantially decreasing the sidelobe peak levels compared to the single-ring case. Finally, an average beampattern expression is obtained in the case that the nodes' signals are contaminated by noise to show that most properties of the average beampattern in the noise-free signal case carry over to the noisy signal scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","volume":"58","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11105832","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming for Wireless Sensor Networks With Improved Graph Connectivity and Energy Efficiency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming for Wireless Sensor Networks With Improved Graph Connectivity and Energy Efficiency","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-kzarifi-2037065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068291S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","articleId":"5339143","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339145,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel W.

In this paper, synchronization detection in the presence of interference for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is discussed. Here, synchronization indicates signal acquisition and timing estimation at the receiver, and is formulated as a binary statistical hypothesis test. Transmit sequences from multiple antennas are received by multiple antennas in noisy environments with spatially correlated noise (interference). Flat-fading and frequency-selective channel models for both the interference and signal of interest are considered. By applying well-known multiple antenna approaches to the MIMO synchronization problem, a number of new synchronization test statistics are introduced. These test statistics are motivated by minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) beamformers, generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT), least-squared (LS) channel estimation, and spatial invariance. Test statistics appropriate for orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems are considered, including test statistics that take advantage of cyclic prefixes and of pilot sequences within an OFDM symbol. Performances of various test statistics in terms of probability of missing detection for some probability of a false detection are shown to vary by multiple orders of magnitude in the presence of interference.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2037067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05339145.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2037067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","startPage":"1794","endPage":"1806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Synchronization of MIMO Wireless Communication in the Presence of Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Synchronization of MIMO Wireless Communication in the Presence of Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136153","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5339145/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Synchronization of MIMO Wireless Communication in the Presence of Interference","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-dbliss-2037067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122444S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5339145","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5339150,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sjodin","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Sjodin","id":"37409229100"},{"name":"Pontus Johannisson","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pontus","lastName":"Johannisson","id":"37326698800"},{"name":"Magnus Karlsson","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Karlsson","id":"37267658300"},{"name":"Zhi Tong","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Tong","id":"37398715800"},{"name":"Peter A.

In general, a major drawback of such nonlinear filters is the large number of parameters. Thus, a weak excitation of higher-order kernels results in a slow convergence for system identification tasks. In order to exploit the available innovation of the signals more effectively, each data frame is processed for a specified number of iterations in an overlap-save scheme, thereby enhancing the convergence performance. Due to inherent recursions of the repeated filtering and updating steps, this concept also lends itself to a fast algorithm, requiring only a moderate increase in algorithmic complexity over a baseline implementation. A detailed comparison of the required number of multiplications is given for several different algorithm versions. Despite the relatively simple concept, the outlined iteration algorithm exhibits significant gains in both adaptation speed and steady-state convergence. This is demonstrated by various experiments for both stationary noise and speech input considering an application of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation. Finally, investigations on the tracking behavior for time-variant nonlinearities and robustness against misdetection of double-talk situations confirm the promising benefits and good trade-off of the proposed iterated coefficient updates Volterra filters approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105823","htmlLink":"/document/5339156/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Adaptation of DFT-Domain Volterra Filters in Diagonal Coordinates Using Iterated Coefficient Updates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Adaptation of DFT-Domain Volterra Filters in Diagonal Coordinates Using Iterated Coefficient Updates","sourcePdf":"tsp-zeller-2037073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114996S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5339156","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339157,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5339157/5339157-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Zhang was born in China in 1981.

Thus, symptom monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patient and clinical staff alike, also hindering recruitment for future large-scale clinical trials. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial). These findings support the feasibility of frequent, remote, and accurate UPDRS tracking. This technology could play a key part in telemonitoring frameworks that enable large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2036000","startPage":"884","endPage":"893","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/05339170.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2036000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease Progression by Noninvasive Speech Tests","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parkinson's disease","Speech","Testing","Recruitment","Large-scale systems","Clinical trials","Signal processing algorithms","Regression tree analysis","Patient monitoring","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","feature extraction","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","patient treatment","regression analysis","speech","telemedicine","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telemonitoring","Parkinson disease symptom progression","noninvasive speech tests","Parkinson disease rating scale","time-consuming physical examinations","symptom monitoring","remote replication","signal processing algorithms","feature extraction","parsimonious model","robust feature selection algorithm","linear regression technique","nonlinear regression technique","classical least squares","nonparametric classification","regression trees","multicenter trial","UPDRS tracking","PD treatments","time 6 month"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["At-home testing device","classification and regression trees (CARTs)","speech signal processing","telemedicine","unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (UPDRS)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Disease Progression","Dysphonia","Female","Humans","Internet","Least-Squares Analysis","Male","Monitoring, Physiologic","Parkinson Disease","Regression Analysis","Reproducibility of Results","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Speech","Telemetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease Progression by Noninvasive Speech Tests","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5339170/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11206202","pubMedId":"19932995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease Progression by Noninvasive Speech Tests","sourcePdf":"tbme-tsanas-2036000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102494S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"317","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"5339170","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5339172,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The fundamental period contains information that is indicative of the physiological condition of the fetus such as hypoxia and acidemia. Our method is based on the minimization of a cost function that measures the differences between the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the fetal ECG waveform and the DFTs of its circularly shifted forms. By using the linear phase shift property of the DFT, we show that the minimization of this cost function is equivalent to finding the cosine waveform that matches best to the ECG power spectrum. The optimal cosine waveform is then used to estimate the fundamental period. We expand this method and discuss estimation of the fundamental period with subsample precision. Subsample estimates may be useful especially when a low sampling rate is used for a long period of monitoring. Comparison of performance of this method with Cepstrum and average magnitude difference function methods shows that our approach achieves very accurate period estimation results for both simulated and real fetal EGC waveforms that are taken at different stages of the gestation under noisy conditions. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2036597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/05339177.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"883","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2036597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Subsample Fetal Heart Rate Estimation Under Noisy Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Subsample Fetal Heart Rate Estimation Under Noisy Conditions","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5339177/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206210","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","pubMedId":"19932991","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Subsample Fetal Heart Rate Estimation Under Noisy Conditions","sourcePdf":"tbme-sahin-2036597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078666S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"5339177","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5339178,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Science Technology, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, South-East University, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Centre de Recherche en Information Biom\u00e9dicale Sino-Fran\u00e7ais (CRIBs), Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5415751/5339178/5339178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Zhang was born in 1981.

The system is capable of collecting data from 3 to 6 GHz, with 24 coresident antenna elements connected to a vector network analyzer via a 2 \u00d7 24 port matrix switch. As one of the major sources of error in the data collection process is a result of the strongly coupling 24 coresident antennas, we provide a novel method to avoid the frequencies where the coupling is large enough to prevent successful imaging. Through the use of two different nonlinear reconstruction schemes, which are an enhanced version of the distorted born iterative method and the multiplicative regularized contrast source inversion method, we show imaging results from dielectric phantoms in free space. The early inversion results show that with the frequency selection procedure applied, the system is capable of quantitatively reconstructing dielectric objects, and show that the use of the wideband data improves the inversion results over single-frequency data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband Microwave Tomography System With a Novel Frequency Selection Procedure","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2036372","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/05339180.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2036372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Microwave Tomography System With a Novel Frequency Selection Procedure","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5339180/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206205","pubMedId":"19932993","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Microwave Tomography System With a Novel Frequency Selection Procedure","sourcePdf":"tbme-gilmore-2036372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112621S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"5339180","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5339190,"authors":[{"name":"Xiannuan Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5339190/5339190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiannuan Liang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, both in mathematics.

We assume that coalition seeking has an investment cost and that the formation of a coalition determines the outcomes of parities, with the detect length of a coalition simply being the sum of those of separate coalition members.

Two different implementations are considered: a nonlinear-model-based MTPA profile including saturation and cross-saturation effects and a technique based on the maximization of the motor input power versus stator current. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the torque evolution during a transient under an MTPA control strategy on motors with different characteristics. Useful modifications of the current loop are suggested to improve the drive performance. The effects of the torque transient on the sensorless rotor position estimation are also taken into consideration, in case a sensorless MTPA implementation is required. Experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, showing the benefits of the new control schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5393147/05339202.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2036665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2036665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-State and Transient Operation of IPMSMs Under Maximum-Torque-per-Ampere Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Synchronous motors","Stators","Reluctance motors","Torque control","Sensorless control","Machine vector control","Transient analysis","Industry Applications Society","Materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors","IPMSM","maximum-torque-per-ampere vector control","nonlinear-model-based MTPA profile","cross-saturation effects","torque transient","sensorless rotor position estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Efficiency","losses","minimum search algorithms","power optimization","sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Steady-State and Transient Operation of IPMSMs Under Maximum-Torque-per-Ampere Control","volume":"46","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5339202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071309","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-State and Transient Operation of IPMSMs Under Maximum-Torque-per-Ampere Control","sourcePdf":"tia-consoli-2036665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061602S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5393147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5393147","articleId":"5339202","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5339203,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Hee Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","Caterpillar, Inc., Peoria, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5393147/5339203/5339203-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seok-Hee Han (M'07) was born in Seoul, Korea.

In particular, this paper addresses the retention of visual features in the field of view of the camera, which is an important robustness issue in visual servoing. First, the classical approach of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) for fixed-base manipulators is extended to WMRs and a control law with Lyapunov stability is determined. Second, in order to guarantee visibility of visual features, an innovative controller with machine learning using Q-learning is proposed, which can learn its behavior policy and autonomously improve its performance. Third, a hybrid controller for robust mobile manipulation is developed to integrate the IBVS controller and the Q-learning controller through a rule-based arbitrator. This is thought to be the first paper that integrates reinforcement learning or Q-learning with visual servoing to achieve robust operation. Experiments are carried out to validate the approaches developed in this paper. The experimental results show that the new hybrid controller developed here possesses the capabilities of self-learning and fast response, and provides a balanced performance with respect to robustness and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5339206/","accessionNumber":"11450155","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Visual Servo Controller for Robust Grasping by Wheeled Mobile Robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Visual Servo Controller for Robust Grasping by Wheeled Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2034740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076232S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5536924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5536924","articleId":"5339206","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5339210,"authors":[{"name":"Priyam Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5431097/5339210/5339210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Priyam Chatterjee (S'07) received the B.Tech. degree in Information technology from the University of Kalyani, India, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Yet researchers continue to focus attention on it to better the current state-of-the-art. Recently proposed methods take different approaches to the problem and yet their denoising performances are comparable. A pertinent question then to ask is whether there is a theoretical limit to denoising performance and, more importantly, are we there yet? As camera manufacturers continue to pack increasing numbers of pixels per unit area, an increase in noise sensitivity manifests itself in the form of a noisier image. We study the performance bounds for the image denoising problem. Our work in this paper estimates a lower bound on the mean squared error of the denoised result and compares the performance of current state-of-the-art denoising methods with this bound.

By using the CSS system, the distances between a mobile robot and CSS nodes fixed at known coordinates can be measured according to the time of flight of radio frequency signals. Based on the measured distances, the coordinates of a mobile robot can be calculated by the method of trilateration. To deal with measurement noise, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be applied to estimate the coordinate of the mobile robot. These measured distances, however, are not only noisy but also biased. Therefore, the estimated coordinates of the mobile robot represent inconsistent values. To solve the problem of bias, we define a scaling factor, which corresponds to the change of the magnitude of a measured distance vector that is due to biases. Based on the scaling factor, we develop a new biased measurement model and apply the EKF to our model for estimating the coordinates of a mobile robot. Through localization experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11465122","htmlLink":"/document/5339225/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Robot Localization Using Biased Chirp-Spread-Spectrum Ranging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Robot Localization Using Biased Chirp-Spread-Spectrum Ranging","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2036633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082722S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5508599","articleId":"5339225","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339226,"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Kobayashi","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5350899/5339226/5339226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wataru Kobayashi was born in Chiba, Japan, in 1980.

We optimized the multiquantum wells (MQWs) for LD and EAM separately to realize uncooled operation. We employed a conduction band offset (\u00bf\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ec</i>\n) of around 250 meV for the LD and 150 meV for the EAM. The number of well layers was set at 6 for the LD and 12 for the EAM, respectively. We fabricated the EML using a butt-joint (BJ) process to allow us to design the LD and the EAM independently. We introduced a ridge waveguide structure for the LD and EAM waveguides, and designed the width of the LD and EAM mesa to achieve a high optical coupling efficiency between the LD and the EAM. We then used the 200-\u00bf m-long EAM for 10-Gb/s operation and the 150- \u00bfm-long EAM for 40-Gb/s operation, and thus obtained a dynamic extinction ratio of over 9 dB at 10 Gb/s from -25 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C and of 8.2 dB at 40 Gb/s from -15 to 80\u00b0C. We achieved a power penalty of less than 2 dB after an 80-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission at 10 Gb/s and a 2-km SMF transmission at 40 Gb/s over a wide temperature range. These results confirm the suitability of this EML with a BJ structure for use as a 10-Gb/s or 40-Gb/s uncooled light source.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Optical device fabrication","Optical waveguides","Temperature distribution","Diode lasers","Energy consumption","Optical transmitters","Quantum well devices","Optical coupling","Extinction ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","electroabsorption","electro-optical modulation","integrated optoelectronics","optical fabrication","optical fibre communication","optical transmitters","power consumption","quantum well lasers","ridge waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["butt-joint structure","DFB laser diodes","uncooled electroabsorption modulator","power consumption","optical transmitters","multiquantum wells laser diodes","conduction band offset","ridge waveguide structure","optical coupling efficiency","dynamic extinction ratio","single-mode fiber transmission","temperature sensitivity","side-mode suppression ratio","chirp parameter","size 200 mum","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","size 150 mum","bit rate 40 Gbit/s","temperature -25 degC to 100 degC","temperature -15 degC to 80 degC","distance 80 km","distance 2 km","InGaAlAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Butt-joint (BJ) structure","DFB laser","electro absorption modulator","InGaAlAs","uncooled operation","10 Gb/s","40 Gb/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2036865","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5350899/05339226.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5350899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2036865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Fabrication of 10-/40-Gb/s, Uncooled Electroabsorption Modulator Integrated DFB Laser With Butt-Joint Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Fabrication of 10-/40-Gb/s, Uncooled Electroabsorption Modulator Integrated DFB Laser With Butt-Joint Structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339226/","volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339226/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11152694","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Fabrication of 10-/40-Gb/s, Uncooled Electroabsorption Modulator Integrated DFB Laser With Butt-Joint Structure","sourcePdf":"jlt-kobayashi-2036865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.294786S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5350899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5350899","articleId":"5339226","onlineDate":"20 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5339227,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshan Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5339227/5339227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qingshan Liu (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in automation and computer-aided engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Automation, Southeast University.

This magazine alone dedicated its March/April 2009 issue and significant other space throughout the year to the topic. Cloud computing's potential lies not only in the evolution of technology but also in a sourcing strategy that uses resources shared by increasingly larger volumes of users. Further potential lies in the commoditization of cloud computing services - that is, a market in which price primarily differentiates cloud computing services. Although the entire IT community will need to address significant challenges, the result will be decreased prices, increased numbers of services, and improved performance not only in the near term but also the longer term. The result should be a decade or more in which cloud computing providers and users all benefit from future technology advancements, cloud efficiencies, and market competition. In response to the as to whether cloud computing is just the same old IT packaged in a new bottle, or is it really new wine?The authors believe that not only is it new wine, but one of a vintage that will improve with maturity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IT Professional","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294/5339316/05339332.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IT Professional","doi":"10.1109/MITP.2009.117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITP.2009.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing: Will Commodity Services Benefit Users Long Term?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Application software","Resource management","Data security","Phase measurement","Twitter","Packaging","Middleware","Runtime environment","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","commodity services","sourcing strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart IT","IT Professional","cloud computing","services computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing: Will Commodity Services Benefit Users Long Term?","volume":"11","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5339332/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10980184","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing: Will Commodity Services Benefit Users Long Term?","sourcePdf":"mit2009060057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.374813S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6294","isNumber":"5339316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6294","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5339316","articleId":"5339332","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339404,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Poulkov","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Poulkov","id":"37680505600"},{"name":"Miglen Ovtcharov","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Miglen","lastName":"Ovtcharov","id":"37680507500"},{"name":"Georgi Iliev","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Georgi","lastName":"Iliev","id":"37282360200"},{"name":"Zlatka Nikolova","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Zlatka","lastName":"Nikolova","id":"37680507700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4382-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4383-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339404","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"In this paper we propose a scheme for radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation in gigabit digital subscriber line (GDSL) systems using adaptive complex narrowband filter banks.

Energy consumption represents a barrier challenge in many sensor network applications that require long lifetimes, usually an order of several years. Sensor nodes, as constituents of wireless sensor networks, are battery driven devices and operate on an extremely frugal energy budget. Conventional low-power design techniques and hardware architectures only provide partial solutions which are insufficient for sensor networks with energy-hungry sensors.

The proposed schemes perform comparable to recent concatenation of RS and LDPC codes proposal, and solve the problem of nonexistence of A/D converters operating above 100 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2009.5339509","startPage":"402","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite, Cable, and Broadcasting Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite, Cable, and Broadcasting Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325507/5339385/05339509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2009.5339509","endPage":"405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional turbo product and generalized LDPC codes with component RS codes suitable for use in beyond 100 Gb/s optical transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional turbo product and generalized LDPC codes with component RS codes suitable for use in beyond 100 Gb/s optical transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339509/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11022072","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional turbo product and generalized LDPC codes with component RS codes suitable for use in beyond 100 Gb/s optical transmission","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"CMT2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050136S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325507","isNumber":"5339385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325507","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5339385","articleId":"5339509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339521,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering, Aleksandra Mevdvedeva 14, 18000 Nis, Serbia"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37331381000"},{"name":"Bratislav Milovanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering, Aleksandra Mevdvedeva 14, 18000 Nis, Serbia"],"firstName":"Bratislav","lastName":"Milovanovi\u0107","id":"37299972500"},{"name":"Neboj\u0161a Don\u010dov","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering, Aleksandra Mevdvedeva 14, 18000 Nis, Serbia"],"firstName":"Neboj\u0161a","lastName":"Don\u010dov","id":"37323441900"},{"name":"Aleksandar Marin\u010di\u0107","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, 11000 Beograd, Serbia"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Marin\u010di\u0107","id":"37444944300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4382-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4383-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339521","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339521","abstract":"In this paper, new neural network approach for characterization of cylindrical metallic cavity loaded with multilayer dielectric is suggested.

Traditionally, beamformers are realized as hybrid or monolithically integrated analog sub-systems. Their wideband operation is plagued by higher loss, amplitude and phase misbalances, weight, complex integration, etc. All these factors contribute to the errors in beam-pointing and geo-location, as well as antenna pattern contamination. This paper compares the performance of analog and digital beamformers realized for wideband operation through HF/VHF range. Recent advances in digital integrated circuits have contributed to not only improved performance of analog to digital (ADC) and digital to analog (DAC) converters and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) but also to their reduced cost. Thus, we are now able to realize complete modeforming functionality in a digital domain and thus enhance the performance of beamformers. Modelling, performance, and realization of analog and digital beamformers for the mode 1 operation of a 4-arm spiral are discussed and relevant conclusions drawn.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2009.5339545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339385","startPage":"372","endPage":"375","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite, Cable, and Broadcasting Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325507/5339385/05339545.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband analog and digital beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339545/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband analog and digital beamforming","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11022050","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband analog and digital beamforming","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"AP3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064071S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325507","isNumber":"5339385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325507","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5339385","articleId":"5339545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339571,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Photoelectric Information & Communication Engineering, Beijing, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yi Zhang","id":"37676514800"},{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qi Liu","id":"37596028900"},{"name":"Lan Xie","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lan Xie","id":"37671090000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5158-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339571","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"A new scenario of multiple access technology for beyond 3G wireless communications named CDD- dual-CDMA is proposed. CDD (code-division duplex) is a method to improve the spectrum efficiency by adding smart codes into time-division duplex (TDD) technology. The concept of dual-CDMA (dual-code division multiple access) is dividing traffic channels by both LAS (large area synchronous) codes and LS (loosely synchronous) cods, in order to eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiple access interference (MAI). At the same time, the problem that the number of available smart codes is limited could also be solved. In the paper, the performance of CDD- dual-CDMA is analyzed. The result of simulation shows that BER (bit error rate) performance of CDD- dual-CDMA is much better than traditional random codes. Additionally, CDD- dual-CDMA scenario is a flexible scheme, and can be used for improvement of TD-SCDMA system. Therefore, CDD- dual-CDMA scenario is more suitable for the future mobile communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335538/5339549/05339571.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"187","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new radio access scheme based on CDMA for B3G wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Interference elimination","Multiple access interference","Autocorrelation","Information science","Performance analysis","Bit error rate","3G mobile communication","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","error statistics","intersymbol interference","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beyond 3G wireless communications","radio access scheme","multiple access technology","code division duplex","smart codes","time division duplex","dual code division multiple access","large area synchronous codes","loosely synchronous cods","inter-symbol interference","multiple access interference","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless communication","radio access","CDMA","B3G"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new radio access scheme based on CDMA for B3G wireless communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984716","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new radio access scheme based on CDMA for B3G wireless communications","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"201569227676ANewRadioAccessSchemebasedonCDMAforB3G.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072975S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335538","isNumber":"5339549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335538","xplore-issue":"5339549","articleId":"5339571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5339578,"authors":[{"name":"Dongliang Guan","affiliation":["Institute of Software Engineering, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Dongliang Guan","id":"37088277220"},{"name":"Gang Xiong","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Gang Xiong","id":"37087260143"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5158-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339578","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339578","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Performance loss","White spaces","Diversity reception","Network topology","Collaboration","Software engineering","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radio networks","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primary user detection","cognitive radio networks","correlated noise","cooperative spectrum sensing","suboptimal fusion rule","implementation complexity","asymptotic detection probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339578","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335538/5339549/05339578.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of primary user in cognitive radio networks under correlated noise","abstract":"This paper presents the cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks under spatially correlated noise.

Energy detection is commonly used in local spectrum sensing. However, performance of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection is damaged due to the noise uncertainty in realistic environment. In this paper, blind source separation algorithm is introduced to spectrum sensing for cognitive radio. Therefore local blind spectrum sensing is proposed, which is based on source separation. Blind spectrum sensing does not require any information of the source signal and the channel. So it can accomplish local spectrum sensing on total blind. Further, because of the advantage of blind spectrum sensing, we can exploit it to cooperative spectrum sensing. And cooperative spectrum sensing based on blind source separation is given, which can improve reliability of cooperative spectrum sensing. Numerical analysis and computer simulation suggest that proposed algorithm achieves the vacant spectrum sensing and overcomes effect of noise uncertainty to statistical decision. Moreover, blind spectrum sensing should be better than energy detection for correlated signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339595","startPage":"398","endPage":"402","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335538/5339549/05339595.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on blind source separation for cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on blind source separation for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339595/","accessionNumber":"10984740","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339595/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on blind source separation for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"0101569226979CooperativeSpectrumSensingBasedonBlin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049633S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335538","isNumber":"5339549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335538","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5339549","articleId":"5339595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5339612,"authors":[{"name":"Yuming Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Ge","id":"37402946100"},{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291601000"},{"name":"Shan Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37405950700"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5158-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339612","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Frequency","FCC","Sun","Computers","Throughput","Channel capacity","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","quality of service","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic distributed spectrum decision","cognitive radio networks","spectrum quality","quality of service","primary users arrival probability","spectrum handoff rate"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADSD: An Automatic Distributed Spectrum Decision method in Cognitive Radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339549","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Future Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335538/5339549/05339612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFIN.2009.5339612","startPage":"253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339612","abstract":"With the development of Cognitive Radio networks, in order to fully utilize the scarce spectrum resources, secondary users are capable of exploiting the available spectrum of primary users. However, when there are several spectrum options available, how to select an appropriate one for the secondary user according to the spectrum quality and the QoS requirements of different kinds of applications is a new challenge. In this paper, we propose a new Automatic Distributed Spectrum Decision (ADSD) method to solve this problem. ADSD considers multiple characterization parameters, in particular, the primary users' arrival probability, to estimate the quality of the available spectrum options. A weight self-generation mechanism is included to automatically determine the weights of different parameters, thus avoiding the difficulty and irrationality when relying on the users to specify the weights directly. In addition, in conjunction with the reconfiguration mechanism, ADSD can reduce the rate of spectrum handoffs by reconfiguring the transmission parameters rather than making a new decision for the existing transmission. Simulation results show that without any users' interference, ADSD can automatically select the appropriate spectrum for transmission and significantly improve the Cognitive Radio network performance in terms of throughput and the spectrum handoff rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10984696","htmlLink":"/document/5339612/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"ADSD: An Automatic Distributed Spectrum Decision method in Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADSD: An Automatic Distributed Spectrum Decision method in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0021569213533ADSDAnAutomaticDistributedSpectrumDec.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053356S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335538","isNumber":"5339549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335538","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5339549","articleId":"5339612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339633,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Najmaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Najmaei","id":"37541969500"},{"name":"Mehrdad R.

A new approach is proposed for generating an efficient representation of the human body by considering its dimensions, position, and orientation. This model takes advantage of superquadric functions to represent the human body more realistically than using primitive shapes. By taking advantage of this model, a new measure of danger involved in robot operation is proposed. This approach significantly improves the effectiveness of danger evaluation by considering a more precise body model. The danger index is then used as part of the path planning algorithm to guarantee the safety of operations. The method is evaluated on a CRS-F3 industrial manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/TEPRA.2009.5339633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPRA.2009.5339633","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335443/5339615/05339633.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superquadric obstacle modeling and a danger evaluation method with applications in safe planning for human-safe industrial robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Superquadric obstacle modeling and a danger evaluation method with applications in safe planning for human-safe industrial robots","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superquadric obstacle modeling and a danger evaluation method with applications in safe planning for human-safe industrial robots","confLoc":"Woburn, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"023331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088678S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335443","isNumber":"5339615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335443","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5339615","articleId":"5339633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5339646,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Svab","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making and Control, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Svab","id":"37680492200"},{"name":"Tomas Krajnik","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making and Control, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Krajnik","id":"37680494000"},{"name":"Jan Faigl","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making and Control, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Faigl","id":"37540566100"},{"name":"Libor Preucil","affiliation":["Gerstner Laboratory for Intelligent Decision Making and Control, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Libor","lastName":"Preucil","id":"37298966000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4991-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4992-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0526"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0534"}],"articleNumber":"5339646","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Robustness","Embedded computing","Lighting","Object detection","Feature extraction","Computer vision","Robots","Navigation","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","navigation","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based speeded up robust feature","field programmable gate array","SURF algorithm","salient points extraction","image descriptor","feature descriptor extraction algorithm","interest point detection algorithm","algorithms natural parallelism","FPGA logic","precision value","repeatability feature","embedded system application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine vision","visual navigation","SURF","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"We present an implementation of the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

RFID readers are often static and carefully deployed in a planned manner. However, the distribution and movements of tags are often dynamically changed and unpredictable. We study a challenging problem of scheduling the activation of the readers without collision such that the system can work in a stable way in the long term. Here a schedule is stable if at any time slot, the number of total unread tags is bounded from above with high probability under this scheduling. In this paper, we propose a stable reader activation scheduling protocol, RASPberry, in multi-reader RFID systems. We analytically prove that our scheduling protocol, RASPberry, is stable if the arrival rate of tags is less than the processing rate of all readers. In RASPberry, at any time slot, a reader can determine its status using only information of readers within a local neighborhood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the stability problem of reader activation scheduling in RFID systems.

Specifically, distributed sensing has been recognized as a viable means to enhance the incumbent signal detection by exploiting the diversity of sensors. However, it is challenging to make such distributed sensing secure due mainly to the unique features of DSA networks - openness of a low-layer protocol stack in SDR devices and non-existence of communications between primary and secondary devices. To address this challenge, we propose attack-tolerant distributed sensing protocol (ADSP), under which sensors in close proximity are grouped into a cluster, and sensors in a cluster cooperatively safeguard distributed sensing. The heart of ADSP is a novel shadow fading correlation-based filter tailored to anomaly detection, by which the fusion center prefilters abnormal sensor reports via cross-validation. By realizing this correlation filter, ADSP minimizes the impact of an attack on the performance of distributed sensing, while incurring minimal processing and communications overheads. The efficacy of our scheme is validated on a realistic two-dimensional shadow-fading field, which accurately approximates real-world shadowing environments. Our extensive simulation-based evaluation shows that ADSP significantly reduces the impact of attacks on incumbent detection performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339659","startPage":"294","endPage":"303","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335585/5339659/05339675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attack-tolerant distributed sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339675/","displayDocTitle":"Attack-tolerant distributed sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10980045","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attack-tolerant distributed sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks","confLoc":"Plainsboro, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"301569212439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075638S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335585","isNumber":"5339659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335585","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5339659","articleId":"5339675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339686,"authors":[{"name":"Ranveer Chandra","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Ranveer","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37398179800"},{"name":"Sandeep Karanth","affiliation":["Microsoft Research India, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Karanth","id":"37064225800"},{"name":"Thomas Moscibroda","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Moscibroda","id":"37295462200"},{"name":"Vishnu Navda","affiliation":["Microsoft Research India, India"],"firstName":"Vishnu","lastName":"Navda","id":"37283912800"},{"name":"Jitendra Padhye","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Padhye","id":"37270006100"},{"name":"Ramachandran Ramjee","affiliation":["Microsoft Research India, India"],"firstName":"Ramachandran","lastName":"Ramjee","id":"37283567000"},{"name":"Lenin Ravindranath","affiliation":["MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Lenin","lastName":"Ravindranath","id":"37680214900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4635-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4634-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"5339686","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","Broadcasting","Propagation losses","Access protocols","Virtual prototyping","Streaming media","Multicast protocols","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","IP networks","multicast communication","telecommunication security","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DirCast","multicast system","IP multicast applications","multicast streams","Wi-Fi networks","unicast transmissions","802.11 MAC protocol","wireless access points","multicast traffic","virtual multicast interface","security"]}],"abstract":"IP multicast applications such as live lecture broadcasts are being increasingly used in enterprise and campus networks. In many cases, end hosts access these multicast streams using Wi-Fi networks. However, multicast over Wi-Fi suffers from several well-known problems such as low data rate, high losses and unfairness vis-a-vis other contending unicast transmissions. In this paper we present DirCast, a system to solve many of these problems. DirCast requires no changes to the 802.11 MAC protocol or the wireless access points. Software changes are required on clients only if they wish to participate in multicast sessions. The aim of DirCast system is to minimize the airtime consumed by the multicast traffic, while simultaneously improving client experience. To meet these goals, the DirCast converts multicast packets to unicast packets targeted to certain selected clients; other clients receive these packets by listening in promiscuous mode. The target clients are carefully selected to minimize loss rate experienced by the non-targeted clients. If necessary, clients are forced to change the AP they are associated with. In addition, DirCast uses proactive adaptive FEC to further reduce the loss rate and implements a novel virtual multicast interface in order to be compatible with the security needs of the enterprise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DirCast using extensive experiments in a Wi-Fi prototype implementation and through large-scale simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DirCast: A practical and efficient Wi-Fi multicast system","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339686","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335585/5339659/05339686.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"DirCast: A practical and efficient Wi-Fi multicast system","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339686/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DirCast: A practical and efficient Wi-Fi multicast system","confLoc":"Plainsboro, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"171569210938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070333S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335585","isNumber":"5339659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335585","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5339659","articleId":"5339686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5339688,"authors":[{"name":"Peilong Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China","NEC Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Peilong","lastName":"Li","id":"37535267300"},{"name":"Honghai Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Honghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280794700"},{"name":"Baohua Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Baohua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37291565700"},{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan","id":"37282909600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4635-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4634-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"5339688","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data systems","Video coding","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Multimedia communication","Broadcasting","Modulation coding","Streaming media","Resource management","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","dynamic programming","greedy algorithms","image sequences","modulation coding","multicast communication","resource allocation","telecommunication services","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video multicast","multicarrier wireless data systems","4G cellular networks","broadcast services","scalable video coding","wireless multicast service","modulation scheme","coding scheme","wireless multicast streaming","resource allocation","two-step dynamic programming algorithm","video encoding process","greedy algorithm","video sequences","limited radio resources"]}],"abstract":"Future 4G cellular networks are featured with high data rate and improved coverage, which will enable realtime video multicast and broadcast services. Scalable video coding is very appropriate for wireless multicast service because it allows to choose different modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) for different video layers and can provide good video quality to users in good channel conditions while still maintaining reasonable video quality for other users. In order to apply scalable video coding to wireless multicast streaming, it is important to choose appropriate MCS for each video layer and to determine the right resource allocation among multiple video sessions. In this paper we propose a two-step dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal total system utility of all users where the system utility can be a generic non-negative, non-decreasing function of received rate. Our algorithm supports variable layer size and thus allows flexibility during the video encoding process. Simulation results show that our algorithm offers significant improvement on the video quality over a naive algorithm and an adapted greedy algorithm, especially in the scenarios with multiple real video sequences and limited radio resources.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339688","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335585/5339659/05339688.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339659","startPage":"141","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable video multicast in multi-carrier wireless data systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scalable video multicast in multi-carrier wireless data systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339688/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339688/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable video multicast in multi-carrier wireless data systems","confLoc":"Plainsboro, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"151569211935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088191S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335585","isNumber":"5339659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335585","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5339659","articleId":"5339688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5339711,"authors":[{"name":"Xingcheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Xingcheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292949900"},{"name":"Kang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37673326300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339711","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Bit error rate","Convolutional codes","Information science","Sun","Statistics","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","block codes","decoding","error statistics","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block turbo codes","adaptive SNR estimation","decoding algorithm","adaptive chase algorithm","decoding complexity","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit error rate (BER)","block Turbo codes (BTC)","Chase algorithm","iterative decoding","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)"]}],"abstract":"The SNR values in conventional turbo decoding with the adaptive chase algorithm are pre-fixed, which is not practical in applications.

Then, by utilizing the special structure of the system, we propose a low complexity resource allocation scheme, which is proved to be globally optimal. The simulations prove that the proposed scheme improves the system capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDM multihop system","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339718","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339718.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDM multihop system","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339718/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985041","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDM multihop system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"203paper6722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05661S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5339720,"authors":[{"name":"Feng She","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"She","id":"37298588500"},{"name":"Hanwen Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hanwen","lastName":"Luo","id":"37275771900"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291849800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339720","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Quantization","Scheduling algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis","Downlink","Base stations","Throughput","Costs","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radio broadcasting","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity multiuser scheduling","MIMO broadcast channel","channel quantization","low complexity user scheduling","multiantenna broadcast systems","downlink systems","zero-forcing multiplexing","quantization technology","channel matrix","unoverlapped channel regions","semiorthogonal region sets"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the design and analysis of low complexity user scheduling algorithm in multiantenna broadcast (downlink) systems under zero-forcing multiplexing.

The theoretical analysis is verified by simulations. For the metric of the averaged SINR against signal to noise ratio (SNR), the theoretical result matches the simulation result perfectly.

This results suggests that the combining algorithm proposed here is capable of improving the combining SNR without complex computation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Adaptive arrays","Iterative algorithms","Antenna arrays","Numerical simulation","Gaussian noise","Chaos","Information science","Performance analysis","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","least mean squares methods","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal arraying","MMSE estimator","digital signal combining","blind combining","receiver","signal-to-noise ratio","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signal arraying","optimal combining","MMSE","weight estimate"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339748","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339748.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combining algorithm for signal arraying using MMSE estimator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A combining algorithm for signal arraying using MMSE estimator","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10985105","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339748/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combining algorithm for signal arraying using MMSE estimator","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"222paper6868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052854S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5339753,"authors":[{"name":"Li-ke Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Li-ke","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677583400"},{"name":"Yi-hua Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yi-hua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37280218500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339753","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Traffic control","Statistical analysis","Educational institutions","Computer science","Telecommunication traffic","Frequency conversion","Wireless communication","Wireless networks","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","spectrum sharing scheme","frequency spectrum","radio bands","dynamic spectrum access","Markov chain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic spectrum access","Cognitive radio networks","Markov chain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339753","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339753.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spectrum sharing scheme for cognitive radio networks","abstract":"The problem that large amount of spectrum resource remains unused has increasingly attracted attention of researchers.

frequency division multiple access (FDMA) have gained enough attention recently. However, the non-linearity of amplifier deteriorates the performances of these two schemes. On the assumption of non-linear amplifier applied, we compare the block error rate (BLER) and throughput performances between SC-FDMA and OFDM schemes in the framework of third generation (3G) long-term evolution (LTE) systems, where the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) technique with slow power control is used. Our simulation results show that the impacts of non-linearity on two schemes are different and dependent on several factors including the power gain of the amplifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339757/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985113","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of amplifier nonlinearities on uplink performance in 3G LTE systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of amplifier nonlinearities on uplink performance in 3G LTE systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"228paper6637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053112S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5339762,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory Information Science Institution, State key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674523500"},{"name":"Linjing Zhao","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory Information Science Institution, State key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Linjing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279828400"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory Information Science Institution, State key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339762","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"abstract":"In cognitive radio, secondary users require fast and accurate spectrum sensing, so that they can dynamically monitor the spectrum and rapidly tune their parameters to utilize the spectrum available, as well as avoid causing interference to primary users. The traditional spectrum sensing methods in a wideband cognitive radio are challenging to implement since they require very high sampling rates at or above the Nyquist rate. A new technique called compressive sensing (CS) can solve the problem, which exploits the sparsity of signal's frequency response. In this paper, a parallel spectrum sensing structure in cognitive radio is proposed. In the structure, we use compressive sensing and wavelet to process the signal in each branch. Then we get the final renconstruction output from the results of all branches. The modified sensing method based on this special structure is more accurate since it can reduce the effect of noise. Simulation results show the proposed method has performance improvement over traditional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339762.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified spectrum sensing method for wideband cognitive radio based on compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Cognitive radio","Radio frequency","Matching pursuit algorithms","Interference","Sampling methods","Chromium","Narrowband","Band pass filters","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing method","wideband cognitive radio","compressive sensing","Nyquist rate","parallel spectrum sensing structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","compressive sensing","parallel","sub-Nyquist sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A modified spectrum sensing method for wideband cognitive radio based on compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985116","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified spectrum sensing method for wideband cognitive radio based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"261paper7144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058431S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5339770,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"37400967700"},{"name":"Guizhong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guizhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281348100"},{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675422800"},{"name":"Lijun He","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"He","id":"37395565400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339770","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Downlink","Streaming media","Cross layer design","Decoding","Switches","Frequency conversion","Physical layer","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication network management","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet scheduling","resource allocation","video transmission","downlink OFDMA networks","cross-layer optimization function","video quality","IEEE 802.16"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video transmission","packet scheduling","resource allocation","OFDMA","cross-layer design"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of multiuser packet scheduling and resource allocation for video transmission over downlink OFDMA networks.

For shadowed 60 GHz IFE systems, high resolution and multi-antenna time-varying channel characterisation are mandatory. This paper presents the first wideband 60 GHz real-time multi-antenna channel sounder (MCS) and measurement results within an Airbus-340 aircraft cabin. The MCS is a 3 GHz bandwidth system based on a modular architecture with 2 real-time acquisition channels enabled with a dynamic range up to 40 dB. This system architecture allowed the study of different in-cabin access point (AP) configurations and the inclusion of correlated shadowing by human bodies (SHB) for macro-diversity implementations. The frequency, phase and impulse response of the MCS has been tested based on back-to-back calibration data and its dynamic range verified. As example of the 60 GHz MCS application, the delay spread and the coherent bandwidth have been calculated for the in-cabin channel. Besides, comparisons between static and time-variant conditions are presented.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339781","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339781.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"60 GHz in-cabin real-time channel sounding","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339781/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985130","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339781/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60 GHz in-cabin real-time channel sounding","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"255paper7074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038759S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5339788,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Yin","id":"37280166700"},{"name":"Yi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37067733900"},{"name":"Fuqiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fuqiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289975000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339788","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","MIMO","Transmission line matrix methods","Dispersion","Relays","Solid modeling","Frequency","Indoor environments","Diffraction","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","geometry","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband channel model","keyhole propagation scenario","experimental evaluation","geometry based generic model","propagation channel","keyhole environment","direction of departure","direction of arrival","Doppler frequency","correlation matrix","power spectral density"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339788","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339788.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generic wideband channel model for keyhole propagation scenarios and experimental evaluation","abstract":"In this contribution we propose a geometry-based generic model to characterize a propagation channel in a keyhole environment.

A gradient-based scheduling framework is formulated. The proposed scheduling scheme can efficiently support the services with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. According to the channel state information (CSI) which is feedback from the mobile station and the queue state information (QSI) which is obtained from the upper layer, the proposed algorithm dynamically assigns the transmit mode (i.e., the number of the users to serve) to maximize the system throughput by fully exploiting the multiplexing gain and the multiuser diversity gain. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the system performance in terms of the system throughput, packet dropping probability, and the ratio of unsatisfied minimum data rate of non-real-time services. The effect of the fairness factor is also evaluated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339803","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross-layer scheduling scheme for SDMA systems with limited feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer scheduling scheme for SDMA systems with limited feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339803/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985147","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339803/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer scheduling scheme for SDMA systems with limited feedback","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"177paper6879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083882S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339804,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292452900"},{"name":"Rui Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37407958600"},{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guanding","lastName":"Yu","id":"37288513300"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Jietao Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Research Department, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jietao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407608100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339804","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Power system relaying","Fading","Computational complexity","System performance","Power system reliability","Algorithm design and analysis","Regeneration engineering","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","OFDM modulation","optimisation","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimal power allocation","relay selection","subchannel pairing algorithm","OFDM based regenerative relay network","system performance","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"Power allocation, relay selection and subchannel pairing are three important issues in OFDM based relay wireless systems to improve the system performance and reliability.

We then present two novel relay auction (RA) approaches to allocate time-slots among MRs and analyze the bidding strategy using the solution concept of Nash equilibrium. Through simulations, we find that the proposed RA algorithms can achieve competitive performance in terms of resource allocation efficiency compared with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) approaches, while having the capability to strike a proper balance between efficiency and fairness by adjusting the payment function. Specifically, with a smaller payment parameter value, the RA algorithms can also achieve much better connection blocking probability performance than VCG algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay auction algorithms for downlink bandwidth allocation in IEEE 802.16-Based OFDM/TDMA wireless mesh networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339842","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Relay auction algorithms for downlink bandwidth allocation in IEEE 802.16-Based OFDM/TDMA wireless mesh networks","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339842/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay auction algorithms for downlink bandwidth allocation in IEEE 802.16-Based OFDM/TDMA wireless mesh networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"137paper6733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056875S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339848,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37632521600"},{"name":"Pingzhi Fan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Pingzhi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801400"},{"name":"Li Hao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Hao","id":"37288688700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339848","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Detectors","Bit error rate","Decorrelation","Rayleigh channels","Interference","Telecommunication traffic","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","least mean squares methods","Rayleigh channels","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channels","multiuser receivers","CDMA random access","multiuser detectors","MMSE detector","bit-error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading channel","CDMA","random access","multiuser detection"]}],"abstract":"The random access systems, exploiting multiuser detectors such as MMSE detector and decorrelator, over large random spreading CDMA channel subject to Rayleigh fading is investigated, under the assumption of infinite number of users, infinite spreading gain, and their ratio converging to a constant.

Moreover, we present some complexity reduction techniques including frequency domain partial averaging which only requires the knowledge of the number of interfered subcarriers. By exploiting the results of decoding, the proposed scheme can achieve an accurate estimation of noise plus interference variance, and a quasi-optimal bit error ratio (BER) performance. It is also robust against the variation of interference power and bandwidth, and the positive error of the knowledge of the number of interfered subcarriers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth

Then, we carefully investigated the observing correlation among CR links and its influence on the end-to-end throughput. After that, we proposed a novel routing metric named Observing Correlation Aware (OCA) routing metric to capture the end-to-end throughput.

However, the Tanner graph constructed with the PEG algorithm is non-structured, which leads to random distributions of the positions of 1's in the corresponding parity-check matrix. In this paper, an improved algorithm based on the PEG algorithm for constructing quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes is proposed. The proposed algorithm can eliminate short cycles efficiently and gain low error-floors. What is more important, the proposed QC-LDPC codes construction method is hardware-friendly because of its quasi-cyclic structure. Our simulation results demonstrate that the codes constructed with the proposed algorithm has better performance than the PEG algorithm over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and Rayleigh flat fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339908","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339908.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved algorithm for constructing QC-LDPC codes based on the PEG algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An improved algorithm for constructing QC-LDPC codes based on the PEG algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339908/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10985062","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339908/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved algorithm for constructing QC-LDPC codes based on the PEG algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"073paper6655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082194S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5339910,"authors":[{"name":"Ce-lun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ce-lun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600007200"},{"name":"Jian-ping An","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-ping","lastName":"An","id":"37286060500"},{"name":"Xiang-yuan Bu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-yuan","lastName":"Bu","id":"37298628900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339910","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Galois fields","Sum product algorithm","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Power engineering and energy","Channel coding","Sparse matrices","Power engineering computing","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","Galois fields","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding algorithm","nonbinary LDPC codes","low density parity check codes","high order Galois field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["block codes","Galois field","iteration decoding","min-sum algorithm","nonbinary LDPC codes","sum-product algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A simplified decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over high order Galois field is proposed to reduce the complexity of traditional sum-product algorithm (SPA).

In this paper, to enable coexistence between a secondary user and a primary user, a novel method called EAIC was proposed for spectral sculpting of OFDM signal effectively. In EAIC, however, the cancellation signals cause self-interferences to OFDM data tones so that the symbol-error-rate (SER) performance was degraded especially in high order modulation such as 64 QAM. In this paper, a new method called EAIC with self-interference constraint (EAIC-IC) is proposed, in which we analyze the interferences caused by cancellation signals, and then formulate an optimization problem to minimize both the total sidelobe power and the self-interferences.

Pure distributed compression of multiple correlated sources has been discussed much in the related literature, while taking the noisy communication channels into account is more suitable for the actual scenario. In this paper, a practical Distributed Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) scheme for multiple correlated sources is proposed. Besides considering the noisy channels and multiple sources, the processing of the noisy side information is also investigated here. By combining the Shannon theorem and the Slepian-Wolf theorem, the theoretical limits of the proposed DJSCC scheme are derived. An efficient coding strategy with a single Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is designed based on the theory to cope with both source and channel coding. The simulation results demonstrate the desired efficiency of our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339955","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339955.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed joint source-channel coding scheme for multiple correlated sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339955/","displayDocTitle":"A distributed joint source-channel coding scheme for multiple correlated sources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985224","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339955/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed joint source-channel coding scheme for multiple correlated sources","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"026paper6872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082564S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5339958,"authors":[{"name":"Tachporn Sanguanpuak","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tachporn","lastName":"Sanguanpuak","id":"37680349500"},{"name":"R.M.A.P Rajatheva","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"R.M.A.P","lastName":"Rajatheva","id":"37295806500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system relaying","Resource management","Diversity reception","Game theory","Pricing","Costs","Power engineering and energy","Energy consumption","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Pareto optimisation","pricing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power bargaining","amplify and forward relay channel","maximal ratio combining rate","game theoretical modeling","relay transmit power","Pareto optimal solution","necessary and sufficient conditions","pricing factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339958","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339958.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power bargaining for amplify and forward relay channel","abstract":"We consider a system of two user terminals, both of which are capable of acting as relay stations for each others. We consider a simple scenario where the user equipment that acts as an amplify-and-forward relay station tries to sell its data rate at some fixed price to the user equipment that acts as a source station. The benefit the source station receives is equal to the difference between the maximal ratio combining rate and the data rate it buys from the relay station, converted into a monetary value. The cost of cooperation for both the stations is reflected by their power consumption, which both of them want to reduce. This conflicting goal of increasing the revenue, while at the same time, decreasing the cost, by both the users, is studied using game theoretical modeling. The situation is modeled as a symmetric, two person bargaining game. The solution of such a game is unique and Pareto optimal. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the bargaining solution, and obtain explicit solutions for the source and the relay transmit power. Lastly, we plot a graph of the dependence of transmit power on the pricing factor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339958/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985226","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power bargaining for amplify and forward relay channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power bargaining for amplify and forward relay channel","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"021paper6928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038193S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339968,"authors":[{"name":"Jianmin Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407612100"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guanding","lastName":"Yu","id":"37288513300"},{"name":"Peiya Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peiya","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677090000"},{"name":"Aiping Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275718700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339968","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Cognitive radio","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Signal to noise ratio","Interference constraints","Quality of service","Centralized control","FCC","Distributed algorithms","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","distributed control","power control","quality of service","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio cellular network","distributed power control algorithm","secondary users","quality of service","QoS","interference temperature","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR","gradual removal strategy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose two distributed power control algorithms for cognitive radio cellular network (CogCell). Our objective is to maximize the number of admitted Secondary Users (SUs), while making sure both the Primary User's and SUs' requirements of Quality of Service (QoS) are satisfied with certain constraints. Here the PU's requirement of QoS is described that the Interference Temperature (IT) ascribed to SUs should not exceed a predefined threshold. Similarly, the SU's requirement of QoS is that the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at its receiver need to exceed a predetermined threshold. Taking into account the above requirements, it is not always possible that all SUs can be admitted concurrently, instead, one or more of them have to be removed so as to maximize the number of admitted SUs. Thus, we introduce the strategy of gradual removal into CogCell and propose two distributed power control algorithms. Simulation results show that our algorithms have better performances than other algorithms in terms of maximizing the number of admitted SUs.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339968","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339968.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339968","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power control with gradual removal in cognitive radio cellular network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control with gradual removal in cognitive radio cellular network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339968/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5339968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985234","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control with gradual removal in cognitive radio cellular network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"011paper6989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069307S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335879","isNumber":"5339704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335879","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5339704","articleId":"5339968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5339969,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Orange Laboratories, France Telecom Research and Development Center (Beijing), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37280053100"},{"name":"Qiming Deng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Qiming","lastName":"Deng","id":"37683076100"},{"name":"Xiajun Qiao","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xiajun","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37682044600"},{"name":"Daqing Gu","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom Research and Development Center (Beijing), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daqing","lastName":"Gu","id":"37404785200"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Hongwen Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Hongwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291237400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4337-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5339969","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Prototypes","Signal detection","Detectors","OFDM","Software testing","System testing","Software radio","Software prototyping","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","software radio","UHF detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDR implementation","cognitive radio","sensing spectrum access","disjoint spectrum access","software defined radio","TV band","signal cyclostationary feature","chi-square test","CMMB signal","DMB-T signal","discontinuous spectrum transmission implementation","OFDM links","frequency 100 MHz to 700 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","sensing","cyclostationary","spectrum aggregation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339969","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335879/5339704/05339969.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDR implementation of cognitive radio: Sensing and disjoint spectrum access","abstract":"This paper presents the activities in realizing and testing cognitive radio system by means of a software defined radio.

Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified. The approach is verified with patterns from the latest version of the Snort rule database. The experimental results show that after decomposition, a reduction in size of over 77% can be achieved on Snort signature patterns.","doi":"10.1109/DRCN.2009.5339986","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Workshop on Design of Reliable Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Workshop on Design of Reliable Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335584/5339979/05339986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRCN.2009.5339986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339979","startPage":"359","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage decomposition of SNORT rules towards efficient hardware implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5339986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage decomposition of SNORT rules towards efficient hardware implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5339986/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10984761","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5339986/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage decomposition of SNORT rules towards efficient hardware implementation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"rp00481569219133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057487S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335584","isNumber":"5339979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335584","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5339979","articleId":"5339986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"}]
