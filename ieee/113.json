An effective wave impedance in the traveling wave diode can be defined as the ratio of the space-average transverse electric and magnetic fields. This impedance is related to an effective characteristic impedance by a geometry factor. Thus the coupling question is reduced to the coupling between two transmission lines. In addition the diode is modeled in an equivalent transmission line. The equivalent series impedance and shunt admittance are found. The shunt admittance is approximately equal to the admittance (per unit length) of a discrete diode of identical doping profile.

Additionally, inclusion of nonempirical thickness correction factors derived previously by McDonald give coupling formulas which result in theoretical predictions for multiaperture couplers substantially in exact agreement with experiment (correcting small discrepancies previously noted by the author in a 1968 paper). This agreement is now so close that it becomes possible both to identify and explain the mutual interaction effects between closely spaced apretures in multiaperture couplers. It is shown that the mutual interaction is due to contradirectional (or backward) waves in the secondary arm, so that multiaperture interactions are manifested as elimination of the self-interactions of the individual apertures (since the high directivity of typical multiaperture couplers implies negligible backward wave amplitude).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25076/01130073.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"338","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Single and Multiaperature Waveguide Coupling Theory, Including Explanation of Mutual Interactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1980","displayDocTitle":"Improved Single and Multiaperature Waveguide Coupling Theory, Including Explanation of Mutual Interactions","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Apr. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Single and Multiaperature Waveguide Coupling Theory, Including Explanation of Mutual Interactions","sourcePdf":"01130073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034584S","chronDate":"Apr 1980","isNumber":"25076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1130073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1130087,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.

Since the first report of measurements on the switching speed of a Josephson junction in 1966, a large variety of circuits have been developed, with one having a delay of only 13 ps. With miniaturization beyond the present 2.5-mu m linewidths, this remarkable speed probably can be exceeded. It is pointed out that the high speed is combined with very low power so that the high packing density needed to make use of the speed is possible. The paper reviews the Josephson junction and its incorporation into logic gates and memory cells.

They make use of the two orthogonal modes (even and odd) of the coupled slot lines, and, therefore, have special port location, which is quite different from that of the conventional 180/spl deg/ hybrids such as a rat-race. That is, the two-ports, which correspond to the E-arm and the H-arm of the well-known waveguide magic-T, can be located on the same side, opposite to the other two ports. This feature is of a great practical advantage when applied to an MIC, because the crossing of the transmission lines can be omitted when this type of magic-T is applied to balanced-type circuits such as balanced mixers. Satisfactory experimental results at a center frecuency of 6 GHz are given. The isolation between the E- and the H-ports is better than 30 dB over an octave band, and the frequency sensitivity of the coupling is almost flat in the frequency range from 2 to 10 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25078/01130113.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"523","endPage":"528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New MIC Magic-T Using Coupled Slot Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1130113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1980","displayDocTitle":"A New MIC Magic-T Using Coupled Slot Lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130113/","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jun. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New MIC Magic-T Using Coupled Slot Lines","sourcePdf":"01130113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030842S","chronDate":"Jun 1980","isNumber":"25078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1130113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1130152,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results for the resonant iris can be used for various applications, such as the design of waveguide filters and matching networks. In the limiting cases of purely capacitive or inductive irises, the results agree exactly with existing experimental and numerical values. The size of the eigenvalue equation to be solved for the periodic structure equals half the number of ports of the network chracterization of the iris and is generally small (typically five to seven). The eigenvalues have good convergence properties with resect to the size of the matrix.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25080/01130183.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1130183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation in a Rectangular Waveguide Periodically Loaded with Resonant Irises","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loaded waveguides","Rectangular waveguides","Resonance","Waveguide discontinuities","Iris","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matched filters","Equations","Periodic structures","Convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1980","displayDocTitle":"Propagation in a Rectangular Waveguide Periodically Loaded with Resonant Irises","volume":"28","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation in a Rectangular Waveguide Periodically Loaded with Resonant Irises","sourcePdf":"01130183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028695S","chronDate":"Aug 1980","isNumber":"25080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1130183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1130186,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Hsiung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun Hsiung Chen","id":"37087161517"},{"name":"Chuen-Der Lien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chuen-Der Lien","id":"37087375012"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1130186","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1130186","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrons","Cyclotrons","Frequency","Masers","Heating","Tokamaks","Resonance","High power amplifiers","Plasma waves","Gyrotrons"]}],"abstract":"A systematic and intuitive procedure is proposed to derive the variational (or stationary) principle for non-seff-adjoint electromagnetic problems with various boundary conditions.

The low-pass prototype is synthesized in the form of a network with complex conjugate symmetry where the real frequency transmission zeros are extracted from both ends and realized by simple resonators separated by phase shifters. The remaining transmission zeros are realized by the central part of the filter in the form of a cross-coupled double array. This prototype is particularly suitable for designing waveguides bandpass filters and each real frequency transmission zero is independently tunable. Furthermore, in the case of the most complex transfer function with all possible types of transmission zeros, the realization requires only one type of coupling which is necessary in the important case of TE/sub011/ cylindrical mode cavity resonators. The general synthesis technique is given and the process illustrated by a nontrival example. Additionally, from the results of a computer program based upon the synthesis techniques, the important differences between the possible prototype forms for the same transfer function resulting from extracting the transmission zeros in different orders are cited.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25081/01130213.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1980.1130213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1130213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Extracted Pole Synthesis Technique with Applications to Low-Loss TE/sub011/ Mode Filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tellurium","Filtering theory","Network synthesis","Prototypes","Frequency synthesizers","Band pass filters","Transfer functions","Phase shifters","Filter bank","Resonator filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1980","displayDocTitle":"General Extracted Pole Synthesis Technique with Applications to Low-Loss TE/sub011/ Mode Filters","volume":"28","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Extracted Pole Synthesis Technique with Applications to Low-Loss TE/sub011/ Mode Filters","sourcePdf":"01130213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024891S","chronDate":"Sep 1980","isNumber":"25081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"116","articleId":"1130213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1130223,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, available theoretical results are inadequate to allow an accurate radiometer performance prediction in the presence of receiver gain fluctuations and other receiver characteristics with nonuniform fluctuation power spectra. An improved analysis of the total power radiometer Delta T is presented in terms of the receiver output fluctuation power spectral density and a transfer function due to postdetection filtering and periodic calibration. Verification of this analysis is obtained by measuring the fluctuation power spectrum of a 94-GHz receiver and comparing the predicted Delta T with a direct measurement. Numerical results including application to an example radiometer system are presented. These results indicate that the total power radiometer should function well in short integration time, periodically calibrated radiometer systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Diodes","Fluctuations","Microwave radiometry","Electron devices","Oscillators","Circuit noise","Power harmonic filters","Performance gain","Power measurement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1981.1130283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25085/01130283.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1981.1130283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of the Total Power Radiometer with Periodic Absolute Calibration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1130283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of the Total Power Radiometer with Periodic Absolute Calibration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130283/","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of the Total Power Radiometer with Periodic Absolute Calibration","sourcePdf":"01130283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042721S","chronDate":"Jan 1981","isNumber":"25085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1130283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1130286,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The necessity for these asymmetric solutions arose when it was discovered that it was impossible to realize certain useful transmission characteristics with the symmetric in-line structure, on account of their transmission zero pattern in the complex-plane representation of the transfer function. Furthermore, because the full coupling matrix is used instead of the even-mode matrix as with the symmetric solution, the asymmetric in-line realization process may be applied to electrically asymmetric matrices, such as those for single ended filters for multiplexer applications.

The low-loss properties of sapphire and semi-insulating GaAs substrates, combined with the excellent microwave performance of metal-semiconductor FET's (MESFET's), allows, for the first time, a truly monolithic approach to microwave integrated circuits. By monolithic we mean an approach wherein all passive and active circuit elements and interconnections are formed into the bulk, or onto the surface of the substrate by some deposition scheme, such as epitaxy, ion implantation, sputtering, evaporation, and other methods. The importance of this development is that microwave applications such as airborne phased-array systems based on a large number of identical circuits and requiring small physical volume and/or light weight, may, finally, become cost effective. The paper covers in some detail the design considerations that must be applied to monolithic microwave circuits in general, and to gallium arsenide circuits in particular. The important role being played by computer-aided design techniques is stressed. Numerous examples of monolithic circuits and components which illustrate the design principles are described. These provide a cross section of the world-wide effort in this field.

The maximum efficiency was 26 percent at 120.5-kW peak power, with an instantaneous bandwidth of 7.25 percent as measured in a high-beam power mode (65 kV, 7 A). In the low-beam power mode (40 kV, 4 A), the efficiency was 9.8 percent at 18.8-kW peak power at 9.3-percent instantaneous bandwidth.

A design diagram is given. Losses and coupling coefficients of the strips are calculated, as well.

A key feature is the use of an electrically modulated (10-kHz) dipole scatterer which is also mechanically spun (150 Hz) to create an amplitude- and phase-modulated backscattered field. The system is monostatic. The backscattered field is coherently detected by mixing with the CW reference. A phase-insensitive detector is used, comprised of two balanced mixers which are fed in quadrature phase by one of the RF inputs followed by a phase quadrature combiner. The resulting amplitude and phase of the 10-kHz output are proportional to the square of the RF field component along the instantaneous axis of the spinning dipole. Both are measured simultaneously and independently in real time. From these, the polarization properties can also be found, so the field is uniquely described. The system's application to scanning the E-field transmitted through Iossy, nonhomogeneous and anisotropic media (e.g., wood) is demonstrated. Other applications besides nondestructive testing are microwave vector holography, nearfield antenna measurements, and inverse scattering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1130535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1981","volume":"29","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probing Amplitude, Phase, and Polarization of Microwave Field Distributions in Real Time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probing Amplitude, Phase, and Polarization of Microwave Field Distributions in Real Time","sourcePdf":"01130535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021803S","chronDate":"Nov 1981","isNumber":"25096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1130535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1130593,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is shown that these four standards can be such that their reflection coefficient modulus = 1. Computer simulation proves that no singularity appears for both ideal and nonideal five- and six-port reflectometer in a wide range of phase distribution of reflection coefficients. A group of calibration results for a practical simple six-port is fisted to show this calibration procedure; by the use of these calibrated network parameters, some measurement results are presented and compared with the values obtained at the National Bureau of Standard, U.S.A. Both computer simulation and experimental results show that the numerical singularities which may be encountered in multiport calibration procedures are not an intrinsic properties of multiport but from related mathematical treatment.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1982.1131200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25106/01131200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1982.1131200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25106","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibration of Multiport Reflectometers by Means of Four Open/Short Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1131200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calibration of Multiport Reflectometers by Means of Four Open/Short Circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1131200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul.  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Jul. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibration of Multiport Reflectometers by Means of Four Open/Short Circuits","sourcePdf":"01131200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043932S","chronDate":"Jul.  1982","isNumber":"25106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1131200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1131204,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In approximating the original line by the equivalent line on an isotropic substrate, it is best to maintain h and w of the equivalent line equal to those of the original line. The reason is that the inflection frequency f/sub i/ is a function of w and h and that f/sub i/ plays an important role in calculating the dispersion. Three approximate dispersion formulas are derived owing to this idea. The results obtained by these formulas are compared with the other available theoretical and experimental results for sapphire substrates.

The method can be applied to the design of interstage equalizers for microwave amplifiers. It utilizes the measured data obtained from the generator and the load networks. Neither an a priori choice of an equalizer topology, nor an analytic form of the system transfer function, is assumed. The optimization process of the design procedure is carried out directly in terms of a physically realizable, unit normalized reflection coefficient which describes the equalizer atone. Based on the load-generator matching technique, a sequential procedure to design multistage microwave amplifiers is presented. An example is given for a three-stage, FET amplifier proceeding directly from the measured scattering parameters of the FET devices. The example is in three parts and illustrates the sequential method; that is, first a single-stage, then a two-stage, and finally the three-stage system is computed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25111/01131411.pdf","startPage":"2216","endPage":"2222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1982.1131411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1982.1131411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1131411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified \"Real Frequency\" Technique Applied to Broad-Band Multistage Microwave Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave amplifiers","Equalizers","Design automation","Microwave FETs","Network topology","Transfer functions","Design optimization","Process design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1131411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified \"Real Frequency\" Technique Applied to Broad-Band Multistage Microwave Amplifiers","volume":"30","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified \"Real Frequency\" Technique Applied to Broad-Band Multistage Microwave Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01131411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025535S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"25111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"159","articleId":"1131411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1131421,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The procedure utilizes the effective dielectric constant (EDC) method to determine the phase constant of the leaky modes supported by the antenna structure of finite lateral width. The radiation or leakage constant of these modes is obtained from the relatively simple boundary value problem of dielectric grating antennas of infinite width. For single-beam radiation, the practicably interesting case, the phase and leakage constants completely determine the field distribution in the antenna aperture, from which the directivity gain and radiation pattern are then calculated.

At first, formulas of tie symmetrical amplifier using lumped circuit elements are developed for the case of an idealized FET model. The theoretical analysis is then extended to distributed line elements and later to an S-parameter derived transistor model. In efforts to optimize amplifier performance, the restriction of circuit symmetry is subsequently removed and the performance characteristics of two concepts, that of equal characteristic impedances and that of equal line lengths, are proposed and compared. Based on this analysis and practical considerations, several three-link hybrid amplifiers utilizing the equal line lengths approach have been assembled and test results are reported. A gain of G = 5.5+-0.6 dB was measured over the bandwidth of 2-20 GHz. Across this frequency band a maximum VSWR of 2.2:1 for the input and 2.5:1 for the output terminaf have been reafized, while a minimum output power at the l-dB compression points of 19.3 dBm was achieved from 2-18 GHz.

Comparisons with the measured S-parameter's without and under illumination show very close agreement. Optical techniques can he used to control the gain of an FET amplifier and the frequency of an FET oscillator. Experimental results are presented showing that the gain of amplifiers can be varied up to around 20 dB and that the frequency of oscillators can be varied (tuning) around 10 percent when the optical absorbed power in the active region of the FET is varied by a few microwatts. When the laser beam is amplitude-modulated to a frequency close to the free-running FET oscillation frequency, optical injection locking can occur. An analytical expression to estimate the locking range is presented. This shows a fair agreement with the experiments. Some suggestions to improve the optical locking range are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1131611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Optical Control of GaAs MESFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Control of GaAs MESFET's","sourcePdf":"01131611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031673S","chronDate":"Oct.  1983","isNumber":"25122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"153","articleId":"1131611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1131617,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

This estimate, along with the remaining elements in the matrix above and below the band, is used to iterate to the final solution.

A new, stacked-two-dimensional-spectral-iterative-technique (SIT), presented below, does not involve the generation and inversion of a matrix and is capable of analyzing larger bodies. It is based on modeling the body by a set of planar parallel slabs and utilizing the simple (convolution-type) relationship between a current distribution on any slab and the field due to this current. This invertible relationship is conveniently formulated in the transform domain in a strictly algebraic fashion. The interactions between the various slabs are also simple and algebraic in the spectral domain. The solution is generated in an iterative manner by applying these relationships sequentially over the slabs until convergence is achieved. Discussion on convergence and numerical examples are given.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1983.1131629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"898","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1983.1131629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25123","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25123/01131629.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Frequency","Transmission line matrix methods","Slabs","Current distribution","Electromagnetic radiation","Fourier transforms","Electromagnetic scattering","Dielectric losses","Iterative methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Stacked Two-Dimensional Spectral Iterative Technique (SIT) for Analyzing Microwave Power Deposition in Biological Media","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1131629/","volume":"31","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Stacked Two-Dimensional Spectral Iterative Technique (SIT) for Analyzing Microwave Power Deposition in Biological Media","sourcePdf":"01131629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031431S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"25123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1131629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1131635,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The well known Iow-sidelobe, constant-envelope properties of MSK, very attractive in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) environment (as they limit the Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) and phase distortion) do in fact join with quite simple on-board hardware if Serial Demodulation is foreseen on-board the satellite. SMSK modems are essentially constituted by Binary PSK (BPSK) modems and particular transmitting (Conversion) and receiving (Matched) Filters. These filters represent a crucial point in the design, as they perform the proper spectrum shaping which allows exploiting the MSK capabilities. The paper presents a novel, easy technique to realise Conversion and Matched filters directly at microwave frequencies. This technique is satisfactorily applicable to medium/high bit rate SMSK systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1131910/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1985","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 1985","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Technique to Realize SMSK Conversion and Matched Filters at Microwave Frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Technique to Realize SMSK Conversion and Matched Filters at Microwave Frequencies","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01131910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043094S","chronDate":"4-6 June 1985","isNumber":"25126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5475375","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1131910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1131911,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A comparison with other power amplifiers such as IMPATTs, TWTs, and magnetrons shows that the MMIC/hybrid power amplifier has a lower phase noise level. It was found experimentally that the non-linearity operation of an amplifier and the instabilities of DC regulators are the primary sources of phase noise corruption.

The derived noise parameter estimation process, which uses a Gaussian elimination technique to predict the measured noise figure to within 0.2 dB, reduces a set of complex binomial equations to simple relationships which are easily programmable.

Power-added efficiency of 75\u00b0A (85% drain efficiency) is achieved with a 3-W HRA using GaAs FETs in the 1.7 GHz band. The operation principle is derived from a novel second-harmonic injection technique enabling purely class-B biased operation. Amplifier circuits for attaining high efficiency operation can easily be constructed with ordinary microstrip circuits. Besides, precise circuit adjustment is available to maximize the efficiency. The HRA makes high power and high efficiency microwave power amplifiers with zero quiescent current possible. Experimental test results show the feasibility of a quasi-microwave transmitting amplifier for the next generation mobile radio system. However, the HRA can be applied to radio equipment of various fields such as terrestrial microwave radio systems and satellite communications systems using microwave frequency bands.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1987.1132581","publicationTitle":"1987 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel6/8206/25129/01132581.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"966","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1987.1132581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Reaction Amplifier - A Novel High-Efficiency and High-Power Microwave Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 9 1975-June 11 1987","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Reaction Amplifier - A Novel High-Efficiency and High-Power Microwave Amplifier","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"9 May-11 June 1987","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132581/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Reaction Amplifier - A Novel High-Efficiency and High-Power Microwave Amplifier","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01132581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033951S","chronDate":"May 9 1975-June 11 1987","isNumber":"25129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8206","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1132581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1132595,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They are based on an extensive set of accurate numerical data which were generated by a rigorous spectral-domain hybrid-mode approach and are believed to represent a substantial improvement compared to the state-of-the-art and with respect to the computer-aided design of coupled microstrip filters, directional couplers, and related components.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25130/01132616.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Wide-Range Design Equations for the Frequency-Dependent Characteristic of Parallel Coupled Microstrip Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1132616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1984","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Wide-Range Design Equations for the Frequency-Dependent Characteristic of Parallel Coupled Microstrip Lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132616/","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Wide-Range Design Equations for the Frequency-Dependent Characteristic of Parallel Coupled Microstrip Lines","sourcePdf":"01132616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03182S","chronDate":"Jan 1984","isNumber":"25130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"197","articleId":"1132616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1132618,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

The simplicity and generality of the procedure, together with its excellent performance, as indicated by the results obtained, clearly shows that it is a powerful tool worth using.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25135/01132736.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1132736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inductive Posts and Diaphragms of Arbitrary Shape and Number in a Rectangular Waveguide","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Rectangular waveguides","Transmission line matrix methods","Microwave theory and techniques","Strips","Equations","Testing","Network synthesis","Waveguide components","Writing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Inductive Posts and Diaphragms of Arbitrary Shape and Number in a Rectangular Waveguide","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jun. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductive Posts and Diaphragms of Arbitrary Shape and Number in a Rectangular Waveguide","sourcePdf":"01132736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031394S","chronDate":"Jun.  1984","isNumber":"25135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1132736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1132762,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Numerical results, for these models, are obtained based on moment-method solutions of the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) with a pulse function being used as the basis for expanding the unknown internal field. In this paper, we first examine the adequacy of the moment-method procedure, with pulse basis functions, to determine SAR distributions in homogeneous models. Calculated results for the SAR distributions in some block models are presented, and the stability of the solutions is discussed. It is shown that, while the moment-method, using pulse basis functions, gives good values for whole-body average SAR, the convergence of the solutions for SAR distributions is questionable. A new technique for improving the spatial resolution of SAR distribution calculations using a different EFIE and Galerkin's method with linear basis functions and polyhedral mathematical cells is also described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1984","volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of the Cubical Block Model of Man in Calculating SAR Distributions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of the Cubical Block Model of Man in Calculating SAR Distributions","sourcePdf":"01132768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03157S","chronDate":"Aug 1984","isNumber":"25137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1132768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1132780,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

General equations for the thermoacoustic waves are derived, and the validity of the first-order linear approximation is estimated in terms of its percentage error.

The simulations establish the first-order Born approximation to be valid for objects where the product of the relative refractive index and the diameter of the cylinder is less than 0.35 lambda. The first-order Rytov approximation is valid with essentially no constraint on the size of the cylinders; however, the relative refractive index must be less than a few percent. We have also reviewed the assumptions made in the first-order Born and Rytov approximations for diffraction tomography. Further, we have reviewed the derivation of the Fourier Diffraction projection Theorem, which forms the basis of the first-order reconstruction algorithms.

This definition, however, opens the door to great kluges of waveguide bends and components which have been brazed or welded together, and that is clearly not the intent of this review. I have, therefore, limited the scope to planar integrated circuits which make use of process control manufacturing techniques for a significant portion of the integrated circuit, This would include such transmission-line techniques as stripline, rnicrostrip, slotline, finline, co-planar waveguide, and to a slightly lesser extent, lumped element circuits, image guide dielectric waveguides, and planar waveguide packages which are becoming a viable technique for integrated circuits at millimeter-wave frequencies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25138/01132812.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132812","startPage":"991","endPage":"996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Integrated Circuits - An Historical Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132812/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Integrated Circuits - An Historical Perspective","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Integrated Circuits - An Historical Perspective","sourcePdf":"01132812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039316S","chronDate":"September  1984","isNumber":"25138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1132812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1132813,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

No single point in time can be viewed as that historical moment when the idea of an MMIC was formalized; rather, the idea evolved over a period of time as a direct result of the successful development of analog and digital IC's and the push by the military services (primarily the Air Force at Wright Patterson) to apply semiconductor technology in defense systems, the evolutionary period is presented in chronological order and includes a discussion of the role played by the Molecular Electronics for Radar Applications program.

On its top were two tuning knobs, a number of binding posts, and a \"crystal.\" Following instructions, we connected an \"aerial,\" a ground wire, and a pair of earphones. The crystal itself was a piece of rock-like mineral; galena, I believe. It had a polycrystaline multifaceted surface, It was clamped in a metal cup, Facing the crystal was a pointed spring wire mounted in a ball-joint holder, designed so that the point could be placed anywhere on the surface of the crystal and be set to remain there under spring pressure. This was known as the \"cat whisker.\" Again, following instructions, with the earphones in place, Laurence searched for and found a sensitive spot, after many tries. Eureka! He could hear the nearest local radio station, faintly but clearly. We spent many hours with this receiver, not all happy. The crystal contact was erratic and the sound was always faint. We would lose the signal quite frequently, necessitating a search for a new sensitive spot on the crystal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1984","volume":"32","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Virtues of Nonlinearity - Detection, Frequency Conversion, Parametric Amplification and Harmonic Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Virtues of Nonlinearity - Detection, Frequency Conversion, Parametric Amplification and Harmonic Generation","sourcePdf":"01132821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048267S","chronDate":"September  1984","isNumber":"25138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1132821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1132833,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The number of conductors and the number of dielectrics in this analysis are arbitrary. Some of the conductors maybe of finite volume and others may be infinitesimally thin. The conductors can be either above a single ground plane or between two parallel ground planes. The formulation is obtained by using a free-space Green's function in conjunction with total charge on the conductor-to-dielectric interfaces and polarization charge on the dielectric-to-dielectric interfaces. The solution is effected by the method of moments using triangular subdomains with piecewise constant expansion functions and point matching for testing. Computed results are given for some finite-length conducting lines, compared to previous results obtained by two-dimensional analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25140/01132869.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1132869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Electrostatic Field of Conducting Bodies in Multiple Dielectric Media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatics","Conductors","Dielectrics","Circuit theory","Physics","Capacitance","Equivalent circuits","Signal design","Biographies","Indium phosphide"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1984","displayDocTitle":"The Electrostatic Field of Conducting Bodies in Multiple Dielectric Media","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Electrostatic Field of Conducting Bodies in Multiple Dielectric Media","sourcePdf":"01132869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037115S","chronDate":"Nov 1984","isNumber":"25140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"86","articleId":"1132869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1132878,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Precision measurements can now be made to generate highly accurate millimeter-wave (5 to 1/2 mm) continuous spectra on complex refractive index, complex dielectric permittivity, and loss tangent for a variety of materials such as common ceramics, semiconductors, crystalline, and glassy materials. The continuous spectra reveal an increase in dielectric loss with increase in frequency in this wavelength range for most materials. Reliable measurements also reveal that the method of preparation of nominally identical specimens can change the dielectric losses by many factors. These broad-band measurements were carried out employing dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy applied to a modular two-beam polarization interferometer.

Loss in the substrate is ignored for simplicity. A periodic boundary condition is used, and the mode analysis is done using the Green's function method. Effects of line length spacing, substrate thickness, and output impedance of gates are investigated. The \"lumped capacitance\" approximation for interconnections is shown to be inadequate for crosstalk evaluation when the circuit speed is less than 200-300 ps in LSI circuits. The result indicates that crosstalk considerations based on a transmission-line model is very important in the design of very high-speed LSI/VLSI circuits, Provisions of adjacent shield lines are shown to be significantly effective in reducing crosstalk but at the risk of dynamic ringing and at the sacrifice of wiring capacity. A shielded multilevel interconnect scheme is proposed for reduction of crosstalk without reduction of wiring capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25141/01132920.pdf","startPage":"1715","endPage":"1720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1132920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Crosstalk in Very High-Speed LSI/VLSI's Using a Coupled Multiconductor MIS Microstrip Line Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupled mode analysis","Crosstalk","Large scale integration","Very large scale integration","Microstrip","Integrated circuit interconnections","Wiring","Metal-insulator structures","Boundary conditions","Green's function methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1984","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Crosstalk in Very High-Speed LSI/VLSI's Using a Coupled Multiconductor MIS Microstrip Line Model","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Crosstalk in Very High-Speed LSI/VLSI's Using a Coupled Multiconductor MIS Microstrip Line Model","sourcePdf":"01132920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051496S","chronDate":"Dec 1984","isNumber":"25141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"42","articleId":"1132920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1132934,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In this approach, the spurious, nonphysical solutions do not appear anywhere above the \"air-line,\" and therefore the present formulation is very useful for the analysis of the surface-wave modes of dielectric waveguides. The application of this improved finite-element method to the dielectric waveguides with perfect electric and magnetic conductors is also discussed. In particular, the discussion is how to use the conditions on a boundary surface of a perfect electric or magnetic conductor whose normal direction is not coincident with the direction of a coordinate axis. Application of these boundary conditions for perfect conductors to the dielectric waveguides with planes of symmetry reduces the matrix size. The strength of this approach to boundary conditions is not just the economical use of computer memory but the elimination of spurious solutions through rigorous enforcement of boundary conditions as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Finite-Element Formulation in Terms of the Magnetic Field Vector for Dielectric Waveguides","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1985.1132985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25144/01132985.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1985.1132985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1132985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1132985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"Improved Finite-Element Formulation in Terms of the Magnetic Field Vector for Dielectric Waveguides","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Mar. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Finite-Element Formulation in Terms of the Magnetic Field Vector for Dielectric Waveguides","sourcePdf":"01132985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041318S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"25144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"96","articleId":"1132985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1132996,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

A flange-mounted waveguide is considered, the flange being pressed on an unknown material which may be of finite or infinite thickness. The relationship linking the reflection coefficient to the dielectric properties is obtained from a theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the aperture. The theory includes the effects of both cross polarization and higher order modes. An integral equation is obtained, the kernel of which is the dyadic Green function in each medium. The method of characteristic modes is used for the numerical computation. The theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental measurements.

Due to the special geometry and the chosen excitation, the problem treated is a two-dimensional one.

The planar approach overcomes the limitations inherent to the more conventional transmission-line approach.

In such cases, one-dimensional analyses give inaccurate or even erroneous results. The analysis of planar elements is formulated in terms of an N-port circuit and results in a generalized impedance-matrix description.

In this paper, a variational formulation of the skin-effect problem for calculating the losses as well as the inner inductances of components in such circuits will be described, and the first numerical results of the method will be discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1985.1133172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25151/01133172.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1985.1133172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Skin-Effect at High Frequencies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133172/","displayDocTitle":"The Skin-Effect at High Frequencies","volume":"33","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Skin-Effect at High Frequencies","sourcePdf":"01133172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053948S","chronDate":"Oct 1985","isNumber":"25151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1133172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133183,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.E.

The coupling coefficient of the system is assumed to be slowly varying with position. The set of coupled equations is transformed into a form for which the method of characteristics applies. Instead of numerically integrating the coupled equations, we decouple the equations by writing the solution in the form of a perturbational series. The resulting zeroth-order term corresponds to the inverse transform of the WKB approximation in the frequency domain, which contains only the wavefront and amplitude information. The higher order terms can be directly interpreted as reflections along the lines. Causality is satisfied to all orders. This method has the advantage of easier implementation, and is more versatile than frequency-domain methods as well as the brute-force numerical integration of the coupled partial differential equations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1985.1133183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25152/01133183.pdf","endPage":"1130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Perturbational Analysis of Nonuniformly Coupled Transmission Lines","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1985.1133183","startPage":"1120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Perturbational Analysis of Nonuniformly Coupled Transmission Lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133183/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Perturbational Analysis of Nonuniformly Coupled Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"01133183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031347S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"25152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1133183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133191,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

The major sources of gain compression and intermodulation distortion are identified. Based on the developed nonlinear analysis in conjunction with the device nonlinear model, a systematic procedure for designing a MESFET amplifier under large-signal conditions for optimum output power and IM/sub 3/ performance is proposed. The method utilizes out of band computed matching compensation through a nonlinear model of the amplifier.

Comparative measurements were made as function of time for 30 min prior to euthanasia and for 90-min post-mortem on the pia, the dura (both normal and anoxic), and in grey and white matter. All measurements were performed at 2450 MHz using a probe of diameter comparable to a 16-gauge hypodermic needle. Both conductivity and dielectric constant gradually decrease with time following CaCl/sub 2/ or KCI injection; however, following CaCl/sub 2/ induced cardiac arrest, values increased transiently upon injection, with subsequent decrease similar to KCI euthanasia. This indicates that the CaCl/sub 2/ injection causes a stronger and more abrupt change in blood flow to the brain, as expected from the different mechanisms by which the K/sup +/ and Ca/sup 2+/ ions cause cardiovascular arrest. Values of dielectric properties in homogenized brain--containing all tissue types--lay within the range of values recorded for different tissue types. Lower values for deeper tissue (white matter) reflect the reduced blood flow in comparison to that of the cortex (grey matter) and possible tissue differences. These regional differences are significant in determining absorption patterns for microwave exposure of the head.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25154/01133278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25154","startPage":"38","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In Situ Permittivity of Canine Brain: Regional Variations and Postmortem Changes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"In Situ Permittivity of Canine Brain: Regional Variations and Postmortem Changes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In Situ Permittivity of Canine Brain: Regional Variations and Postmortem Changes","sourcePdf":"01133278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040158S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"25154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1133278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133282,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Ren Chen","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuan Ren Chen","id":"37087294614"},{"name":"Kwo Ray Chu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kwo Ray Chu","id":"37087200275"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1133282","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gyrotrons","Cyclotrons","Electrostatics","Noise level","Electromagnetic radiation","Circuit noise","Electron beams","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic waveguides","Masers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133282","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25154/01133282.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of a Noise Amplification Mechanism in Gryrotrons","abstract":"The electrostatic cyclotron instability driven by a relativistic mechanism is analyzed with a small-signal theory and is shown to be a significant noise amplification mechanism in gyrotrons.

The reactance cancellation is obtained by terminating the stripline/microstrip tine exciting the slot in a short-circuited stub. The structure under this condition forms a transition between stripline/microstrip line and a waveguide.

A coupled microstrip slotline is one of them. Its application to various circuit elements has often been discussed. But the coupled microstrip slotline is essentially three-dimensional structure, so the analysis demands a rigorous three-dimensional treatment. Also, the recent high-speed pulse technique demands analysis in the time domain. The present paper treats a directional coupler using the coupled microstrip slotline in three-dimensional space and time. The results of the directional coupler analysis is presented with the complicated time variation of the three-dimensional electromagnetic field. So, the mechanism of the directional coupling phenomena that is produced by the propagation characteristics of the even and odd modes is presented in the time domain, In particular, the instantaneous diagram of the Poynting vector details the energy flow in the transient process. For the analysis of the characteristics of the complex microwave device, these results present the utilities of the various field distributions that are obtained by the three-dimensional vector analysis in the time domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Analysis of a Directional Coupler Using a Coupled Mlcrostrip Slot Line in Three-Dimensional Space (Short Paper)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133344","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25156/01133344.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1986","displayDocTitle":"Transient Analysis of a Directional Coupler Using a Coupled Mlcrostrip Slot Line in Three-Dimensional Space (Short Paper)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Mar 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Analysis of a Directional Coupler Using a Coupled Mlcrostrip Slot Line in Three-Dimensional Space (Short Paper)","sourcePdf":"01133344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035857S","chronDate":"Mar 1986","isNumber":"25156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1133344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133357,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Significant changes were observed with phase changes of 30\u00b0 and relative amplitude changes of 20 percent. The theoretical predictions qualitatively agree with the experimental results reported for simple phantoms.

The ability of a concentric-ring array to move a focal region along the central axis of the transducer is well known. Less well known is the ability of such an array to produce variable diameter annular (or ring) focal regions. Such focal rings can be effective in heating some tumors if directed around the tumor periphery. These focal rings have been produced in the past by fixed annular focus lenses, or effectively by mechanical scanning of \"point\" focus ultrasonic transducers. Production of these focal rings by a concentric-ring phased array has the advantage of allowing the focal ring diameter and focal length to be easily changed and scanned by phasing providing much greater heating flexibility. However, under some conditions such arrays produce very large secondary focus effects along the central axis of the amay. Concentric-ring arrays can also provide only patterns of circular symmetry. These problems can be partially solved by dividing the disk of the array into sectors. By appropriate phasing of the sectors, the intensity along the central axis can be greatly reduced. Moreover, appropriate phasing of the rings and sectors can produce patterns that are circularly asymmetric. By controlling these asymmetries, nonspherical tumors can be heated more optimally. Power absorption patterns in Iossy media for this class of applicators are analyzed numerically allowing a quantitative evaluation of both advantages and limitations of this approach. A thermal model based on the bioheat equation is also used to predict temperature distributions in volumes where important thermal parameters, particularly blood flow, are varied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concentric-Ring and Sector-Vortex Phased-Array Applicators for Ultrasound Hyperthermia","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25158/01133390.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25158","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1986","displayDocTitle":"Concentric-Ring and Sector-Vortex Phased-Array Applicators for Ultrasound Hyperthermia","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concentric-Ring and Sector-Vortex Phased-Array Applicators for Ultrasound Hyperthermia","sourcePdf":"01133390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039216S","chronDate":"May 1986","isNumber":"25158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"165","articleId":"1133390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133414,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The uniqueness of this approach is that we develop time-domain Green's functions for the multiport transmission-line systems by terminating the ports in quasi-matched loads. This ensures Green's functions of a short duration. Hence, the amount of frequency-domain data necessary to obtain time-domain Green's functions is modest. These Green's functions are then convolved with the line port voltages. With this technique one can analyze responses of multiconductor transmission lines with arbitrary nonlinear loads (even with memory) as we have at any instant of time Th\u00e9venin's equivalent of the linear portion of the system. An example is presented to illustrate the application of this technique to multiconductor nonlinearly loaded transmission lines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133414/","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Lossy Transmission Lines with Arbitrary Nonlinear Terminal Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Lossy Transmission Lines with Arbitrary Nonlinear Terminal Networks","sourcePdf":"01133414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043882S","chronDate":"Jun  1986","isNumber":"25159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"154","articleId":"1133414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133416,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

The fields within the dielectric-loaded region are postulated as the superposition of hybrid, TE, or TM modes of the infinite dielectric-loaded waveguide, while the fields in the end regions of the resonators are described by the superposition of the normal modes of a homogeneously filled waveguide. Numerical results are presented which reveal that accurate representation of the fields in the resonant structure generally require several modes. Hence, the resonant modes cannot be correlated directly with single waveguide modes. A new method for mode identification is proposed. For a wide range of parameters, the resonant frequencies, mode charts, field expansion coefficients, field intensity, and distributions are presented.

Both the first- and higher order ordinary elements, as well as singular and infinite elements, are used to solve for the potential and field distributions in the cross section of the line. Next, the cross-sectional field distribution is inserted in a variational expression to compute the capacitance per unit length of the line, and the effective permittivity and characteristic impedance of the line are obtained from the capacitance value. A perturbational approach is developed for estimating the losses due to conductor and dielectric dissipation and computing the attenuation constant. Both the upper and lower bounds for the capacitance and the characteristic impedance are found by solving the original and the corresponding dual problem. Lines treatable by this method may contain an arbitrary number of arbitrarily shaped conductors, including a system of conductors placed either above a single ground plane or between two parallel ground planes, and inhomogeneous dielectric regions that can be approximated Iocally by a number of homogeneous subregions. The results obtained using the finite-element procedure have been compared for various types of microwave transmission lines and have been found to agree well with available theoretical and measured data.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25164/01133505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25164","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-TEM Analysis of Microwave Transmission Lines by the Finite-Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-TEM Analysis of Microwave Transmission Lines by the Finite-Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-TEM Analysis of Microwave Transmission Lines by the Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"01133505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037375S","chronDate":"Nov 1986","isNumber":"25164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"95","articleId":"1133505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133506,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Dispersion characteristic examples are calculated for structures suitable for millimeter-wave and optical integrated circuits, such as dielectric image lines, shielded dielectric waveguides, insulated image guides, ridge guides, and inverted strip, channel, strip-slab, and indiffused inverted ridge guides. The numerical examples are verified by results available from other methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25164/01133506.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1986.1133506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Difference Analysis of Rectangular Dielectric Waveguide Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133506/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Difference Analysis of Rectangular Dielectric Waveguide Structures","volume":"34","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Difference Analysis of Rectangular Dielectric Waveguide Structures","sourcePdf":"01133506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052057S","chronDate":"Nov 1986","isNumber":"25164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"139","articleId":"1133506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133508,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The model consists of two identical transformation networks and n single-transmission-line models. The transformation networks are realized with linear time-invariant voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS's) and current-controlled current sources (CCCS's) only. A simplified model designed to simulate connections on multilayer printed circuit boards is also presented. In this case, the coupling model is adequately described by a capacitance matrix C and an inductance matrix L that are Toeplitz, symmetric, and tridiagonal. The particular structure of C and L makes the computation of the parameters of the transformation network extremely easy and efficient because only simple function evaluations (cosines) are required. Furthermore, the transformation network depends only on the number of coupled lines and not on the parameters of those lines. Therefore, a library of such models needs to be determined only once, and only the characteristic impedances and time delays for the single lines have to be recomputed. The simulation results have been compared against expermental results, and the difference between the two is less than 1 percent.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25167/01133615.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Simulation of n Coupled Transmission Lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Simulation of n Coupled Transmission Lines","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Simulation of n Coupled Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"01133615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033669S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"97","articleId":"1133615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133618,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

This analysis accounts for the correlation of the downconverted components of the time-varying hot-electron noise in the series resistance, and is thus accurate even for cryogenically cooled mixers operated at submillimeter wavelengths. This paper shows that the terms of the series-resistance noise correlation matrix are functions of the Fourier coefficients of the squared diode current F(I/sup 2/) rather than the square of the Fourier coefficients of the diode current [F(I)]/sup 2/, as has been previously presented in the literature. The analysis is used to evaluate the optimization of cryogenic mixer diodes. It is shown that minimization of the diode's I-V slope parameter V/sub 0/ is more critical than reduction of the parasitic elements for millimeter-wavelength operation, while at frequencies above 600 GHz (Lambda<0.5 mm), the junction capacitance is the most crucial parameter. Experimental results from several research groups working with a variety of mixers are presented to substantiate these results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25167/01133618.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Millimeter-And Submillimeter-Wavelength Mixer Diodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schottky diodes","Semiconductor diodes","Frequency","Capacitance","Semiconductor device noise","Mixers","Circuit noise","Light emitting diodes","Gallium arsenide","Time series analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Millimeter-And Submillimeter-Wavelength Mixer Diodes","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimization of Millimeter-And Submillimeter-Wavelength Mixer Diodes","sourcePdf":"01133618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044905S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"25167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1133618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133620,"authors":[{"name":"M.

At present, two of the most promising methods in terms of numerical efficiency are the fast-Fourier-transform conjugate gradient method (FFT-CGM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method. In this paper, these two methods are compared with respect to their ability to solve the 2-D Iossy dielectric cylinder problem for both the TM and TE incident polarizations. Substantial errors are found in the FFT-CGM solutions for the TE case. The source of these errors is explained and a modified method is developed which, although inefficient, alleviates the problem and illuminates the difficulties encountered in applying the pulse-basis method of moments to biological problems. In contrast, the FD-TD method is found to yield excellent solutions for both polarizations. This, coupled with the numerical efficiency of the FD-TD method, suggests that it is superior to the FFT-CGM for biological problems.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25169/01133660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25169","startPage":"383","endPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the FFT Conjugate Gradient Method and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for the 2-D Absorption Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the FFT Conjugate Gradient Method and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for the 2-D Absorption Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Apr 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the FFT Conjugate Gradient Method and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for the 2-D Absorption Problem","sourcePdf":"01133660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075411S","chronDate":"Apr 1987","isNumber":"25169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"71","articleId":"1133660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133665,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Compared to the broadly used Lagrangian interpolation FEM, the Hermitian FEM has the following advantages 1) a significant reduction of the matrix order needed to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunction; 2) smooth axial components (E/sub z/ or H/sub z/) and continuous transverse field components; 3) low-cost refinement of the mesh near nonconvex corners of the waveguide. These advantages are illustrated by comparing the FEM, with Hermitian polynomials solution, to other solutions for rectangular and ridged waveguides.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25176/01133801.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Finite Element Method for Nonconvex Waveguide Based on Hermitian Polynomials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133801/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Finite Element Method for Nonconvex Waveguide Based on Hermitian Polynomials","volume":"35","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Finite Element Method for Nonconvex Waveguide Based on Hermitian Polynomials","sourcePdf":"01133801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04921S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"25176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1133801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1133802,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

From the de-embedded device scattering parameters, the change in the small-signal, lumped-element equivalent circuit model is computed. These results are compared and contrasted with those of a GaAs MESFET. Lastly, three potential applications of an optically controlled AIGaAs/GaAs HEMT are demonstrated: microwave amplifier gain control, detection, and mixing with an optically coupled local oscillator signal. Preliminary experiments on the optical control of a monolithic GaAs distributed amplifier are also presented. Measurements on a HEMT show that the tight-induced voltage is 0.57 V and the increase in the drain current is 5 mA under 1.7 mW optical power at 0.83 \u00b5m. Further, the increase in magnitude of S/sub 21/ with illumination ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 dB as V/sub gs/ takes discrete values between -0.5 and -0.95 V. However, the phase of S/sub 21/ is insensitive to optical illumination. The HEMT as a photodetector has an external quantum efficiency greater than 500 percent and a dark noise current of 27 pA//spl radic/Hz.

Both the measured and the modeled small-signal performance are presented. Measured power handling performance and switching speed data are also presented. The 20-40 GHz switch uses a combination of shunt FET's and quarter-wave transformers. Better than 2 dB insertion loss and 25 dB isolation have been achieved. The dc-40 GHZ switch uses a combination of series and shunt FET's. Better than 3 dB insertion loss and 23 dB isolation have been achieved. A simplified switchhg FET model is used to adequately model switch performance. It is demonstrated that parasitic \"off\" state resistance is an important FET characteristic for broad-band switch design. The switches use MESFET's with the same characteristics as an existing millimeter-wave amplifier to allow for ease of future integration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25177/01133879.pdf","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-40 GHz and 20-40 GHz MMIC SPDT Switches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Switches","FETs","Switching circuits","Q factor","Transformers","Impedance","Insertion loss","Topology","Bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec  1987","displayDocTitle":"DC-40 GHz and 20-40 GHz MMIC SPDT Switches","volume":"35","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-40 GHz and 20-40 GHz MMIC SPDT Switches","sourcePdf":"01133879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041456S","chronDate":"Dec  1987","isNumber":"25177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1133879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1133880,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The circuit design utilizes five HEMT transistors of varying width with gates fabricated by E-beam lithography. The same amplifier fabricated with 0.35-\u00b5m-gate-length MESFET's in place of the HEMT devices resulted in 9.5+-0.5 dB of gain across the 2-20 GHz band. This record performance Ievel, for a MESFET distributed amplifier is used to determine that the use of HEMT devices rather than the small gate lengths is primarily responsible for the HEMT amplifier performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","Distributed amplifiers","MESFETs","Gain","Noise figure","Semiconductor process modeling","Circuit synthesis","Gallium arsenide","MODFETs","Transconductance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25177/01133880.pdf","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-20 GHz High-Gain Monolithic HEMT Distributed Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 2-20 GHz High-Gain Monolithic HEMT Distributed Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1133880/","volume":"35","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-20 GHz High-Gain Monolithic HEMT Distributed Amplifier","sourcePdf":"01133880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12233S","chronDate":"Dec 1987","isNumber":"25177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1133880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1133881,"authors":[{"name":"Kems-Gwor Wang","affiliation":["Torrance Research Center, Hughes Aircraft Company, Torrance, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kems-Gwor Wang","id":"37087672953"},{"name":"Shing-Kuo Wang","affiliation":["Torrance Research Center, Hughes Aircraft Company, Torrance, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shing-Kuo Wang","id":"37087510060"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1133881","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Gain","Microwave FETs","Integrated circuit yield","Ion implantation","Microwave integrated circuits","Microwave FET integrated circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1133881","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1987.1133881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25177/01133881.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-of-the-Art Ion-Implanted Low-Noise GaAs MESFET's and High-Performance Monolithic Amplifiers","abstract":"State-of-the-art GaAs Iow-noise MESFET's and high-performance monolithic amplifiers have been fabricated using a high-yield, planar ion-implantation process.

Variable-length chromosomes (strings) and their genes (parameters) have been used for encoding the problem. The crossover operation exchanges partial chromosomes (partial routes) at positionally independent crossing sites and the mutation operation maintains the genetic diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm can cure all the infeasible chromosomes with a simple repair function. Crossover and mutation together provide a search capability that results in improved quality of solution and enhanced rate of convergence. This paper also develops a population-sizing equation that facilitates a solution with desired quality. It is based on the gambler ruin model; the equation has been further enhanced and generalized. The equation relates the size of the population, quality of solution, cardinality of the alphabet, and other parameters of the proposed algorithm. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm exhibits a much better quality of solution (route optimality) and a much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms. The results are relatively independent of problem types for almost all source-destination pairs. Furthermore, simulation studies emphasize the usefulness of the population-sizing equation. The equation scales to larger networks. It is felt that it can be used for determining an adequate population size in the SP routing problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7484685","htmlLink":"/document/1134124/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for shortest path routing problem and the sizing of populations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for shortest path routing problem and the sizing of populations","sourcePdf":"01134124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094194S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"25185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"380","xplore-issue":"25185","articleId":"1134124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134125,"authors":[{"name":"Kuk-Hyun Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/25185/1134125/1134125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuk-Hyun Han received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1997 and 1999, respectively, from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science.","His research interests are in the areas of quantum-inspired evolutionary computation, internet-based personal robot systems and intelligent control.","Mr. Han was the recipient of the Presidential Award at the 38th Nationwide Science Exhibition in 1992, the Certificate of Appreciation at the 1996 Micro-Robot World Cup Soccer Tournament (MiroSot'96), the runner-up Awards at S-MiroSot'97 and 2001 FIRA Cup China, and the Bronze Prize at the 7th Samsung HumanTech Thesis Competition in 2001."]},"lastName":"Kuk-Hyun Han","id":"37277953700"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/25185/1134125/1134125-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Hwan Kim received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 1981, 1983 and 1987, respectively.","Since 1988, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, where he is currently a Professor.

Like other evolutionary algorithms, QEA is also characterized by the representation of the individual, evaluation function, and population dynamics. However, instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, QEA uses a Q-bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation and a Q-bit individual as a string of Q-bits. A Q-gate is introduced as a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, experiments were carried out on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The results show that QEA performs well, even with a small population, without premature convergence as compared to the conventional genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7484686","htmlLink":"/document/1134125/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for a class of combinatorial optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for a class of combinatorial optimization","sourcePdf":"01134125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10633S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"25185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"926","xplore-issue":"25185","articleId":"1134125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1134130,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We show that the accuracy of the measurements affects the accuracy of the capacity estimation when using the Shannon formula. We study analytically how the channel estimation error appears in the capacity formula, and we derive mathematical expressions for the first- and second-order approximations of the error.

Currently, the polishing physics is not well defined though it is known that the nature of the process makes particle removal after CMP difficult and necessary. It is important to understand the particle adhesion mechanisms resulting from the polishing process and the effect-of the adhering force on particle removal in post-CMP cleaning processes. In this paper, strong particle adhesion is shown to be caused by chemical reactions (after initial hydrogen bonding) that take place in the presence of moisture and long aging time. In particle removal using brush cleaning, contact between the particle and the brush is essential to the removal of submicron particles. In noncontact mode, 0.1-/spl mu/m particle can hardly be removed when the brush is more than 1 /spl mu/m away from the particle. While in full contact mode, removal is possible for a 0.1-/spl mu/m particle at the investigated brush rotational speeds. The experimental data shows that high removal efficiency (low number of defects) is possible with a high brush pressure and a short cleaning time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2002.804872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25181","startPage":"374","endPage":"382","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/25181/01134149.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle adhesion and removal mechanisms in post-CMP cleaning processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1134149/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle adhesion and removal mechanisms in post-CMP cleaning processes","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","accessionNumber":"7499038","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle adhesion and removal mechanisms in post-CMP cleaning processes","sourcePdf":"01134149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04777S","chronDate":"Nov 2002","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"25181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"25181","articleId":"1134149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1134178,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These bounds are validated using experimental data from a 118-182-kHz sonar, showing an accuracy of the order of 20 microns on the ping-to-ping cross-track displacements. Next, the accuracy required on the DPCA sway and yaw in order to achieve a given synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) beampattern specification, specified by the expected SAS array gain, is computed as a function of the number P of pings in the SAS. Higher accuracy is required when P increases to counter the accumulation of errors during the integration of the elementary ping-to-ping estimates: the standard deviation must decrease as P/sup -1/2/ for the DPCA sway and P/sup -3/2/ for the yaw. Finally, by combining the above results, the lower bounds on DPCA micronavigation accuracy are established. These bounds set an upper limit to the SAS length achievable in practice. The maximum gain Q in cross-range resolution achievable by a DPCA micronavigated SAS is computed as a function of the key SAS parameters.

The use of analytical models allows one to reduce significantly the number of free parameters of the theory and to elucidate the main physical mechanisms that are responsible for interface-trap and oxide-trap formation processes. We found that the hole trapping in the oxide cannot be responsible for all the enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS) effects in SiO/sub 2/, and the contribution of protons is also essential. The dynamics of interface-trap formation are defined by the relation between the proton mobility (transport time of the protons across the oxide) and the time required for positive-charge buildup near the interface due to trapped holes. The analytically estimated and numerically calculated interface-trap densities were found to be in very good agreement with available experimental data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","volume":"49","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"7585099","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1134199/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Physical model for enhanced interface-trap formation at low dose rates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical model for enhanced interface-trap formation at low dose rates","sourcePdf":"01134199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091898S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134200,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In addition to the usual dependencies on channel length and gate bias transition time, the geometric component was found to increase with radiation-induced oxide-trapped charge density and decreasing temperature. A postirradiation injection of electrons into the gate oxide reduces the geometric component along with the density of oxide-trapped charge, which clearly demonstrates that the two are correlated. A fit of the injection data to a first-order model for trapping kinetics indicates that the electron trapping occurs predominantly at a single type of Coulomb-attractive trap site. The geometric component results primarily from the bulk recombination of channel electrons that fail to transport to the source or drain during the transition from inversion to accumulation. The radiation response of these transistors suggests that Coulomb scattering by oxide-trapped charge increases the bulk recombination at low temperatures by impeding electron transport. These results imply that the geometric component must be properly accounted for when charge pumping irradiated n-channel MOSFETs at low temperatures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1134201/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7585101","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Geometric component of charge pumping current in nMOSFETs due to low-temperature irradiation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric component of charge pumping current in nMOSFETs due to low-temperature irradiation","sourcePdf":"01134201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112972S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1134202,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

At least two kinds of defects can contribute to the noise of unirradiated and irradiated devices. The first is a \"dimer\" vacancy associated with the E/sub /spl delta//' center, which is shown by DFT to be a metastable electron trap when the Si-Si spacing is stretched beyond its equilibrium value, as likely can occur in strained SiO/sub 2/ near the Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface. The second is a neutral or positively charged E/spl gamma/' center, which has two configurations. One is puckered (one of the Si atoms relaxes through its local bonding plane) and forms a dipole after electron capture (E(/spl gamma//sup 4/)'). The other is shown via DFT to be a different kind of puckered configuration, including a fivefold coordinated Si (E(/spl gamma//sup 5/)'); this does not form a dipole. These results strongly suggest a common model of charge exchange with O vacancies can account for much of the oxide-trap charge and 1/f noise in MOS devices. Applying this model to thermally stimulated current (TSC) experiments suggests hole emission in TSC may well be due to the thermal relaxation of a puckered E/spl gamma/' into a dimer E/sub /spl delta//'. This can explain literature discrepancies between optical and thermal estimates of trapped-hole energies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","volume":"49","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7594256","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1134203/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unified model of hole trapping, 1/f noise, and thermally stimulated current in MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified model of hole trapping, 1/f noise, and thermally stimulated current in MOS devices","sourcePdf":"01134203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.253267S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1134204,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Very high carrier density can be achieved in these systems due to the strong piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of the nitrides. The device was grown by molecular beam epitaxy and magnetron sputtering epitaxy. Through resistivity and Hall effect measurements in the temperature range 2 K to 300 K, its 2DEG conductive character, high mobility, and carrier density properties were confirmed. The effects of 2-MeV proton radiation on these properties are reported for the fluence range 1 /spl times/ 10/sup 13/ to 7 /spl times/ 10/sup 15/ cm/sup -2/. As a result of irradiation, the carrier density decreases by a factor of two whereas the mobility degrades by about a factor of a thousand. A fluence between 3 /spl times/ 10/sup 14/ cm/sup -2/ and 3 /spl times/ 10/sup 15/ cm/sup -2/ is necessary to drive a conductor to insulator transition for this 2-D gas and the change of phase is attributed mainly to changes in the mobility. This change of phase is determined by quantum conditions and could be used to establish an absolute standard for radiation damage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7585106","htmlLink":"/document/1134207/","displayDocTitle":"Transport properties of proton-irradiated gallium nitride-based two-dimensional electron-gas system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transport properties of proton-irradiated gallium nitride-based two-dimensional electron-gas system","sourcePdf":"01134207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044626S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1134208,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Experiments performed on capacitors show a very strong bias and oxide thickness dependence for charge collection. In combination with three-dimensional (3-D) simulations, these data suggest that the mechanism for charge collection in capacitors is due to perturbation of the substrate electric fields by charge deposition in the substrate. For substrates biased in depletion, these perturbations induce displacement currents through the oxide. Charge collection by displacement currents can be substantially reduced or mitigated by using heavily doped substrates. Experiments performed on SRAMs also show enhanced charge collection from displacement currents. However, experimental data and 3-D simulations show that for SRAMs, a second mechanism also contributes to charge collection. The 3-D simulations suggest that the charge collection results from drain and body-tie heavy-ion strikes within a few tenths of a micron of the body-to-drain junctions. These charge collection mechanisms can substantially reduce the SEU hardness and soft-error reliability of commercial SOI ICs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge collection in SOI capacitors and circuits and its effect on SEU hardness","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2002.805429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/25186/01134244.pdf","startPage":"2937","endPage":"2947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2002.805429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1134244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Charge collection in SOI capacitors and circuits and its effect on SEU hardness","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1134244/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7585133","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge collection in SOI capacitors and circuits and its effect on SEU hardness","sourcePdf":"01134244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078369S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1134245,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Two main parameters are considered. First, the thickness of the silicon film, which determines the fully or partially depleted state of SOI devices. This parameter strongly influences the parasitic bipolar, which amplifies the radiation-generated charge. In particular, fully depleted devices show a low bipolar gain due to a high-impact ionization. Secondly, the doping profile in the drain region, which varies with process optimization. The trend is to use shallow junctions to reduce short-channel effects in partially depleted devices. Shallow-drain junctions in partially depleted devices contribute to increases in drain-region sensitivity. As a result, fully depleted architectures are more adapted to reduce the radiation sensitivity of future SOI technologies, because it both reduces the bipolar amplification and the sensitivity of the drain region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insights on the transient response of fully and partially depleted SOI technologies under heavy-ion and dose-rate irradiations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2002.805439","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/25186/01134245.pdf","startPage":"2948","endPage":"2956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2002.805439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1134245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Insights on the transient response of fully and partially depleted SOI technologies under heavy-ion and dose-rate irradiations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1134245/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7594266","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insights on the transient response of fully and partially depleted SOI technologies under heavy-ion and dose-rate irradiations","sourcePdf":"01134245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074819S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134246,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This degradation in breakdown increases with increasing ion linear energy transfer (LET), increasing ion fluence, and decreasing oxide thickness. The reliability degradation due to high-energy ion-induced latent defects is explained by a simple percolation model of conduction through SiO/sub 2/ layers with irradiation and/or electrical stress-induced defects. Monitoring the gate-leakage current reveals the presence of latent defects in the dielectric films. These results may be significant to future single-event effects and single-event gate rupture tests for MOS devices and ICs with ultrathin gate oxides.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2002.805389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/25186/01134259.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2002.805389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term reliability degradation of ultrathin dielectric films due to heavy-ion irradiation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1134259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Long-term reliability degradation of ultrathin dielectric films due to heavy-ion irradiation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134259/","volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1134259/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7585146","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term reliability degradation of ultrathin dielectric films due to heavy-ion irradiation","sourcePdf":"01134259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072416S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1134260,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Existing models for charge loss from charged FG and generation-recombination after a heavy ion strike are insufficient to justify (or in contrast with) our experimental results. In particular, the charge loss is by far larger than predicted by existing models, it depends on the number of generated holes, not on those surviving recombination, and it is larger for FGs with larger threshold voltage before irradiation. We show that these data can be explained as the effect of two different mechanisms. The first one is a semi-permanent multi trap-assisted tunneling (TAT), which closely resembles anomalous stress induced leakage current (SILC) in electrically stressed devices. The second mechanism is a transient phenomenon responsible for the largest part of the lost FG charge. Detailed physical modeling of this mechanism is still not available, owing to the limited knowledge of the physical background under these phenomena, but three possible models are explored and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134260/","volume":"49","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1134260/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7585147","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous charge loss from floating-gate memory cells due to heavy ions irradiation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous charge loss from floating-gate memory cells due to heavy ions irradiation","sourcePdf":"01134260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125947S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134263,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M.

The midgap and flatband voltage shifts in these devices increase linearly with dose and are significantly larger than the shifts seen in high quality, thermal SiO/sub 2/ gate oxides of similar electrical thickness. The standard trapping efficiency equation is adapted for calculating effective trapping efficiencies in alternative dielectrics and used to compare the radiation response of hafnium silicate to SiO/sub 2/ from several manufacturers. The effects of common reliability screens such as \"burn-in\" and bias stress tests are also discussed. It is shown that baking these devices can degrade their capacitance-voltage characteristics, and large applied voltages inject excess charge into the dielectric, which can lead to a misinterpretation of the radiation results. However, the radiation responses of these devices, coupled with the demonstrated resistance of these films to heavy-ion induced gate rupture in previous studies, suggest that alternative dielectrics to SiO/sub 2/ potentially could be integrated into future electronics technologies for many low-power space applications.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2002.805392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"3191","endPage":"3196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/25186/01134280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2002.805392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-dose radiation response of hafnium-silicate capacitors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Voltage","Dielectric devices","Space technology","Insulation","X-rays","Equations","Hafnium","Manufacturing","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric thin films","X-ray effects","electron traps","MOS capacitors","low-power electronics","space vehicle electronics","hafnium compounds","semiconductor device reliability","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total-dose radiation response","equivalent oxide thickness gate insulators","X-rays","midgap voltage shifts","flatband voltage shifts","electrical thickness","trapping efficiency equation","radiation response","reliability screens","burn-in","bias stress tests","capacitance-voltage characteristics","Hf/sub x/Si/sub y/O/sub z/","excess charge","radiation responses","heavy-ion induced gate rupture","low-power space applications","MOS capacitor","4.5 nm","10 keV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Total-dose radiation response of hafnium-silicate capacitors","volume":"49","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7585166","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1134280/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134280/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-dose radiation response of hafnium-silicate capacitors","sourcePdf":"01134280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127165S","chronDate":"Dec.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"25186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"25186","articleId":"1134280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134286,"authors":[{"name":"Bongim Jun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Bongim Jun","id":"37087566284"},{"name":"S.

EMC and ACC signals were simultaneously recorded while subjects (N=11) performed a predetermined sequence of tasks. Two sets of tasks were considered: identification tasks related to clinical assessment of functional independence, and non-identification tasks namely motor activities biomechanically similar to the identification tasks but not related to clinical assessment. Pattern recognition algorithms were applied to data from both sensor types. The performance criteria were sensitivity (detection of identification tasks when present), specificity (avoidance of confusing identification tasks with one another), and misclassification (avoidance of confusing non-identification tasks with identification tasks). Results indicated that mean sensitivity over all tasks was higher for accelerometers than for EMG for a given value of misclassification. However, for specific tasks, EMG sensitivity was higher than that of accelerometers. Therefore we explored whether a combination of the two sensor types would lead to a further increase in sensitivity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134383/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7581993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1134383/","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to monitor motor activities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to monitor motor activities","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1134383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039232S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8123","isNumber":"25190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"25190","articleId":"1134383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1134388,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

It is well known that the shapes of the ECG waveforms of different persons are different but it is unclear whether such differences can be used to identify different individuals. In this research, we demonstrated successfully that it is possible to identify a specific person from a group of candidates using a one-lead ECG. A one-lead ECG, unlike two-dimensional biometrics, such as the fingerprint, is a one-dimensional, low-frequency signal that can be recorded from electrodes on the hands. This research applied two techniques, template matching and a decision-based neural network (DBNN), to implement the identity verification. Using each of the two methods separately on a predetermined group of 20 subjects, the experimental results showed that the rate of correct identity verification was 95% for template matching and 80% for the DBNN. Combining the two methods produced a 100% correct rate. Our results show that ECG analysis is a potentially applicable method for human identity verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7581998","htmlLink":"/document/1134388/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"One-lead ECG for identity verification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-lead ECG for identity verification","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1134388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032588S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8123","isNumber":"25190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"25190","articleId":"1134388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1134394,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The mortality rate in the coronary artery bypass grafting database is typically less than 5%, thus the identification of non-survivors is difficult. One possible remedy to this dilemma is to artificially increase the mortality rate in the training set presented to the network during its learning phase. This method increased the likelihood that the network will recognize patterns attributable to non-survivors and improved results. To optimize the sensitivity and specificity performance of a neural network at the same time, a new performance index - the logarithmic-sensitivity index - was introduced. Its ability to identify the optimal stopping point when training with an automated network was compared with the results found when the network was optimized manually. Results show that the log-sensitivity index succeeded in finding a good balance between sensitivity and specificity of the test set and the automated results had a higher mean sensitivity although it was within the error bounds of the manual results. This means that the log-sensitivity index is a valuable timesaving tool, because the networks can be run automatically without user supervision.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1134394","pdfPath":"/iel5/8123/25190/01134394.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"75 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second Joint 24th Annual Conference and the Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society] [Engineering in Medicine and Biology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second Joint 24th Annual Conference and the Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society] [Engineering in Medicine and Biology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1134394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logarithmic-sensitivity index as a stopping criterion for automated neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Logarithmic-sensitivity index as a stopping criterion for automated neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7582002","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1134394/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logarithmic-sensitivity index as a stopping criterion for automated neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1134394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059671S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8123","isNumber":"25190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"25190","articleId":"1134394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1134432,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In fact the very idea of sending X-rays and other medical images and information electronically could not have been brought up without advances in compression technology over the past two decades. Leading compression standards, such as JPEG/MPEG and those based on Hadamard matrix, have been successfully implemented in numerous signal/image coding/decoding applications ranging from satellites to medical imaging. On the other hand, ever-increasing requirements in signal recognition and transmission, particularly related to telemedicine, have challenged the researchers to develop new compression techniques better suited for each practical situation. The wavelet technology emerged as one of the most promising tools in that direction. Both wavelet and Hadamard transform based algorithms provide excellent quality biomedical signal reconstruction at high compression ratios and can be implemented in real-time on existing microprocessors. The objective of this study is to construct hybrid Hadamard-wavelet transforms and to develop corresponding optimal zonal sampling methods with the use of such transforms. The designed hybrid transforms can be useful in various specific signal processing applications where combining properties of Hadamard and wavelet transforms may be of particular benefit.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1134432","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second Joint 24th Annual Conference and the Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society] [Engineering in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second Joint 24th Annual Conference and the Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society] [Engineering in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/8123/25190/01134432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1134432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25190","startPage":"153","endPage":"154 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New classes of hybrid Hadamard-wavelet transforms for signal-image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1134432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New classes of hybrid Hadamard-wavelet transforms for signal-image processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134432/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7603896","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1134432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New classes of hybrid Hadamard-wavelet transforms for signal-image processing","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1134432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079887S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8123","isNumber":"25190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123","xplore-issue":"25190","articleId":"1134432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1134700,"authors":[{"name":"L.

An inspection policy is suggested which combines the ideas of various sampling strategies and provides a guarantee against undesirable levels of average outgoing quality as well as protection against poor quality on a lot-to-lot basis.

The adsorption of water provides the necessary electrolyte through which ion migration and electrochemical corrosion is possible, and the surface conductivity of the adsorbed moisture layer is a direct measure of the ion migration capability. The water adsorption isotherm of or-alumina at 23\u00b0C was determined using thermo-gravimetric analysis. It is found to be of type III according to Brunauer's classification. Similar to results for other oxides, the water adsorption on\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\alpha</tex>\n-alumina is much lower than that on metal surfaces. An equivalent of one monolayer of water is adsorbed when the relative humidity (RH) is about 35 percent. For RH's higher than 70 percent, water adsorption is more than five monolayers and increases dramatically with increasing water vapor pressure. The surface conductivity was measured using an interdigitated thin-film circuit of pure copper sputtered on an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\alpha</tex>\n-alumina substrate. The results show that the conductivity of the water layer increases with the accumulation of water monolayers. A moisture film equivalent to less than five monolayers (RH less than about 70 percent) has a conductivity approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk water. At 95 percent RH, a water film of more than 20 monolayers has a conductivity which is still an order of magnitude lower than that of an equivalent film of bulk water. These results are attributed to a discontinuous or patchy nature of the water film on the surface of the substrate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134727/","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Water Adsorption and Surface Conductivity Measurements on<tex>alpha</tex>-Alumina Substrates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Water Adsorption and Surface Conductivity Measurements on<tex>alpha</tex>-Alumina Substrates","sourcePdf":"01134727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068601S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"25204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1134727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134730,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The integrated sensor with six different elements on an alumina substrate was fabricated by using thick-film techniques. The elements are kept at around 400\u00b0C by a Pt heater mounted on the sensor back. Since each element was made from different semiconductor oxides, they possess different sensitivities to material odors and the integrated sensor can develop specific patterns corresponding to each odor as a histogram of conductance ratios for each element. The microcomputer identifies the scent on the basis of similarities calculated by comparing standard patterns stored in the memory and a sample pattern developed by the integrated sensor. The scent is then quantified by using the sensor element with the highest sensitivity to the smell identified. The experimental results show that smells can be successfully identified and quantified with the electronic System.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25204/01134730.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1987.1134730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1987.1134730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1134730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smell Identification Using a Thick-Film Hybrid Gas Sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gas detectors","Microcomputers","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems","Thick film sensors","Substrates","Thermal sensors","Conducting materials","Semiconductor materials","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chemical transducers","Materials processing","Thick-film circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1987","displayDocTitle":"Smell Identification Using a Thick-Film Hybrid Gas Sensor","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smell Identification Using a Thick-Film Hybrid Gas Sensor","sourcePdf":"01134730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020689S","chronDate":"Jun 1987","isNumber":"25204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1134730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1134733,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The adhesive paste is a concentrated dispersion of silver and glass particles in an organic solvent medium.

These requirements include the assembly of high pin out (up to 500 I/O's) devices, the ability to sustain synchronous system operation at frequencies up to 100 MHz, and cooling at thermal loads greater than 1 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. A new packaging technology is described that will overcome many of the limitations of conventional packaging. The new technology has the capability for assembling devices with more than 200 I/O's, a maximum signal lead length less than 20 cm, a power and ground lead inductance less than 0.1 nH, a signal lead capacitance less than 20 pF, and a cooling capability greater than 1 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The substrate for the proposed new packaging technology is a silicon wafer. The power and ground are distributed by means of copper planes on either side of the substrate. Two signal layers are positioned above the power plane using a polyimide dielectric material. The signal leads are a minimum of 10 \u00b5m wide. With 10-\u00b5m-thick polymer, the line capacitance is ~ 1 pF/cm. Copper metallization is \u00b7 used to achieve a resistance of 10\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\Omega</tex>\n/cm for the minimum width signal leads with 2-\u00b5m-thick conductors. Devices are attached to the interconnection substrate by means of solder. The solder technology was chosen because it is repairable, provides a low-inductance (< 1 nH) connection between chip and substrate, and enables I/O pads to be positioned over the area of the chip. The matched thermal expansion coefficient between the substrate and chip results in a mechanically stable solder attachment. This new packaging technology has been demonstrated by means of a prototype vehicle. Three chips from the WE\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00ae</sup>\n32100 chip set: CPU, memory management unit (MMU), and math accelerator unit (MAU), have been flip-chip bonded and interconnected together on a 1.3 x 3.0-cm substrate. The chips have been spaced 500 \u00b5m apart. The assembly has been bonded to a metal heat sink using a compliant adhesive layer to minimize stresses in the silicon substrate. The chip-to-heat sink thermal resistance for the assembly is 5\u00b0C/W (junction to case). A 160 I/O multilayer printed wiring board package has been used to fan out from the edge of the substrate to pins on a 100-mil grid. Wire bonds electrically connect the substrate to the package and provide for chip backside grounding. A protective cover completes the package assembly. In summary, significant improvements in system performance can be achieved with the new multichip technology. Compared to conventional packaging, a factor of 3 improvement in system operating frequency is expected when IC's are designed specifically for the technology. Additionally, system size and power dissipation can be reduced by a factor of seven and 30 percent, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1987.1134788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25206/01134788.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"653","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1987.1134788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichip Packaging Design for VLSI-Based Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1987","displayDocTitle":"Multichip Packaging Design for VLSI-Based Systems","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1134788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichip Packaging Design for VLSI-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"01134788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021484S","chronDate":"December  1987","isNumber":"25206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1134788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1134799,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Onuki","affiliation":["Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Jin Onuki","id":"37352398600"},{"name":"M.

As a quantity in electronic circuits, negative mutual inductance is usually so much smaller in magnitude than overall inductance that it can be neglected with little effect.

This paper derives inductance equations for planar thin- or thick-film coils, comparing equations that include negative mutual inductance with those that do not. It describes a computer program developed for calculating inductances for both square and rectangular geometries, the variables considered being track width, space between tracks, and number of turns. Graphic results are presented for up to 16 turns over an inductance range of 3 nanohenries to 10 microhenries.

This correspondence presents a comparative bonding reliability study of aluminum ribbon wire versus round wire, and gold ribbon wire versus round wire in hybrid microcircuits. The wires were ultrasonically bonded to thick film gold, thin film aluminum, thin film chromium-gold, and thin film molybdenumgold. Results showed that ribbon wire was superior to round wire and, that after 1000 hours of high temperature storage, aluminum round wire averaged 91% bond degradation on all types of substrates, while gold ribbon wire averaged 57% degradation. The average degradation of the wires on all of the substrate types is shown below in summarized form.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1975","publicationDate":"June 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"11","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ribbon Wire Versus Round Wire Reliability for Hybrid Microcircuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ribbon Wire Versus Round Wire Reliability for Hybrid Microcircuits","sourcePdf":"01135057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014059S","chronDate":"Jun 1975","isNumber":"25224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1135057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135058,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A combined-flow equation, valid for viscous, molecular, and diffusional flow is applied to capillary leaks and the results are extended to crack-shaped leaks and orifices. It is shown that for a given leak rate the geometry with the largest viscous contribution to flow is a single long capillary. A distinction is drawn between the rate at which a package leaks during helium leak test (in vacuum) and during use (in air at one atm pressure), and it is shown that the latter may be orders of magnitude smaller than the former because of the viscous contribution to flow during test and during bombing. Two different test procedures are proposed that are designed to prevent viscous flow by avoiding differences in total pressure: one is a one-atm \"bath\" instead of a \"bomb\" in radiotracer 85Kr, the other a gas-chromatographic collection of inert halogen-bearing gas that leaks out of a prefilled package. Both are predicted to give test leak rates within a factor of two of the use leak rates. Because of its widespread use and its complexity, the Howl and Mann molecular-flow equation is examined and a number of simplifying approximations are made to allow greater ease in its use. The time rate of change of pressure in a package is calculated using the simplifying approximation that leak rate is proportional only to difference in total or partial pressure, and the concept of maximum allowable dwell time for the \"marginal gross leaker\" is developed.

Contact resistance between brush and terminal is measured as a function of the number of brush-terminal encounters. Terminal wear and static friction are measured concurrently in selected cases. Contact resistance behavior with and without lubrication by U.S.P. petrolatum, chosen after extensive corrosion tests, is studied. Sparing and copious lubrication, the effect of additives, and substitution of silver for one or both contacts, are studied. It is concluded that organic contamination or lubrication of the contacts, in conjunction with slide, lead to the development of a coherent film, probably oxide, bonded to the wear track by products developed as a result of chemical reactions induced by sliding, a process known as mechanical activation. If oxide is prevented from forming or if the products of mechanical activation are dispersed, the rate of development of an insulating film can be greatly reduced.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25229/01135124.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1976.1135124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1976.1135124","startPage":"147","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Lubrication of Sliding Base Metal Contacts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135124/","displayDocTitle":"The Lubrication of Sliding Base Metal Contacts","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Lubrication of Sliding Base Metal Contacts","sourcePdf":"01135124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031937S","chronDate":"Jun 1976","isNumber":"25229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1135124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135126,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Evaluation of the welds was determined through a 90\u00b0 peel test. From the resulting data the following conclusions were reached. 1) Parallel gap welding is a viable approach to gold ribbon interconnection to thick film. 2) In general, thicker fired films respond better to parallel gap welding. 3) Sensitivity to firing profile, as reflected by parallel gap weld strength, is a characteristic of each specific thick-film material which must be determined and properly optimized. 4) Sensitivity to weld parameters is a characteristic of each specific material and should be optimized with firing profile. 5) The Pure gold conductor materials are not as satisfactory as platinum-gold conductors for parallel gap welding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1976","publicationDate":"September 1976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"12","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Gap Welding to Thick-Film Metallization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Gap Welding to Thick-Film Metallization","sourcePdf":"01135127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034386S","chronDate":"Sep 1976","isNumber":"25230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1135127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135129,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is a simple-to-use dry process which is inexpensive to set up and operate. It can produce \u00b7 clean surfaces in air, at ambient temperatures. The experiments were performed on quartz and metal surfaces. The contaminants which were successfully removed include oils and greases (including silicones), fluxes, skin oils, and contamination adsorbed during prolonged exposure to air. The experiments were aimed at defining the variables and determining the optimum conditions for producing clean surfaces by UV irradiation. The important variables are: the contaminants initially present, the precleaning procedure, the wavelengths emitted by the UV source, the atmosphere between the source and sample, the distance between the source and' sample, and the time of exposure. For surfaces which are properly precleaned and placed within a few millimeters of an ozone-producing UV source, the process can consistently produce a clean surface in less than 1 rain. Experiments performed with two low-pressure mercury discharge UV sources, one which generates ozone and one which does not, indicate that the combination of short-wave UV light plus ozone produces a clean surface substantially faster than either short-wave UV light without ozone or ozone without UV light.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135156/","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"UV/Ozone Cleaning of Surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UV/Ozone Cleaning of Surfaces","sourcePdf":"01135156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042898S","chronDate":"Dec 1976","isNumber":"25231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"92","articleId":"1135156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135157,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Cracking during the formation of 90\u00b0 bends and the relatively poor cyclic fatigue behavior of this material are identified as due to embrittlement caused by second-phase oxide inclusions. Optical and SEM examinations of failures led to the following model for embrittlement. Under the applied loads, voids nucleate at the second-phase inclusions; continued loading causes the voids to grow and coalesce, resulting in a fracture. This model is consistent with the published literature. Cyclic fatigue behavior, i.e., the median number of cycles to failure (MCTF), was found to vary inversely with the oxygen concentration. Over the range 10-650 ppm oxygen (by weight), the fatigue results could be represented by [100/MCTF] = 0.0228 [ppm oxygen] + 8.32. For both CDA110 and oxygen-free copper (CDA102 or copper alloy no. 102) the MCTF was found to vary inversely with the percent of bond deformation over the 10-60-percent range. Therefore, all cyclic fatigue comparisons among the various CDA110 and CDA102 specimens were made at a common bond deformation, chosen to be 35 percent. Oxygen-free copper with ~10 ppm oxygen was found to have about twice the MCTF as CDA110 with ~400 ppm oxygen.","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25233/01135182.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oxygen Embrittlement of Copper Leads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1977","displayDocTitle":"Oxygen Embrittlement of Copper Leads","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oxygen Embrittlement of Copper Leads","sourcePdf":"01135182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026185S","chronDate":"Jun 1977","isNumber":"25233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1135182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135189,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The contaminants studied were residual photoresist and atmospheric contamination. For gold metallization contaminated with organic films, thermo-compression gold bonding is a two-stage process. The first stage occurs within a fraction of a second and results from the mechanical disruption of barrier films by shear displacements at the faying surface. Bonding during this initial stage is a strong function of the interface temperature, the bonding force, and the contaminant films. The second stage involves growth of the metal-metal interfaces by a sintering phenomenon. Growth of bonds by sintering also occurs in the absence of external loads though at a decreased rate. Analysis of the rate data leads to the conclusion that the growth mechanism follows a parabolic rate law and, in the absence of external loads, exhibits an activation energy of approximately 11 kcal/mole. Under high external loads, the rate of second-stage growth exhibited little temperature dependence, indicative of a stress-assisted process. Bond growth rates for the atmospherically contaminated metallization were an order of magnitude higher than that for the photoresist contaminated samples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25233/01135191.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135191","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinetics of Thermocompression Bonding to Organic Contaminated Gold Surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135191/","displayDocTitle":"Kinetics of Thermocompression Bonding to Organic Contaminated Gold Surfaces","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinetics of Thermocompression Bonding to Organic Contaminated Gold Surfaces","sourcePdf":"01135191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019528S","chronDate":"Jun 1977","isNumber":"25233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1135191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135193,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In thermal cycle tests, lead-indium was substantially mote resistant than tin-lead to fatigue resulting from chipsubstrate mismatch. The lead-indium that has been studied most extensively, 50-50 by weight, gives a 3:1 improvement in lifetime over 595 and is compatible with standard chip and substrate processing. Evaporated above a Cr-Cu-Au pad on the chip surface, the solder is eventually joined to tinned Cr--Cu lands on the ceramic substate. Because of its lower melting point, lead-indium can be joined at a lower temperature than 5-95 tin-lead. In its reactions with copper and gold, which are present in chip and/or substrate metallizations, indium resembles tin. Gold, present only as the protective top film of the chip metallization, dissolves completely during chip joining, whereas copper is present in sufficient quantity to exceed its solubility limit, and thus forms copper-indium intermetallic layers at both interfaces. To ensure terminal strength and reliability, these layers should be stable and adherent both to the solder and to the underlying metnllizations. Lead-indium has been found to be more susceptible than lead-tin to corrosion in high-humidity and hostile environments. This susceptibility must be borne in mind when lead-indium is considered for nonhermetic applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25234/01135198.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lead-Indium for Controlled-Collapse Chip Joining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1977","displayDocTitle":"Lead-Indium for Controlled-Collapse Chip Joining","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lead-Indium for Controlled-Collapse Chip Joining","sourcePdf":"01135198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022534S","chronDate":"Sep 1977","isNumber":"25234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1135198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135204,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The HMC's consist of sputtered tantalum-nitride (Ta\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nN) resistors and evaporated chromium-gold (Cr-Au) conductors on alumina substrates with applique components and thermocompression bonded ribbons, lead frames, fine wires, and beam lead devices. During recent testing of HMC's for a new program, failures of the BLD's resulted in unacceptable yields and increased rework. These BLD failures showed up primarily as increased leakage failures, intermittent failures that repeated on a random basis, and in worst cases, as direct device shorts. An investigation of the problem showed that cracks often appear on the edge of the silicon and on the silicon nitride lip that overhangs the edge of the beam. These cracks appear at various phases of the processing, but primarily during BLD bonding. High temperature reverse bias (HTRB) tests of diodes and transistors combined with analysis of the devices that failed during these tests indicated that gold in the cracks was a primary cause of failures. The gold in the cracks is the result of gold \"relocation\" or migration from the gold beams on the semiconductor. The gold was detected by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and electron-beam induced-current methods. Gold was observed on the silicon cracks above the beams and in silicon nitride cracks on either side of the beams. Gold resistive leakage paths of this type have been observed only in devices such as p-n-p transistors and p+ silicon substrate zener diodes, where one of the gold beams is more than 1.42 V positive with respect to the body of the silicon chip. This indicates that the gold leakage paths are formed by electromigration of gold from the beam to the silicon chip. Results of HTRB tests on n-p diffused zener diodes,1 p-n diffused zener diodes, and n-p-n transistors are consistent with the gold electromigration theory. Several conditions are theoretically required for gold e!ectromigration of this type: the gold beam must be positive with respect to the silicon chip by more than some minimum voltage (the gold-gold electrolytic potential is 1.42 V); there must be a crack in the silicon nitride, or at the intersection of the beam and a chip, or a crack in the silicon above the beam; and an electrolyte such as moisture-containing halogen ions must be present in the crack. Vacuum baking of HMC's after cleaning and just before electrical testing, the elimination of water as a cleaning agent, and the elimination of trichloroethylene at final assembly cleaning have solved the leakage problem caused by gold electromigrafion in the devices.","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25234/01135206.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure Mechanisms in Beam Lead Semiconductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1977","displayDocTitle":"Failure Mechanisms in Beam Lead Semiconductors","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure Mechanisms in Beam Lead Semiconductors","sourcePdf":"01135206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016191S","chronDate":"Sep 1977","isNumber":"25234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1135206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135213,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Theoretically, the program will attain any desired accuracy less than 100 percent, but practical considerations of computer run times limit accuracies to the 90- to 95-percent region. The program has been tested by comparing computer results to known theoretical exact solutions and to actual measurements on sample hybrids. When compared to known theoretical exact solutions, the computer result accuracy is between 95 and 100 percent.

A series of experiments was carried out to determine the mechanism of gold-to-gold ultrasonic bonding. These experiments, including lift-off pattern studies, clamped-wire studies, and bond deformation versus ultrasonic vibration amplitude studies, indicate that gold ultrasonic bonding takes place primarily by means of a deformation mechanism as opposed to a heating or sliding mechanism. This is substantially the same result previously obtained from studies on the aluminum ultrasonic bonding mechanism. Further, it is shown that a deformation mechanism also holds for other forms of solid phase microelectronic bonding. Specific examples are taken from electric discharge \"tweezer welds\" and from thermocompression bonds.

Such transients repeat at intervals varying from fractions of a second to years, becoming more frequent during periods of temperature change. The tendency to produce this phenomenon can persist for the normal life of the capacitor? depending on thermal and electrical stresses encountered. The effect under study is not related to dielectric breakdown or corona discharge which are due to high electric stress. The observed transients can appear at the capacitor electrodes with either polarity during application of voltage as low as zero. The source of charge and energy for this phenomenon is dielectric absorption (DA) which is history dependant relating directly to the nature of the dielectric material. Materials with high DA such as Mylar are much more susceptible than \"nonpolar\" dielectrics such as polystyrene.

Initial extensive high-temperature characterization revealed that selected thickfilm passive components and silicon junction-field-effect transistors had electrical parameters sufficiently insensitive to temperature change and sufficiently constant in time at high temperatures to form the backbone of this circuitry. Attachment techniques needed to be developed, since standard methods failed at high temperatures. Similarly, circuit design innovations were needed because of the restricted list of parts.

In particular, it was shown that this resistor has an extremely low and controllable temperature coefficient of resistance. In the present paper a rigorous mathematical treatment of temperature coefficient changes in bulk metal film resistors due to thermal strains is presented. The resistance change corresponding to these thermal strains is used in resistor design to balance the inherent T.C. of the metal film.

Comparing this flashover voltage to the corona start voltage of similar size conventional terminals, this represents an improvement of more than four to one. The improvement has been gained by shielding the air near the critical mounting flange area with a metalized film on the interior of the ceramic body. The paper describes how this has reduced the system of dielectrics in this critical area to a single dielectric and has minimized the effect of the large difference in dielectric constant between alumina, transformer oil and air. This has been done without a significant increase in the stress carried by the internal insulation. Using this design concept, a 60 KV RMS corona free terminal for use on oil filled components has been designed, tested and is described. A small sulfur hexafluoride filled air-to-air feedthrough terminal, which is corona free to higher than 20 KV RMS and which uses the same principles, is also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1965","publicationDate":"June 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Corona Free High Voltage Feedthrough Terminal Design for Electronic Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Corona Free High Voltage Feedthrough Terminal Design for Electronic Applications","sourcePdf":"01135375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029882S","chronDate":"Jun 1965","isNumber":"25244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8221","articleId":"1135375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135379,"authors":[{"name":"B.

For films produced at 165-300 volts no failures were observed in ~ 400 samples for 2500 hours at 50 volts and 85\u00b0C. The behavior of leakage current, reverse and forward breakdown voltages, capacitance and dielectric loss as a function of anodization voltage was examined.

These are the initial results of a Navy program for the evaluation and design of solid-state electronics to be operated uncooled in aircraft-engine control applications. Based on these results and results from earlier investigations, discrete semiconductor devices of essentially all generic types function with usable characteristics at junction temperatures up to at least 300\u00b0C. First-order device parameter changes result from increased leakage, reduced mobility, and increased resistivity. Both analog and digital integrated circuits were found to exhibit dc as well as useful dynamic characteristics up to temperatures near 250\u00b0C. Bipolar circuits with either junction or dielectric isolation degrade due to changes in device operating points and high leakage currents. In analog circuits the temperature capabiity is found to depend critically on the specific circuit design implemented. For a variety of CMOS devices tested a pnpn latchup mechanism between the p-channel transistor and the input protection network limits useful device operation to 260\u00b0C. Changes in device and circuit layout are needed to circumvent this failure mode. No fundamental barrier to 300\u00b0C functionality of integrated circuits (designed specifically for high-temperature application) was found.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135474/","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Circuit Characteristics at 260\u00b0C for Aircraft Engine-Control Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Circuit Characteristics at 260\u00b0C for Aircraft Engine-Control Applications","sourcePdf":"01135474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027401S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"25250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1135474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1135487,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A graphical representation of the counting statistics for measuring alpha emission is developed in such a way as to be most convenient for use in the Quality Control Department of the manufacturer and user of the lids.","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1979.1135489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1979.1135489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25250/01135489.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alpha Emission Measurements of Lids and Solder Preforms on Semiconductor Packages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","displayDocTitle":"Alpha Emission Measurements of Lids and Solder Preforms on Semiconductor Packages","volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alpha Emission Measurements of Lids and Solder Preforms on Semiconductor Packages","sourcePdf":"01135489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023176S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"25250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1135489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1135491,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Commerical MOSFET's were found susceptible to parameter drifts and have unacceptable electrical characteristics when tested at 300\u00b0C, whereas redesigned low alkali impurity devices were able to maintain stable operation at 300\u00b0C for 1000 h with improved characteristics. Thus, although MOSFET's are prone to aging, it is possible to use fabrication procedures which allow MOSFET use at high temperature. A specially developed ceramic filled, high silica frit dielectric thick-film material exhibited a sufficiently high resistivity to permit development of 300\u00b0C, 1.0 \\muF capacitors. Procedures were developed to make this material compatible with the multilayer brick capacitor format which is necessary for miniaturization. Both this dielectric and a ruthenium-based resistor material were shown useful to 500\u00b0C.

Graphite alone is not sufficient to provide a suitable contact film for sliding conduction under space conditions. It is an electron conductor, and it is therefore possible that it can make weak metallic bonds with the metals in the absence of moisture or organic vapors.

This resistance is significantly lower than devices made from heretofore available barium titanate ceramics. PolySwitchTM overcurrent protectors are made from conductive polymer compositions, which are newly developed materials. Fabrication of a PolySwitch device includes the creation of the base conductive polymer composite, melt forming it to device shape, attachment of leads, and packaging. The final product looks like a disc capacitor but acts like a solid-state circuit breaker or resettable fuse. The source of the PTC effect in these compositions is volume expansion upon heating and the subsequent disruption of connecting carbon black chains. Resistance characteristics of these compositions are reproducible and consistent from device to device; the concepts of a minimum and maximum base resistance and a resistance recovery curve are discussed. Polymer volume compaction processes are responsible for the recovery behavior. The physics of PolySwitch device behavior is explained by Joule heating. The characteristics important to the designer are ultimate trip current as a function of ambient temperature, a property of thermal and electrical equilibrium; and the trip-time characteristic, a property of the nonequilibrium dynamic response. Knowledge of both these charactistics allows the designer to quickly choose a PolySwitch device for his particular job.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"December 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"PolySwitch PTC Devices-A New Low-Resistance Conductive Polymer-Based PTC Device for Overcurrent Protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PolySwitch PTC Devices-A New Low-Resistance Conductive Polymer-Based PTC Device for Overcurrent Protection","sourcePdf":"01135838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034559S","chronDate":"December  1981","isNumber":"25276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"74","articleId":"1135838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135879,"authors":[{"name":"S.

When the conductive elastomer is considered as an electrical contact material, it is possible to obtain conductive and elastic properties in one simple material. Therefore, the concept of metallic electrical contact can be changed to the elastomeric contact. Moreover due to excellent properties of facile shape formation, corrosion resistance, and air tight contact interface, the conductive elastomer is suitable for high density microsized connectors. However as it is very difficult to obtain as low a resistivity as in metals, the effectiveness of the elastomeric contacts is limited. The present study has been conducted to determine the electrical conduction mechanism and to find low resistivity materials. The specimen silicone rubber, in which electrical conductive particles such as carbon and metals were dispersed, was investigated. The resistivity versus conductive particle content, voltage versus current characteristics, resisitivity change in range of room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature, and conduction mechanisms were discussed. In conclusion the conduction mechanism changes with the conductive particle content. For large content current paths were established by contact of particles, and for small content conduction electrons pass through the gap between particles by the Schottky conduction. Therefore, the resistance of the elastomer consisted of particle resistance, constriction resistance of the contact interface between particles, and the gap resistance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1135954/","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Properties of Conductive Elastomer as Electrical Contact Material","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Properties of Conductive Elastomer as Electrical Contact Material","sourcePdf":"01135954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0701S","chronDate":"Mar 1982","isNumber":"25289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1135954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1135972,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The duration of the arc is found to be proportional to the inductance. In an associated experiment, metal migration from cathode to anode and from anode to cathode is measured using a radioactive tracer technique. It is found that the metal transfer is strongly dependent upon the inductance, and hence the duration of the arc, even at the lowest values of the inductance.

These capacitors frequently use thin~film dielectrics made of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate stretched films. On the other hand, examples of manufacturing techniques for making thin films of these materials for application in the field of microelectronics have been rare, and it appears that none has been developed to the stage of practical application. Polymers are essentially nonvolatile, and since they thermally decompose at a comparatively low temperature, existing thin-film techniques, 'which have been concerned mostly with inorganic materials, can not be readily applied. However, if appropriate thin-film fabrication techniques could be developed, the noncrystalline nature of these materials (and their basic long linear molecular structure that may be cross-linked) is considered extremely suitable for achieving excellent thin-film dielectric formations having few structural defects. A processing method has been developed for directly polymerizing and growing thin-film polymers on substrates by plasma reaction in a monomer atmosphere.

It is essential that the packages housing these chips, have good thermal and electrical characteristics to fully realize the potential of these chips. Extensive computer-based thermal modeling and experimental studies were performed to design a high thermal performance ceramic pin array package utilizing the cavity down approach. Single-layer alumina, muitilayer alumina, and muitilayer beryllia-alumina composite packages were studied. Both unidirectional and omnidirectional heatsinks were computer modeled, designed, and tested in a wind tunnel. Power transistor and MCA 2 logic chips were used to simulate the power levels.

However interconnection costs in all technologies are essentially invariant on a per unit length basis. The advancing scale of integration has allowed active devices to be smaller and closer together, so wiring, both on chip and in systems, has been cheaper because there has been less of it. It is shown that substrate interconnection capability (in inches of wire per square inch of substrate) is the critical factor in achieving compact low-cost systems characterized by high interconnection density. A relationship between the active silicon area of devices on a substrate and the interconnection capability of the substrate is presented.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25333/01136353.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnection Costs of Various Substrates-The Myth of Cheap Wire","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1984.1136353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1984.1136353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1136353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1984","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection Costs of Various Substrates-The Myth of Cheap Wire","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection Costs of Various Substrates-The Myth of Cheap Wire","sourcePdf":"01136353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014702S","chronDate":"Sep 1984","isNumber":"25333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1136353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1136368,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Strains applied during accelerated temperature cycling have been shown to cause cracks in the solder and electrical failures (opens). The forces and moments exerted on the solder (and the resulting displacements) arc inferred from strain gage measurements of the in-plane deformation and bending of the PWB and the CCC. It is found that below room temperature, most of the expansion mismatch is accommodated by \"bi-metallic strip\" type bending of the PWB and the CCC. The change in bending during a temperature change from - 25\u00b0C to +35\u00b0C is consistent with the classical bi-metallic strip equation, given material properties from the literature. Above room temperature most of the mismatch is accommodated by shear in the solder. Upon repeated temperature cycling, there is a repeatable stress-strain hysteresis, which is attributed to plastic deformation in the solder. This deformation is lower for staggered tin pillar joints than for in-line 60/40 solder post joints. It is lower still when the PWB in-plane expansivity is constrained by copperclad invar (CCI) layers included in the stack-up. Using mechanical equilibrium conditions, we can calculate the force per joint and solder shear displacement. The force represents up to 35 percent of the ultimate force calculated from the ultimate shear strength.","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1984.1136384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25334/01136384.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1984.1136384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","startPage":"314","endPage":"327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forces, Moments, and Displacements During Thermal Chamber Cycling of Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers Soldered to Printed Boards","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1136384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1984","displayDocTitle":"Forces, Moments, and Displacements During Thermal Chamber Cycling of Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers Soldered to Printed Boards","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136384/","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forces, Moments, and Displacements During Thermal Chamber Cycling of Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers Soldered to Printed Boards","sourcePdf":"01136384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098746S","chronDate":"Dec 1984","isNumber":"25334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"80","articleId":"1136384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1136416,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Wear can be classified roughly into four types: adhesive wear, abrasive wear, chemical wear, and galling wear. Consideration of the effect of load on real contact area leads to the principle that wear is proportional to the load and inversely proportional to the hardness of the softer of the sliding pair. Abrasive wear decreases to negligible amounts when the abraded surface approaches the hardness level of the abrasive. The mechanism of wear of ceramics is different from metals. It occurs by microfragmentation. Friction of dry surfaces is a function of shear strength of contact junctions and hardness. Friction is independent of apparent area of contact but is extremely sensitive to surface chemistry.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25339/01136416.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1971.1136416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1971.1136416","startPage":"99","endPage":"105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Friction and Wear","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136416/","displayDocTitle":"Friction and Wear","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Friction and Wear","sourcePdf":"01136416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041848S","chronDate":"Jun 1971","isNumber":"25339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1136416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1136418,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The experiments have been planned in order to differentiate between the effects of cold welding, diffusion welding and percussion welding. Cold welding has no affect on newly prepared electrodes, but after the electrodes have been arced appreciably a small residual cold weld force is experienced. The diffusion weld strength is strongly dependent upon the contact force, the electrode temperature and the time in contact. The strongest weld forces are measured in the percussion weld experiment where the electrodes experience a high current prestrike arc as they close. It is also found in this study that the weld force decreases rapidly after the electrode faces are exposed to the residual gases in the vacuum. These results are discussed in terms of the chemisorption of residual gases and the real area of electrical contact. The effects of the change in nature of the electrode surfaces are discussed and a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the results is reached.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136435/","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation Into the Factors Contributing to Welding of Contact Electrodes in High Vaccum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation Into the Factors Contributing to Welding of Contact Electrodes in High Vaccum","sourcePdf":"01136435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037896S","chronDate":"Mar 1971","isNumber":"25342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8221","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1136435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1136442,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Data clearly indicate that the \"desirable\" properties of silver sulfide are unique only to films on pure silver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1971","publicationDate":"March 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Substrate on the Contact Resistance of Tarnish Films","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Substrate on the Contact Resistance of Tarnish Films","sourcePdf":"01136442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048355S","chronDate":"Mar 1971","isNumber":"25342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8221","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1136442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1136482,"authors":[{"name":"N.

These anomalies have been deliberately provoked in a further special study, reported here, of the influence of encapsulation and the effectiveness of overglazing in safeguarding the long-term stability of thick-film resistors. In this paper ruthenium-based thick-film resistors ranging in value from ohms to megohms were finished in a variety of different ways, such as with and without overglaze, with and without laser trim, and with and without plastic encapsulation, and subjected to damp heat and thermal overstress with and without electrical bias. The plastic encapsulaut employed was a particularly active one selected for its properties of nonneutral pH and high ionic content, which are usually regarded as undesirable for electronic component encapsulation but are useful in this instance to exaggerate the effects to be studied.","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1985.1136482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25347/01136482.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1985.1136482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25347","startPage":"207","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Plastic Encapsulation, Overglaze, and Voltage on Anomalous Behavior of Thick-Film Resistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1136482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Plastic Encapsulation, Overglaze, and Voltage on Anomalous Behavior of Thick-Film Resistors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Plastic Encapsulation, Overglaze, and Voltage on Anomalous Behavior of Thick-Film Resistors","sourcePdf":"01136482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050763S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"25347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1136482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1136535,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A computer simulation based on the finite element method and Monte Carlo method is applied to the problem of contact, and the conductance of a global model for contact is studied. The model consists of two unit cubes and a random interface between the cubes. More specifically, the two identical uniform conducting cubes are in contact across a pair of adjacent faces through a layer of thickness 2d subdivided into N x N small subsquares of which a randomly selected area fraction f has the same conductivity as the cubes (a clean-contact state), while the remaining area.fraction (1 - f) represents zero conductivity. The conductance of this global model for contact is computed and compared with previously published results. Particularly, when N, d, and f are changed, the behavior of the global conductance is investigated and discussed. It is clearly shown that because of extreme current concentration through the contact area the conductance does not decrease until f becomes close to zero.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer Simulation for the Conductance of a Contact Interface","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1986.1136639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25361/01136639.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1986.1136639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1136639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1986","displayDocTitle":"Computer Simulation for the Conductance of a Contact Interface","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer Simulation for the Conductance of a Contact Interface","sourcePdf":"01136639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038246S","chronDate":"Jun 1986","isNumber":"25361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1136639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1136645,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This sensor has long wiring patterns between a photodiode array and scanning circuits, giving rise to large parasitic capacitances. Because of these parasitic capacitances, the sensitivity and the modulation transfer function (MTF) are lowered and are forced to have spatial nonuniformity. In this sensor a fixed pattern noise (FPN) is the most serious obstruction to the attainment of a high signal-to-noise ratio. The major causes of the FPN are found to be the error voltage induced by the turning-off of a reset switch, and the offset voltage of a unity-gain amplifier. For further improvements the reduction of the parasitic capacitances and the elimination of their distribution will be required. Appropriate choice of the thickness of a-Si film will also contribute to improving the image quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel6/33/25362/01136654.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCHMT.1986.1136654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCHMT.1986.1136654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1136654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of a Large-Scale Linear Image Sensor Using Amorphous Silicon","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Large-scale systems","Image sensors","Amorphous silicon","Sensor arrays","Parasitic capacitance","Signal to noise ratio","Voltage","Switches","Photoconductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amorphous semiconductor materials/devices","Image sensors","Photodiodes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of a Large-Scale Linear Image Sensor Using Amorphous Silicon","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of a Large-Scale Linear Image Sensor Using Amorphous Silicon","sourcePdf":"01136654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066128S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"25362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1136654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1136669,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The capacitor remained stable with no failures occurring when aged under various conditions of voltage, temperature, and humidity. The capacitor can be processed in a manner compatible with the manufacturing process of the TM or TMM capacitor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel6/8217/25367/01136730.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPHP.1973.1136730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPHP.1973.1136730","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SiO<inf>2</inf>-Ta<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>Thin Film Capacitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1136730/","displayDocTitle":"An SiO<inf>2</inf>-Ta<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>Thin Film Capacitor","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SiO<inf>2</inf>-Ta<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>Thin Film Capacitor","sourcePdf":"01136730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022263S","chronDate":"Sep 1973","isNumber":"25367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8217","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1136730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1136735,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper presents RAP, a new real-time communication architecture for large-scale sensor networks. RAP provides convenient, high-level query and event services for distributed micro-sensing applications. Novel location-addressed communication models are supported by a scalable and light-weight network stack. We present and evaluate a new packet scheduling policy called velocity monotonic scheduling that inherently accounts for both time and distance constraints. We show that this policy is particularly suitable for communication scheduling in sensor networks in which a large number of wireless devices are seamlessly integrated into a physical space to perform real-time monitoring and control. Detailed simulations of representative sensor network environments demonstrate that RAP significantly reduces the end-to-end deadline miss ratio in the sensor network.","doi":"10.1109/RTTAS.2002.1137381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25378","startPage":"55","endPage":"66","pdfPath":"/iel5/8227/25378/01137381.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This framework dynamically adjusts the CPU voltage/frequency so that no task in the system misses its deadline and the total energy savings of the system are maximized. In this paper we consider only realistic, discrete-level speeds. Each task in the system consumes a certain amount of energy, which depends on a speed chosen for execution. The process of selecting speeds for execution while maximizing the energy savings of the system requires the exploration of a large number of combinations, which is too time consuming to be computed online. Thus, we propose an integrated heuristic methodology which executes an optimization procedure in a. low computation time. This scheme allows the scheduler to handle power-aware real-time tasks with low cost while maximizing the use of the available resources and without jeopardizing the temporal constraints of the system. Simulation results show that our heuristic methodology is able to generate power-aware scheduling solutions with near-optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/RTTAS.2002.1137399","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The acoustic-communication link is used to track and send commands to the lander and to transmit experiment data and lander status to a surface ship.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1985.1137410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel6/48/25386/01137410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1985.1137410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication, control, and data acquisition systems on the ISHTE lander","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Control systems","Data acquisition","Sea surface","Ocean temperature","Marine vehicles","Heat transfer","Sea floor","Acoustic testing","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Radioactive pollution","Sea floor","Underwater acoustic communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"January  1985","displayDocTitle":"Communication, control, and data acquisition systems on the ISHTE lander","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137410/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication, control, and data acquisition systems on the ISHTE lander","sourcePdf":"01137410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032534S","chronDate":"January  1985","isNumber":"25386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1137410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1137528,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The estimator we propose is a signal subspace scaled MUSIC algorithm, which we call SSMUSIC. It is not a subspace weighted MUSIC, because the scaling depends on the eigenstructure of the estimated signal subspace. SSMUSIC has the advantage of simultaneously estimating the DOA and the power of each source. We employ a second-order perturbation analysis of the estimator and derive stochastic representations for its bias and squared-error. We compare the new DOA estimator with the MUSIC estimator, based on these representations.

The raindrop size distribution (DSD) is one of the major sources of error in any prediction model, mainly because of its variability in both space and time. The DSD parameters are computed from distrometer data that are classified into stratiform and convective types using S-band radar data. The method of moments is employed to estimate the parameters of lognormal DSD. The modeled DSD parameters are optimized by examining the root mean square (RMS) error and the average probability ratio (APR) in estimation of the rain rate, rain attenuation, and radar reflectivity factor simultaneously. The proposed model gives maximum (close to unity) APR and minimum RMS error when compared to any other set of DSD parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2002.802091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/25387/01137538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2002.802091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25387","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Raindrop size distribution using method of moments for terrestrial and satellite communication applications in Singapore","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1137538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Raindrop size distribution using method of moments for terrestrial and satellite communication applications in Singapore","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486278","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1137538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Raindrop size distribution using method of moments for terrestrial and satellite communication applications in Singapore","sourcePdf":"01137538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082007S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"25387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"25387","articleId":"1137538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1137540,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A double resonator equivalent circuit model is presented and used to estimate the impedance bandwidth and the respective distributions of radiation losses with typical parameter values at 900 and 1800 MHz. It is noticed that at 900 MHz, the radiation losses of the antenna element wavemode represent typically less than 10% of the total power. Thus, the antenna element works mainly as a matching element, which couples to the low-Q resonant wavemode of the chassis. At 1800 MHz, the contribution of the antenna element wavemode is larger. By enhancing the coupling and by tuning the chassis resonance, it is possible to obtain an impedance bandwidth of over 50% (6 dB return loss) at both at 900 and 1800 MHz. The results given by the equivalent circuit study are fully supported by those of three-dimensional phone-model simulations, including calculation of the SAR and efficiency values. In prototyping, the 6 dB bandwidth of 5.5% was obtained at 980 MHz with a nonradiating coupling element with a volume of 1.6 cm/sup 3/ on a 120 mm long chassis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonator-based analysis of the combination of mobile handset antenna and chassis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2002.802085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/25387/01137540.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2002.802085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1137540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Resonator-based analysis of the combination of mobile handset antenna and chassis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1137540/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7486279","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonator-based analysis of the combination of mobile handset antenna and chassis","sourcePdf":"01137540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058685S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"25387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"371","xplore-issue":"25387","articleId":"1137540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1137545,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, USA"],"lastName":"Zhong Ji","id":"37087288814"},{"name":"T.K.

The genetic algorithm stores system states, in which there is generation deficiency to supply system maximum load, in a state array. The given load pattern is then convoluted with the state array to obtain adequacy indices. A state array is also used to obtain useful information about the contribution of different states and generation unit combinations to the probability of system failure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7497870","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1137583/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adequacy assessment of power system generation using a modified simple genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adequacy assessment of power system generation using a modified simple genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01137583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06879S","chronDate":"Nov.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"25389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"25389","articleId":"1137583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1137584,"authors":[{"name":"Mingbo Liu","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Design, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Mingbo Liu was born in Hunan Province, China, on December 23, 1964.

This algorithm realizes successive discretization of the discrete control variables in the optimization process by incorporating a penalty function into the nonlinear primal-dual interior-point algorithm. The principle of handling these discrete variables by the penalty function, the timing of introducing the penalty function during iterations, and the setting of penalty factors are discussed in detail. To solve the high-dimension linear correction equation speedily and efficiently in each iteration, a novel data structure rearrangement is proposed. Compared with the existing data structures, it can effectively reduce the number of nonzero fill-in elements and does not give rise to difficulty in triangular factorization. The numerical results of test systems that range in size from 14 to 538 buses have shown that the proposed method can give nearly optimum solutions, has good convergence, and is suitable for large-scale system applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7497871","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1137584/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An extended nonlinear primal-dual interior-point algorithm for reactive-power optimization of large-scale power systems with discrete control variables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extended nonlinear primal-dual interior-point algorithm for reactive-power optimization of large-scale power systems with discrete control variables","sourcePdf":"01137584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12359S","chronDate":"Nov.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"25389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"25389","articleId":"1137584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1137587,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

This paper contributes with a new allocation method among the electric market participants. Both cooperation and competition are defined as the leading principles to fair solutions and efficient cost allocation. The method is based mainly on the responsibility of the agents in the physical and economic use of the network, their rational behavior, the formation of coalitions, and cooperative game theory resolution mechanisms. The designed method is applicable to existing networks or to their expansion. Simulations are made with sample networks. Results conclude that adequate solutions are possible in a decentralized environment with open access to networks. Comparisons with traditional allocation systems are shown and cooperative game solutions compare better in economic and physical terms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1137587/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","accessionNumber":"7497874","volume":"17","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission cost allocation by cooperative games and coalition formation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission cost allocation by cooperative games and coalition formation","sourcePdf":"01137587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073235S","chronDate":"Nov.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"25389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"25389","articleId":"1137587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1137591,"authors":[{"name":"S. de la Torre","affiliation":["Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales, Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Sebasti\u00e1n de la Torre (S'00) was born in M\u00e1laga, Spain.

The approach simplifies the mathematical model of the daily setting values of reactive power/voltage control devices, solves the temporal optimization of each control device by heuristic rules, and then converts the optimization model with time-varying load into the same one as conventional optimization model with constant load. Therefore, the algorithms applied to the conventional optimization model can be easily used to solve the optimization model with time-varying load demand.

At the outset, this concept is applied to a simple device such as thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) connected in a single-machine infinite bus power system and is then extended to interline power-flow controller (IPFC) connected in a multimachine power system. The RBFNN uses single neuron architecture and its parameters are dynamically updated in an online fashion with TS-fuzzy scheme designed with only four rules and triangular membership function. The rules of the TS-fuzzy scheme are derived from the real- or reactive-power error and their derivatives either at the TCSC or IPFC buses depending on the device. Further, to implement this combined scheme only one coefficient in the TS-fuzzy rules needs to be optimized. The optimization of this coefficient as well as the coefficient for auxiliary signal generation is performed through genetic algorithm. The performance of the new controller is evaluated in single-machine and multimachine power systems subjected to various transient disturbances. The new genetic-neuro-fuzzy control scheme exhibits a superior damping performance as well as a greater critical clearing time in comparison to the existing PI and RBFNN controller with updating of its parameters through the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Its simple architecture reduces the computational burden, thereby making it attractive for real-time implementation.

This optimization problem is large-scale, combinatorial, mixed-integer, and nonlinear. Exact solution techniques to solve it are not currently available. This paper proposes a novel repair genetic algorithm conducted through heuristics to achieve a near optimal solution to this problem. This optimization technique is directly parallelizable. Three different parallel approaches have been developed. The modeling framework provided by genetic algorithms is less restrictive than the frameworks provided by other approaches such as dynamic programming or Lagrangian relaxation. A state-of-the-art Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is used to appraise the behavior of the proposed parallel genetic algorithm. The computing time requirement to solve problems of realistic size is moderate. The developed genetic algorithm has been successfully applied to realistic case studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497902","htmlLink":"/document/1137615/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A parallel repair genetic algorithm to solve the unit commitment problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel repair genetic algorithm to solve the unit commitment problem","sourcePdf":"01137615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159902S","chronDate":"Nov.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"25389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"25389","articleId":"1137615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1137622,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Nevertheless, future systems will have strong requirements on reusability and communication performance, which will constrain the use of such interconnect systems. An emerging approach, the networks-on-chip (NOCs), will potentially fulfill those requirements, because NOCs are reusable and their communication performance gracefully scales with the system growth. However, it is still not clear when the use of NOCs will become mandatory. This work introduces some studies to define the switching point when NOCs become the preferred communication architecture. A bus and a NOC are modeled and compared by using a set of mathematical models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on communication issues for systems-on-chip","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2002.1137647","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/8229/25383/01137647.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2002.1137647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1137647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"A study on communication issues for systems-on-chip","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1137647/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7516551","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on communication issues for systems-on-chip","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01137647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059923S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8229","isNumber":"25383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8229","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"25383","articleId":"1137647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1137650,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This presentation focuses on SRAM-based FPGAs. Their simplicity and flexibility for user changes in the field make this type of FPGA a very popular choice among designers. The architecture and design of these devices have been widely investigated during the last decade, but their test challenges have received less attention. Only recently researchers have addressed the problem of testing FPGAs after manufacturing, in other words, before user programming of specific functions. Testing before programming presents a wide spectrum of problems, for which a number of researchers have proposed innovative solutions. Testing an FPGA chip poses a challenging problem for test engineers. It requires implementing various configurations (programmings) of the FPGA. But changing configurations incurs reprogramming costs. So the fundamental question for FPGA testing is how can we determine the minimum number of test configurations and corresponding vector test sequences that will cover all the faults of a given FPGA's fault model? Solutions are presented in the presentation for various architectural elements of SRAM-based FPGAs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A structural test methodology for SRAM-based FPGAs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2002.1137687","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/8229/25383/01137687.pdf","startPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2002.1137687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1137687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1137687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-14 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A structural test methodology for SRAM-based FPGAs","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7516591","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A structural test methodology for SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01137687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042217S","chronDate":"14-14 Sept. 2002","isNumber":"25383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1137687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1137735,"authors":[{"name":"V.

When a contiguous node allocation strategy is used, there is a trade-off between improved run-time of jobs (due to reduced link contention and lower communication overhead) and increased wait-time of jobs (due to external fragmentation of the processor system). Using trace-based simulation, a buddy strategy for contiguous node allocation is shown to be unattractive compared to the standard noncontiguous allocation strategy used in all production job schedulers. A simple but effective scheme for selective buddy allocation is then proposed, that is shown to perform better than non-contiguous allocation.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2002.1137735","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This paper describes resource-allocation strategies to achieve processor locality for parallel jobs in Cplant and other supercomputers. Users of Cplant and other Sandia supercomputers submit parallel jobs to a job queue. When a job is scheduled to run, it is assigned to a set of processors. To obtain maximum throughput, jobs should be allocated to localized clusters of processors to minimize communication costs and to avoid bandwidth contention caused by overlapping jobs. This paper introduces new allocation strategies and performance metrics based on space-filling curves and one dimensional allocation strategies. These algorithms are general and simple. Preliminary simulations and Cplant experiments indicate that both space-filling curves and one-dimensional packing improve processor locality compared to the sorted free list strategy previously used on Cplant. These new allocation strategies are implemented in the new release of the Cplant System Software, Version 2.0, phased into the Cplant systems at Sandia by May 2002.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2002.1137758","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

To enhance performance of noncontiguous I/O, we have created list I/O, a native version of noncontiguous I/O. We have used the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) to implement our ideas.

Greatly enhanced fields are observed on most of the flights, and these are correlated with a new meteorological parameter related to mean index gradient and atmospheric stability. It is also shown that minimum propagation conditions are some 20 db improved over other ground-to-ground or ground-to-air experiments. This improvement is attributed to greater antenna height at the ground terminal which lowers the lowest lobe of the vertical radiation pattern of the ground terminal. It is also pointed out that there is a high probability that minimum propagation conditions will not exist simultaneously for the plane-to-California and plane-to-Hawaii paths. Enhanced propagation conditions will therefore exist from the plane to one of the terminals for an operationally significant fraction of the time. It is pointed out that many existing VHF air-to-ground systems throughout the world can be extended to at least 500 miles through increased effective power and high antenna sites.

This paper presents a new approach to the unequally-spaced array problem. It is based on the use of Poisson's sum formula and the introduction of a new function, the \"source position function.\" By appropriate transformation, the original radiation pattern is converted into a series of integrals, each of which is equivalent to the radiation from a continuous source distribution whose amplitude and phase distribution clearly exhibit the effects of the unequal spacings. By this method, it is possible to design unequally-spaced arrays which produce a desired radiation pattern. This method is effective in treating arrays of a large number of elements, and unequally-spaced arrays on a curved surface. Three examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The problem of sidelobe reduction for the array of uniform amplitude, which was attacked by Harrington, is treated by our method. A numerical example is shown for 25-db sidelobe level. Also, the problem of secondary beam suppression is attacked with the use of the Anger function.

Two examples are considered: 1) an initial static pattern with 30-db sidelobes which are reduced to about 40 db by sequential switching and 2) an initial static pattern with 13-db sidelobes which are reduced directly to about 40 db by a different sequence of switching.

The self-focusing feature of these receiving antenna systems is achieved by a set of phase-locked loops, which permit phase adjustments of signals received by various antenna elements continuously regardless of the direction of the transmitting source. For a transmitting antenna, the self-focusing feature is provided by a pilot signal from the receiving station which enables the transmitting antenna beam to point in the direction of the receiving station automatically.

It is found that for almost all cases of practical interest the required number of elements is closely related to the desired sidelobe level and is almost independent of the aperture dimension, the resolution (or the beamwidth) depends mainly on the aperture dimension, and the directive gain is proportional to the number of elements used if the average spacing is large. As a consequence the number of elements required is considerably less than that with uniform spacings. Starting with a given number of elements and a given aperture size, it is possible to improve the resolution by a factor of ten, a hundred, or more by spreading these elements over a larger aperture with little risk in obtaining a much higher sidelobe level and a lower directive gain. In fact, this method offers a solution which is optimum in a certain statistical sense, i.e., all sidelobes are of equal level with equal probability. In addition, this analysis also gives a simple estimate of the sidelobe level of most nonuniformly spaced antenna arrays. In a number of such arrays studied by various investigators with high speed computers, the agreement found is remarkable.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1964.1138220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25414/01138220.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1964.1138220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical theory of antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138220/","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical theory of antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical theory of antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements","sourcePdf":"01138220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030618S","chronDate":"May 1964","isNumber":"25414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"243","articleId":"1138220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1138229,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The ideal radiation pattern of one such element in a large planar array has a cosine variation of gain with angle when the elements are closely spaced, and has a peak value of gain equal to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4\\pi A/\\lambda^{2}</tex>\nwhere\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</tex>\nis the area allotted to each element. The active impedance of each element in a practical phased array varies with scan angle, because of mutual coupling between the elements. The associated mismatch causes power to be returned to the generators, thereby reducing the gain realized by the array and by the element. The element pattern, measured in the proper environment of surrounding elements, deviates from the ideal pattern in proportion to this effect. Mutual coupling is inherently unavoidable in a closely-spaced infinite array of elements; for example, in a square array with less than\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda/\\sqrt{2}</tex>\nspacing. There is a loss of element efficiency caused by the coupling, and since coupling increases with closer spacing, this accounts for the lower gain expected from ideal elements with reduced allotted area. Grating lobes can exist when the elements are not closely spaced; for example, in a square array with more than\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\lambda/2</tex>\nspacing. In this case, the ideal pattern is truncated to discriminate against grating lobes; this gives the higher gain expected from ideal elements with larger allotted area. It is concluded that in a phased-array antenna having a very large number of regularly-spaced radiating elements, perfect impedance match for all scan angles can be postulated for every typical element without encountering any real discrepancy in the determination of element gain. In the absence of grating lobes, such an antenna would realize the greatest possible gain for all scan angles.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1964.1138237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25415/01138237.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1964.1138237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The element-gain paradox for a phased-array antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138237/","displayDocTitle":"The element-gain paradox for a phased-array antenna","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The element-gain paradox for a phased-array antenna","sourcePdf":"01138237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060706S","chronDate":"July  1964","isNumber":"25415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"135","articleId":"1138237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1138239,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Because of this change, it is ordinarily possible to match the active impedance at only one angle. However, by the addition of lossless circuits which interconnect the element lines, good impedance match over a wide range of scan angles may be obtained. The effects of connecting circuits are easily analyzed in terms of simple equivalent circuits when the array is infinite. For this reason, and because no change is required in the radiating element, the connecting-circuit method is well suited for application to phased arrays containing a large number of regularly-spaced elements. As an example of the use of connecting circuits for wide-angle matching of an array, calculations are made for an infinite planar array of dipoles.

By simple measurements of a few elements inside of waveguides, their performance in the antenna array as a function of frequency, scan angle, and polarization may be determined. The number of elements that need to be constructed is small, and the method is well-suited to economical, empirical design of an element for an array having a very large number of elements. For this purpose, such an array is well represented by the infinite array which results from imaging by the waveguide walls. Five waveguide simulators, sampling five significant combinations of scan angle and polarization, have been developed for a particular array comprising circular elements in a square arrangement. The array impedance has been measured in the simulators, and from these measurements the reflection loss of the array has been calculated. An equivalent circuit for the element in the array has been obtained from two simple waveguide-impedance measurements, and the active impedance of the elements has been determined therefrom. Finally, these results have been employed to determine the behavior of the elements when the array is excited for circular polarization; the departure from circularity of the radiated polarization, as well as the reflection in both senses of circular polarization, have been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1965.1138428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25425/01138428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1965.1138428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25425","startPage":"342","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of a phased-array antenna in waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of a phased-array antenna in waveguide","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1965","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of a phased-array antenna in waveguide","sourcePdf":"01138428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035698S","chronDate":"May 1965","isNumber":"25425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"158","articleId":"1138428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1138429,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The electric current sheet, or resistance sheet, is the limiting case of many small electric dipoles, closely spaced, and backed by an open-circuit boundary. If this array is viewed as a receiver, a plane wave incident on the array at some angle (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\theta</tex>\n) meets a boundary resistance varying in proportion to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\cos \\theta</tex>\nfor angles in the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</tex>\nplane, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/\\cos \\theta</tex>\nfor angles in the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</tex>\nplane. If the array is matched at broadside (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\theta=0</tex>\n), the corresponding reflection coefficient has the magnitude\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(\\tan \\frac{1}{2}\\theta)^{2}</tex>\n. While the electric current sheet is realizable, the open-circuit boundary is not. However, a magnetic current sheet can be simulated by a conductive sheet with holes utilized as magnetic dipoles, such a sheet providing the backing equivalent to a short-circuit boundary. The latter case is related to the former by electromagnetic inversion or duality. Therefore, an incident plane wave meets a boundary conductance varying in proportion to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\cos \\theta</tex>\nfor angles in the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</tex>\nplane, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/\\cos \\theta</tex>\nfor angles in the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</tex>\nplane. The predicted behavior is verified qualitatively by tests of such a model with elements of a practice size. The derivation is based on the principle of dividing the space in front of the array into parallel tubes or waveguides, one for each element cell in the sheet or array. This is one of the principles published by the author in 1948. A related principle enables the simulation of an infinite array by imaging a few elements in the walls of a waveguide. This latter principle is utilized for making tests of the array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple relations derived fom a phased-array antenna made of an infinite current sheet","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1965.1138456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25426/01138456.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1965.1138456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1965","displayDocTitle":"Simple relations derived fom a phased-array antenna made of an infinite current sheet","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple relations derived fom a phased-array antenna made of an infinite current sheet","sourcePdf":"01138456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039855S","chronDate":"July  1965","isNumber":"25426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"186","articleId":"1138456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1138471,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For the purpose of computation of the array factor the elements of the array are assumed to be isotropic radiators. The elements of each circle have equal current amplitudes and are phased so that the contributions of all the elements add in phase in the direction of the main beam. The Chebyshev radiation pattern function is approximated by a truncated Fourier-Bessel series, from which the current amplitude of each circle is obtained. From these current amplitudes a method for computing the current amplitude to excite a new distribution of fewer circles is shown.

Although the majority of these few arrays are characterized by space-tapering, an overwhelming number of space-tapered arrays do not have low sidelobe level. Some statistical studies are made in order to relate the sidelobe level to the element arrangement. Finally, in the light of rather complete information of these arrays, a comparative study is made on some designs which are proposed by a few authors.

The harmonic incident wave is assumed to have its electric vector perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and the fields are assumed to have no variations along this axis. Although some investigators have approximated the field within the dielectric body by the incident field, a more accurate solution is obtained here by treating the field as an unknown function which is determined by solving a system of linear equations. Scattering patterns obtained by this method are presented for dielectric shells of circular and semicircular cross section, and for a thin plane dielectric slab of finite width. The results for the circular shell agree accurately with the exact classical solution. The effects of surface-wave excitation and mutual interaction among the various portions of the shell are included automatically in this solution.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1966.1138730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25436/01138730.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1966.1138730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TE-wave scattering by a dielectric cylinder of arbitrary cross-section shape","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138730/","displayDocTitle":"TE-wave scattering by a dielectric cylinder of arbitrary cross-section shape","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TE-wave scattering by a dielectric cylinder of arbitrary cross-section shape","sourcePdf":"01138730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026328S","chronDate":"Jul 1966","isNumber":"25436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"190","articleId":"1138730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1138733,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Two sample arrays, each consisting of 210 elements over a circular aperture of about 56 wavelengths in diameter, were tested at 71.25 GHz. The measured sidelobe levels were -12.8 dB and -13 dB, in excellent agreement with the theory which predicted below -12.8 dB with 90 percent probability and -13.3 dB with 50 percent probability. Further, one may consider the pattern in each plane cutting through the antenna as that of a linear random array. Thus one may study the sample distribution of the sidelobe levels of as many linear random arrays as cuts. The results showed a nearly perfect agreement with the theory, despite the fact that in the theory the mutual coupling effect was neglected altogether. This experiment seems to suggest that when the average element spacing is of the order of a few wavelengths or more, the net coupling effect on the pattern of a random array is generally negligible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"An experiment on antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experiment on antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements","sourcePdf":"01138876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027604S","chronDate":"March  1967","isNumber":"25444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1138876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1138880,"authors":[{"name":"D.

They may be advantageously utilized in the study and optimization of a technique for determining the polarization of an antenna by amplitude measurements only. In this technique, the response of the antenna to four waves of known-but-different polarization states is measured. From the measurements, three ratios are formed which are the relative polarization efficiencies of the antenna to the waves. Each ratio is representable as a contour on the polarization chart; the intersection of the three contours determines the antenna polarization. Defects or imperfections in the measurement system are representable as translations or distortions of the contours, yielding a simple relation between defects and resulting errors in determination of the antenna polarization. The contours may be used to minimize errors by, for example, choosing the four wave polarization states so that two of the three contours are nearly orthogonal for all expected values of the antenna polarization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1967","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The polarization sphere as a graphical aid in determining the polarization of an antenna by amplitude measurements only","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The polarization sphere as a graphical aid in determining the polarization of an antenna by amplitude measurements only","sourcePdf":"01138904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037661S","chronDate":"Mar 1967","isNumber":"25444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1138904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1138908,"authors":[{"name":"W.

These relationships can lead to gross conceptual errors regarding the basic capabilities of amplitude monopulse antennas. This paper develops similar relationships which include the effects of mutual coupling. It is found that the sum and difference beams are still proportional to the sum and to the difference of the squinted beams but the constants of proportionality, which are related to the VSWR's at the sum and difference ports before matching, are generally different. These constants of proportionality, or VSWR's, can be evaluated in terms of the squinted beams in the case of lossless antennas by applying the principle of conservation of energy. The matched sum pattern gain on boresight and the matched difference pattern slope on boresight are computed for a lossless antenna with squinted beams of the form\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\sin k\\theta/k\\theta</tex>\nversus squint angle. The results obtained are drastically different from previously published results. Both of these antenna parameters are maximum in the limit of zero squint angle. However, for these squinted beam shapes, a small squint angle implies that a very high VSWR is to be matched at the difference port. It is noted that a given pair of matched sum and difference patterns can be produced by different pairs of squinted beams. These pairs of squinted beams can differ in their amplitudes and shapes. However, a single pair of squinted beams corresponds to inherently matched sum and difference ports.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1967.1138967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25446/01138967.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"526","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1967.1138967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relationships between squinted, sum and difference radiation patterns of amplitude monopulse antennas with mutual coupling between feeds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","displayDocTitle":"Relationships between squinted, sum and difference radiation patterns of amplitude monopulse antennas with mutual coupling between feeds","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relationships between squinted, sum and difference radiation patterns of amplitude monopulse antennas with mutual coupling between feeds","sourcePdf":"01138967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029332S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"25446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1138967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1138981,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This efficiency is a measure of the strength of mutual coupling effects and also of the average reflection coefficient magnitude at a typical element in the active array as the elements are phased over a prescribed range. An upper bound to this efficiency, which is only a function of the array geometry, exists and corresponds to an array of antennas with certain ideal characteristics. A technique for evaluating this ideal or maximum efficiency of an element in an arbitrary infinite lattice is presented. While this efficiency is readily evaluated for some special configurations, the computation for any general space lattice becomes straightforward in terms of the formalism. The formalism is based on the \"reciprocal lattice\" and a transformed (Cartesian) version of the space and reciprocal lattices. The required integral is numerically equal to the area common to a unit square and an ellipse in this transformed lattice. Results are given for various rhombic and parallelogram lattices which include the square and the equilateral triangle as special cases. It is noted that for parallelograms of aspect ratio greater than about 4 to 1, the efficiency is nearly the same as for the limiting linear array.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Phased arrays","Antenna arrays","Optical reflection","Planar arrays","Antenna measurements","Gain measurement","Mutual coupling","Upper bound","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Planar arrays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.1967.1138981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25446/01138981.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1967.1138981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ideal efficiency of a radiating element in an infinite array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1138981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ideal efficiency of a radiating element in an infinite array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1138981/","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ideal efficiency of a radiating element in an infinite array","sourcePdf":"01138981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039863S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"25446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1138981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1138993,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A dissipative slab in the presence of a reflecting ionosphere is employed to describe the forest configuration. If the effect of the ground-forest interface is disregarded, the radiated field of an arbitrarily oriented, small dipole is found to consist primarily of two separate waves: a lateral wave which skims along the tree tops, and a sky wave which is produced by a single-hop reflection at the ionospheric layer. These two field constituents are compared and their domains of preponderance are calculated for a large range of the pertinent parameters; it is then found that the lateral wave plays the major role since the sky wave is restricted to a narrow frequency band and its amplitude is appreciable only at large distances. The lateral-wave field is examined in detail and is shown to yield a simple physical picture for the propagation mechanism in forests. Its features are found to be qualitatively consistent with the field behavior reported in the literature and the quantitative aspects agree well with the available experimental data. The observed variation of the field with distance, the height-gain effect, the vegetation factor, the basic path loss, and depolarization effects are separately examined and are all shown to express merely one or another of the intrinsic properties of a lateral wave. The ground-proximity effect produced by the presence of a planar-conducting ground is also estimated and shown to be of minor importance in most cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1967.1139054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25448","startPage":"806","endPage":"817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25448/01139054.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On radio-wave propagation in forest environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1967","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On radio-wave propagation in forest environments","publicationDate":"November 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On radio-wave propagation in forest environments","sourcePdf":"01139054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029392S","chronDate":"November  1967","isNumber":"25448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"153","articleId":"1139054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":1139097,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Each antenna element is assumed to have a cosine type of field pattern. It is found that such an array is capable of providing complete hemispherical coverage without appreciable loss of gain. The radiation produced by the array stays circularly polarized in all directions, and the state of polarization is independent of beam steering. A special distribution of elements on a spherical surface is developed. This considerably suppresses the grating lobes in the pattern and thereby makes the antenna array broadband.

The conditions for the occurrence of a surface wave effect, corresponding to a total array mismatch or a null in the element pattern, are derived in general for arrays having an adjustable short-circuited parasitic element (such as a corrugation) with each driven element.

The effect of the deviation of the illumination from the optimum upon the efficiency is numerically evaluated. The result shows that the reduction of the efficiency for a constant deviation increases as the Fresnel number decreases. The dissimilarity of both aperture illuminations also reduces the efficiency. The qualitative trend is such that the larger the dissimilarity, the smaller the efficiency.

The results are general and apply to bistatic as well as backscatter, and are valid for finitely as well as perfectly conducting surface materials.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Rough Surface Scattering Based on the Specular Point Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rough Surface Scattering Based on the Specular Point Theory","sourcePdf":"01139220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058817S","chronDate":"Jul 1968","isNumber":"25456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"273","articleId":"1139220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1139243,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The calculations show that the scattering has a resonant nature, i.e., only certain Fourier components of the surface shape are responsible for scattering in every given direction. Experiments carried out in a water basin confirmed the results of the calculations. The backscattered intensity is proportional to the spectral density of those Fourier components of the surface oscillation that have a resonant space period. In these experiments, resonant maxima of the reflected signal corresponding to the second-order approximation of the perturbation method were also observed. The frequency spectrum of the scattered electromagnetic field is also investigated. It is shown that the spectrum of the scattered radiation is shifted from the incident frequency by a certain value related to the phase velocity of the resonantly scattering Fourier component of the surface shape. The experimentally observed dependence of the scattered intensity on frequency and the theoretically predicted one are very much alike.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very high frequency radiowave scattering by a disturbed sea surface Part I: Scattering from a slightly disturbed boundary","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1968.1139243","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25457/01139243.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1968.1139243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25457","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1139243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1968","displayDocTitle":"Very high frequency radiowave scattering by a disturbed sea surface Part I: Scattering from a slightly disturbed boundary","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very high frequency radiowave scattering by a disturbed sea surface Part I: Scattering from a slightly disturbed boundary","sourcePdf":"01139243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052967S","chronDate":"Sep 1968","isNumber":"25457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"164","articleId":"1139243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1139244,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Both analog and digital phase shifters are treated in the analysis. It is shown that, irrespective of the type of phase shifter, the mismatch from element to element at a fixed scan angle is not identical. This variation is explained in terms of the multiple reflections that take place between the two surfaces of the lens. Further, as a function of scan angle, the element mismatch for a digitally phased array lens does not vary in a smooth manner but exhibits a decided ripple.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25458/01139270.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1968.1139270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1968.1139270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1139270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of phased array lenses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Lenses","Phase shifters","Impedance","Mutual coupling","Power transmission lines","Antenna arrays","Voltage","Reflection","Distributed parameter circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lens antennas","Phased arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1968","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of phased array lenses","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of phased array lenses","sourcePdf":"01139270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04007S","chronDate":"Nov 1968","isNumber":"25458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1139270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1139296,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Unlike past treatments of mutual coupling, which have proceeded from structurally specified antennas, the present treatment deals with a class of antennas, all the electromagnetic properties of which are rigorously expressed explicitly in terms of their radiation patterns alone. Employing a network formulation based on a scattering representation of electromagnetic fields in terms of spherical (or cylindrical) modes, the mutual impedances between such antennas are computed exactly. Several alternate representations for the mutual impedance are derived, one of which is an integral representation involving the power pattern function for both real and complex angles. In special cases, these exact results agree with published results obtained by applying well-known approximate techniques to structurally specified antennas. An important and illuminating example is provided by an infinite planar array of antennas radiating into a half-space for which the present formulation yields the well-known grating-lobe series representation of the active impedance without an explicit reference to structural properties of the radiating elements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1970.1139649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25478/01139649.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1970.1139649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of mutual coupling among minimum-scattering antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1970","displayDocTitle":"Theory of mutual coupling among minimum-scattering antennas","volume":"18","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139649/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of mutual coupling among minimum-scattering antennas","sourcePdf":"01139649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036491S","chronDate":"March  1970","isNumber":"25478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"95","articleId":"1139649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1139650,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The phase data at the two radio frequencies exhibited nearly identical power spectra from 0.01 to 5 Hz and very high coherence from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz. The coherence dropped rapidly above 0.1 Hz and was in most cases less than 0.4 above 0.5 Hz. The power spectra of fading were similar in shape at the two frequencies, but the fading spectral density was consistently higher at 34.52 GHz than at 9.6 GHz from 0.1 to 5 Hz.

For the case of a wave incident normally on a rectangular lattice array of narrow rectangular plates, the calculated values are in excellent agreement with the measurements in a previously published paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering by a two-dimensional periodic array of conducting plates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1970.1139760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25481/01139760.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1970.1139760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1139760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1970","displayDocTitle":"Scattering by a two-dimensional periodic array of conducting plates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering by a two-dimensional periodic array of conducting plates","sourcePdf":"01139760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073532S","chronDate":"Sep 1970","isNumber":"25481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"150","articleId":"1139760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1139767,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In preliminary tests, the possibility of designing an antenna having any mean surface, any feeder, and any given radiation pattern by means of holographic technique, is shown. One of the practical problems which is encountered in microwave holography is the construction of the hologram, which requires the antenna to be synthesized. For this purpose, a series of holograms have been constructed and tested based on different approximations of the interference pattern. Another problem encountered is the presence of unwanted orders.

The extension of ray optics to lossy inhomogeneous media does not exhibit such properties, in general, since the equations defining the paths of rays connecting real source and observation points yield complex values of the space coordinates, i.e., complex rays. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the local and sequential propagation characteristics of fields in an inhomogeneous lossy medium, and to assertain the significance of the complex rays. The simplest configuration suited to this purpose is a planar interface between homogeneous lossless and lossy half-spaces. By studying the shadowing effects produced at an observation point by sampling windows placed in planes crossed by the field, one finds the region through which the field principally propagates to the observation point, and there-from the local and sequential properties.

It is shown that, with proper constraints on the sidelobes, a given performance index can be optimized to give a radiation pattern with desired sidelobe levels. As most of the performance indices of an array antenna can be expressed as a ratio of two Hermitian quadratic forms, an eigenvalue method is used for the constrained optimization. This method gives explicit expressions for the excitation vector and constrained values of the performance indices. An iterative technique is used to ensure that the specified field values occur at the sidelobe peak positions. The element excitations obtained by this technique for maximum gain and uniform sidelobe level are similar to these obtained by the Dolph-Chebyshev technique.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1971.1139955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25492/01139955.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1971.1139955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained optimization of the performance indices of arbitrary array antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1139955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139955/","displayDocTitle":"Constrained optimization of the performance indices of arbitrary array antennas","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained optimization of the performance indices of arbitrary array antennas","sourcePdf":"01139955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119601S","chronDate":"Jul 1971","isNumber":"25492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1139955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1139995,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The resonant frequency and the bandwidth may be controlled by varying the length, spacing, and load impedance of the dipoles (slots). A theoretical and experimental investigation of the scattering by a two-dimensional array of loaded dipoles is described. The scattering through the resonance region shows that a unit reflection coefficient is achieved. The effect of grating-lobe radiation is included. The scattering properties as a function of the angle of incidence are given for both loaded and unloaded dipoles. The loaded dipole array described in this paper produces a narrower bandwidth than the array of unloaded dipoles, and the resonant frequency is much less dependent on the angle of incidence. The resonant frequency of the array as well as the bandwidth depends strongly on the resonant frequency of the dipole element as would be expected; however, it is also substantially influenced by the interelement spacing and the angle of incidence.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1971.1139995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel6/8/25493/01139995.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1971.1139995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflection properties of periodic surfaces of loaded dipoles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1139995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1139995/","displayDocTitle":"Reflection properties of periodic surfaces of loaded dipoles","volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reflection properties of periodic surfaces of loaded dipoles","sourcePdf":"01139995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040752S","chronDate":"Sep 1971","isNumber":"25493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"105","articleId":"1139995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1139999,"authors":[{"name":"R.
