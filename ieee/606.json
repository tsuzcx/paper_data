This channel state information (CSI) based key generation method relies on spatial independence between the legitimate and eavesdropping channels. In this paper, we propose a methodology to extract secret keys through side-channel information. Our methodology involves the capture of side-channel information leaked by the electronic instruments, either when measuring channel characteristics or during encryption/decryption for key confirmation. Secret keys are extracted via analysis of the side-channel information. We provide experiment results to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed side-channel attack methodology.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059944","startPage":"264","endPage":"268","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044613/6059944/06060012.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel state information based key generation vs. side-channel analysis key information leakage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Wireless communication","Timing","Elliptic curve cryptography","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information","key generation","side-channel analysis key information leakage","CSI","spatial independence","electronic instruments","encryption-decryption","wireless channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information (CSI)","secret key","side-channel analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel state information based key generation vs. side-channel analysis key information leakage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060012/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060012/","accessionNumber":"12342921","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel state information based key generation vs. side-channel analysis key information leakage","confLoc":"Milan","sourcePdf":"NSS2011Short09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057499S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044613","isNumber":"6059944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044613","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6059944","articleId":"6060012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":6060013,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph B\u00f6hm","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"B\u00f6hm","id":"38020470600"},{"name":"Maximilian Hofer","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Hofer","id":"38028662500"},{"name":"Wolfgang Pribyl","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Pribyl","id":"37328460800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0460-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0458-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0459-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6060013","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Microcontrollers","Correlation","Error analysis","Error correction codes","Semiconductor device measurement","Ash"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","microcontrollers","security of data","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM-PUF microcontroller","physical unclonable function","static random access memory","SRAM cell power-up state","internal SRAM block","error correction code","repetition factor","key storage","repetition code","temperature 0 degC to 80 degC"]}],"abstract":"Key storage is a well-known security issue. Usually, keys are generated and then stored in an non-volatile memory (NVM). A promising alternative are the so-called physical unclonable functions (PUFs). These functions extract key material directly from manufacturing variabilities of a device. One example of such a PUF is the SRAM-PUF. It uses the power-up states of SRAM cells to generate an ID/key. In this paper we present an SRAM PUF which we implemented on a microcontroller using the internal SRAM blocks. Combined with a simple error correction code, namely the repetition code, we could reduce the error rates to small values. Using a repetition factor of 31 we reached a probability for one or more errors within a 2048bit key of lower than 7e-7 within a temperature range from 0C to 80C. The low costs and the simplicity of implementation makes the SRAM-PUF on a microcontroller an attractive alternative to common approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060013","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044613/6059944/06060013.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microcontroller SRAM-PUF","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060013/","displayDocTitle":"A microcontroller SRAM-PUF","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060013/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12342922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microcontroller SRAM-PUF","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"NSS2011Short10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058771S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044613","isNumber":"6059944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044613","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6059944","articleId":"6060013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6060015,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Alsouri","affiliation":["Security Engineering Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Alsouri","id":"38016847500"},{"name":"Stefan Katzenbeisser","affiliation":["Security Engineering Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Katzenbeisser","id":"37401986500"},{"name":"Sebastian Biedermann","affiliation":["Security Engineering Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Biedermann","id":"38554861400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0460-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0458-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0459-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6060015","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Outsourcing","Security","Hardware","Web services","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","security of data","software architecture","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trustable outsourcing","business process","cloud computing","Internet-based service","cost-effective outsourcing","virtualization technology","Xen","ODE process engine"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing, the next generation of Internet-based services, will allow cost-effective outsourcing of applications and business processes. However, outsourcing business processes to potentially untrusted servers poses significant security and privacy problems. Despite having no direct control over the hardware platform on which the business processes run, clients still need to obtain assurance of correct execution. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on Trusted Computing technologies that allows fine-granular and policy-based remote attestation of outsourced business processes running on remote hosts. In particular, we let the provider generate, during execution of the business process, secure execution logs that allow to verify correct execution of the process at a later time by the client. Our architecture allows a cloud provider to host business processes for multiple tenants, considering at the same time multi-instance processes. We show how such an architecture can be implemented using Trusted Computing technologies, traditional virtualization technologies like Xen and the ODE process engine.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060015","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6044613/6059944/06060015.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6060015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trustable outsourcing of business processes to cloud computing environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060015/","displayDocTitle":"Trustable outsourcing of business processes to cloud computing environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12342924","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060015/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trustable outsourcing of business processes to cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"NSS2011Short12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064675S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6044613","isNumber":"6059944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6044613","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6059944","articleId":"6060015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6060046,"authors":[{"name":"I.

When such a limit is exceeded, the transmitter creates extra in-band and adjacent-band interferences that were not considered by the conventional resource allocation algorithms, and thus invalidate the optimality of resource allocation. We therefore propose a novel optimization strategy in resource allocation under the peak power constraint. An adaptive iterative resource allocation scheme is developed that maximizes the system throughput and does not create any extra in-band and adjacent-band interferences.

For acquisition, the proposed algorithm uses a preamble sequence that allows for joint CFO and CG estimation. The proposed method is based on MAP techniques. We demonstrate that the estimation of the CFO from the preamble is sufficiently accurate such that there is no need to subsequently refine this estimate value from the payload. Then, the obtained CFO estimate is used to compensate for the CFO prior to performing the CG tracking.

It also partitions the remaining pipes into several blocks with elements of similar magnitude to reduce complexity by exploiting the matrix property after sorted QR decomposition. Finally, the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding is used to get rid of multiple access interference and inter-antenna interference in advance at transmitters. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme is competitive to block-based geometric mean decomposition systems with much reduced arithmetic complexity.

Although the decision feedback method can be used for channel tracking, the well-known error propagation problem can seriously degrade the system performance. In our work, the semi-blind channel tracking method applies a decision error criterion to adaptively change the use of the error control signal between the constant modulus algorithm and the decision feedback in order to avoid the error propagation problem.

With good sensing capability, secondary users can effectively recycle the spectrum resource without disturbing active primary users. Energy detector (ED) is a commonly used and relatively simple spectrum sensing technique. In realistic environments, the CR receiver might operate at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes due to the channel fading and noise uncertainty. At low SNR cases, the performance of the EDs degrades dramatically as the signal and noise are mixed together after the operation of energy calculation. In this paper, a high-order statistics (HOS) based sequential test detector is investigated to sense the underutilized spectrum, particularly for low-SNR applications. We resort to HOS, in terms of cumulant statistics, for overwhelming the Gaussian noise effect and improving the spectrum sensing reliability. Based on these cumulants, a binary hypothesis testing problem is formulated and a low-complexity sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is developed for efficiently and fast detecting the vacant spectrum so as to meet the sensing duration requirements. Our numerical results show that the proposed detector outperforms the conventional EDs at extremely low SNR environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12341024","htmlLink":"/document/6060144/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Higher-order statistics based sequential spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher-order statistics based sequential spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p696hsieh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057971S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045283","isNumber":"6060032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045283","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6060032","articleId":"6060144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6060146,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Yi Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yi","lastName":"Chang","id":"38023294700"},{"name":"Yu-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ting","lastName":"Sun","id":"38006692600"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Ku","id":"37602473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-671-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-668-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-670-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6060146","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Multiple signal classification","Estimation","Bandwidth","Receivers","Frequency domain analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","mean square error methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","signal classification","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["root-MUSIC algorithms","carrier frequency offset","CFO estimation methods","carrier-aggregated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","CA-OFDM systems","spectrum policy","carrier aggregation","bandwidth extension","detection error rate","mean square error method","multipath time-varying channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier aggregation","MUSIC algorithms","root-MUSIC algorithms","OFDM","CFO estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a very promising technique for high data rate transmission in multipath channels. In general, the achievable data rate of an OFDM system is confined by the available bandwidth, which strongly depends on the spectrum policy. Carrier aggregation is an attractive and flexible bandwidth extension technique which allows for upgrading data rates by aggregating several contiguous or non-contiguous carriers. Different from the conventional OFDM systems, multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) have to be taken into account in carrier-aggregated OFDM (CA-OFDM) systems. In this paper, a set of preambles is constructed as pilots for component carriers. Based on the received preambles, we investigate novel multiple CFOs estimation methods using MUSIC or root-MUSIC algorithms to find multiple CFOs. Two CFOs mapping methods are then proposed to map the estimated CFOs to the corresponding component carriers. Simulation results show the proposed method can get good performance, in terms of the detection error rate and mean square error (MSE) in multipath time-varying channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MUSIC-based multiple CFOs estimation methods for CA-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2011.6060146","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045283/6060032/06060146.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2011.6060146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6060032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"MUSIC-based multiple CFOs estimation methods for CA-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060146/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341026","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MUSIC-based multiple CFOs estimation methods for CA-OFDM systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p702chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060825S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045283","isNumber":"6060032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045283","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6060032","articleId":"6060146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6060150,"authors":[{"name":"Shiann-Tsong Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shiann-Tsong","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37301630800"},{"name":"Chun-Hsiang Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hsiang","lastName":"Chiu","id":"38023158800"},{"name":"Shaojung Lu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shaojung","lastName":"Lu","id":"38008376300"},{"name":"Hsien-Hao Lai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsien-Hao","lastName":"Lai","id":"38023410700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-671-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-668-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-670-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6060150","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Data communication","Servers","Protocols","Performance evaluation","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data transmission scheme","MTC communications","LTE system","machine type communication","cellular network","long term evolution","radio access network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","MTC","M2M","machine type communication","radio network overload"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060150","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2011.6060150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2011.6060150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6060032","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045283/6060032/06060150.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient data transmission scheme for MTC communications in LTE system","abstract":"Machine type communication (MTC) is becoming an important part of the cellular network, such as long-term-evolution (LTE) network.

This application requires information from vehicles in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) areas due to building at intersection corners. The periodic Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) are foreseen to be sent via 5.9 GHz IEEE 802.11p. While it is known that existing micro-cell models might not apply well, validated propagation models for vehicular 5.9 GHz NLOS conditions are still missing. In this paper, we develop a 5.9 GHz NLOS path-loss and fading model based on real-world measurements at a representative selection of intersections in the city of Munich. We show that a) the measurement data can very well be fitted to an analytical model, b) the model incorporates specific geometric aspects in closed-form as well as normally distributed fading in NLOS, and c) the model is of low complexity, thus, could be used in large-scale packet-level simulations. A comparison to existing micro-cell models shows that our model significantly differs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045283/6060032/06060156.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2011.6060156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2011.6060156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6060032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A validated 5.9 GHz Non-Line-of-Sight path-loss and fading model for inter-vehicle communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Fading","Vehicles","Equations","Receivers","Transmitters","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcellular radio","microwave measurement","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonline-of-sight path-loss","fading model","intervehicle communication","cross-traffic assistance","intersection corners","cooperative awareness messages","CAM","IEEE 802.11p","microcell models","propagation models","NLOS path-loss","measurement data","analytical model","large-scale packet-level simulations","frequency 5.9 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5.9 GHz","V2V","Non-Line-Of-Sight","Path-Loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A validated 5.9 GHz Non-Line-of-Sight path-loss and fading model for inter-vehicle communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060156/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341036","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A validated 5.9 GHz Non-Line-of-Sight path-loss and fading model for inter-vehicle communication","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p75mangel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050682S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045283","isNumber":"6060032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045283","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6060032","articleId":"6060156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6060287,"authors":[{"name":"Hidehiko Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidehiko","lastName":"Okada","id":"37574781300"},{"name":"Tetsuya Wada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Wada","id":"38019393300"},{"name":"Akira Yamashita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"38019536600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-907764-39-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0714-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-907764-38-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6060287","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Games","Conferences","Particle swarm optimization","Tuning","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RoboCup soccer player formations","evolutionary algorithms","particle swarm optimization","team performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","RoboCup soccer simulation league","autonomous agent","evolutionary algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060287","abstract":"Researchers have applied evolutionary algorithms to RoboCup Soccer players/teams and evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm in evolving good players and teams, but further investigations are required to know more about the ability of the algorithms.

However, the initial structure for the LTS is difficult to determine. Hence, in this paper SVR apply to determine the initial LTS. That is, due to a SVR approach with the \u03b5-insensitive loss function provides an estimated function within \u03b5 zone, the initial structure of the LT S can be obtained by the SVR approach that justly provides better initialization to robust against training data with outliers and noise. After the SVR based LTS, the gradient-descent kind of learning algorithms is used as the learning algorithm to adjust the weights of the CPBUM neural networks.

These changes are often achieved by techniques such as linear programming or geometric programming. We present a systematic approach composing multiple utility-directed transformations for optimizing and mapping a sequential design onto a customizable parallel computing platform such as a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our aim is to enable automatic design optimization at compile time. Design goals specified by users drive the design transformations. Each utility-directed transformation achieves part of the overall goal, and multiple utility-directed transformations, connected by pattern-directed transformations, are composed to fulfill the overall design requirements. The utility-directed transformations in this work produce performance-optimized designs by exploiting data reuse, MapReduce, and pipelining for the target parallel computing platform. Moreover, it is shown that performing transformations in different orders allows users to trade speed for resources, and design performance for compile time. Several applications are used to evaluate this approach on FPGAs. The system performance of a 64-bit matrix multiplication is shown to improve up to 98 times compared to the original design, in the target hardware platform.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.205","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6338972/06060798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6338972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1800","endPage":"1812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Hardware Design by Composing Utility-Directed Transformations","volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6060798/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13100132","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Hardware Design by Composing Utility-Directed Transformations","sourcePdf":"ttc2012121800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132497S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6338972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6338972","articleId":"6060798","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6060809,"authors":[{"name":"Shui Yu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Shui","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405530700"},{"name":"Wanlei Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Wanlei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37271785700"},{"name":"Weijia Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Jia","id":"37266130300"},{"name":"Song Guo","affiliation":["Performance Evaluation Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274156400"},{"name":"Yong Xiang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37286573200"},{"name":"Feilong Tang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feilong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37268407400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"6060809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":123,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2705},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Computer crime","Correlation","Communities","Delay","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DDoS attack","Internet","botnets","traffic pattern","flash crowds","discrimination algorithm","flow correlation coefficient","similarity metric","suspicious flows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DDoS attacks","flash crowds","similarity","discrimination."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060809","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6189836/06060809.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.262","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating DDoS Attacks from Flash Crowds Using Flow Correlation Coefficient","abstract":"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a critical threat to the Internet, and botnets are usually the engines behind them.

Consequently, an attacker who succeeds in forging multiple hostile identifies can easily launch a Sybil attack, gaining a disproportionately large influence. In this paper, we propose a novel Sybil attack detection mechanism, Footprint, using the trajectories of vehicles for identification while still preserving their location privacy. More specifically, when a vehicle approaches a road-side unit (RSU), it actively demands an authorized message from the RSU as the proof of the appearance time at this RSU. We design a location-hidden authorized message generation scheme for two objectives: first, RSU signatures on messages are signer ambiguous so that the RSU location information is concealed from the resulted authorized message; second, two authorized messages signed by the same RSU within the same given period of time (temporarily linkable) are recognizable so that they can be used for identification. With the temporal limitation on the linkability of two authorized messages, authorized messages used for long-term identification are prohibited.

This study focuses on the challenge of increasing the capacity of a wireless network by enabling multiple transmissions in each available channel. Active transmitters are assumed to maintain the receiver signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) at a predetermined target value via power control to promote the quality of wireless connections. To this end, we propose distributed medium access algorithms that allow every transmitter-receiver pair to determine whether a target SINR is physically achievable through iterative power control in a given shared channel. The proposed algorithms are shown by theoretical analysis to be fast, accurate, and energy efficient. Numerical simulations demonstrate their ability to outperform related medium access schemes based on random access, carrier sensing, controlled power up, or invariant channel probing. Our major contribution consists of solving the open problem of accurate real-time computation of the spectral radius of an unknown network information matrix. This makes our framework applicable not only to testing target SINR achievability, but also to other aspects of wireless engineering such as energy efficiency, power control stability, and handover prioritization, in which knowledge of the spectral radius plays a key role.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6335093/06060834.pdf","startPage":"2087","endPage":"2097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6335093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Distributed Algorithms for Dynamic Access to Shared Multiuser Channels in SINR-Constrained Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Power control","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Iterative decoding","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel capacity","distributed algorithms","energy conservation","interference suppression","iterative methods","matrix algebra","multiuser channels","power control","radio access networks","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic access","shared multiuser channel","SINR","wireless network","active transmitter","communication channel","channel capacity","receiver","signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio","wireless connection quality","distributed medium access algorithm","iterative power control","numerical simulation","random access","carrier sensing","invariant channel probing","network information matrix","energy efficiency","spectral radius"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic channel reuse","channel probing","distributed iterative power control","stability","spectral radius"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Distributed Algorithms for Dynamic Access to Shared Multiuser Channels in SINR-Constrained Wireless Networks","volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6060834/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13064171","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Distributed Algorithms for Dynamic Access to Shared Multiuser Channels in SINR-Constrained Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012122087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082449S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6335093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6335093","articleId":"6060834","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6060835,"authors":[{"name":"Namik Kocaman","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6060835/6060835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Namik Kocaman (S'95\u2013M'97) received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 1995, and the M.S. degree from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1997, both in electrical engineering.

Such networks consist in Cartesian grids of digitally-controlled oscillator nodes, where each node communicates only with its nearest neighbors. Under certain conditions, we show that the whole network may synchronize both in phase and frequency. A key aspect of this study lies in the fact that, in the absence of an absolute reference clock, the loop-filter in each ADPLL is operated on the irregular rising edges of the local oscillator and consequently, does not use the same operands depending on whether the local clock is leading or lagging. Under simple assumptions, these networks of so-called \"self-sampled\" all-digital phase-locked-loops (SS-ADPLLs) can be described as piecewise-linear systems, the stability of which is notoriously difficult to establish. The main contribution of this paper is a simple design rule that must be met by the coefficients of each loop-filter in order to achieve synchronization in a Cartesian network of arbitrary size. Transient simulations indicate that this necessary synchronization condition may also be sufficient for a specific (but important) class of SS-ADPLLs. A synthesis of the different approaches that have been conducted in the study of the synchronization of SS-ADPLLs is also done.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6174505/06060838.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6174505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization Analysis of Networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Stability analysis","Circuit stability","Phase locked loops","Clocks","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock distribution networks","digital filters","digital phase locked loops","phase locked oscillators","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-sampled all-digital phase-locked loop","synchronization analysis","Cartesian network","identical all-digital phase-locked loop","identical ADPLL","clock distribution application","Cartesian grid","digitally-controlled oscillator node","absolute reference clock","loop-filter","SS-ADPLL","piecewise-linear system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","digital circuits","nonlinear network analysis","phase-locked loops","synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization Analysis of Networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6060838/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638983","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization Analysis of Networks of Self-Sampled All-Digital Phase-Locked Loops","sourcePdf":"tcsi-juillard-2169745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069437S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6174505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6174505","articleId":"6060838","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060839,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this work, we model the impact of this effect on IBG spectral responses and we identify key parameters that need to be controlled in order to minimize distortions. We show that only low spatial frequency components of the noise are relevant to the calculation of the IBG spectral response, which decreases considerably the computation time. Furthermore, we present an IBG emulator that allows estimation of expected fabrication yield of specific gratings given that the fabrication process is well characterized. The analysis of apodized gratings is used as an example to illustrate how this modeling can help to reduce development cost by first studying robustness of IBG designs to fabrication limitations. Finally, we study analytically the impact of sidewall roughness having short correlation lengths and small roughness variances on the spectral response of weak gratings.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2173556","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6093615/06060839.pdf","startPage":"3693","endPage":"3704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2173556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Sidewall Roughness on Integrated Bragg Gratings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Sidewall Roughness on Integrated Bragg Gratings","volume":"29","issue":"24","accessionNumber":"12403239","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6060839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Sidewall Roughness on Integrated Bragg Gratings","sourcePdf":"jlt-dsimard-2173556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082326S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6093615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6093615","articleId":"6060839","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060840,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Dupuis","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nicolas Dupuis received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Blaise Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, France, and the Ph.D. degree from Paul Verlaine University, Metz, France, in 2008, all in physics.","During his Ph.D. studies, he worked with Alcatel-Thales III-V Lab, Marcoussis, France, on the modeling and development of the selective area growth technic for InP-based photonic integrated circuit.

In some applications, such as sensor network with low transmission rate sensors, it is necessary that the sampling rate to be under the Nyquist rate; in this case, a frequency determination method based on its under-sampled waveform is needed. Several studies have been done to extract real input frequency from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. This paper presents a novel method for unambiguous and unique frequency determination of under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. The proposed method needs a low cost hardware in compare with the frequency determination of under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. First, we determine the upper frequency bound which the frequency can be extracted unambiguously from under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform. Then, in order to extract real input frequency unambiguously and uniquely, the maximum tolerable amount of frequency error is determined from under-sampled sinusoidal real waveform. Moreover, we improve the previous method for frequency determination from under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform. Finally, performance of the proposed schemes is verified by some simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hardware","Noise","Upper bound","Digital signal processing","Synthetic aperture radar","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency measurement","sensors","signal processing","waveform generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital frequency determination","real waveforms","multiple sensors","low sampling rates","Nyquist rate","low transmission rate sensors","under-sampled sinusoidal complex waveform","upper frequency bound","maximum tolerable amount","frequency error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sampling","compressive sensing","real waveform sampling","sensor networks","sub-Nyquist sampling","unambiguous frequency determination","under-sampled real sinusoidal waveform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2011.2173482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6178352/06060848.pdf","startPage":"1483","endPage":"1495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2173482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Frequency Determination of Real Waveforms Based on Multiple Sensors With Low Sampling Rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Frequency Determination of Real Waveforms Based on Multiple Sensors With Low Sampling Rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060848/","volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060848/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12650345","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Frequency Determination of Real Waveforms Based on Multiple Sensors With Low Sampling Rates","sourcePdf":"jsen-khaleghibizaki-2173482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083205S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"6060848","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6060862,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Frihauf","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6187742/6060862/6060862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul Frihauf (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in systems science and engineering from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 2005.

In classical game theory algorithms, each player employs the knowledge of the functional form of his payoff and the knowledge of the other players' actions, whereas in the proposed algorithm, the players need to measure only their own payoff values. This strategy is based on the extremum seeking approach, which has previously been developed for standard optimization problems and employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the gradient. We consider static games with quadratic payoff functions before generalizing our results to games with non-quadratic payoff functions that are the output of a dynamic system. Specifically, we consider general nonlinear differential equations with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n inputs and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n outputs, where in the steady state, the output signals represent the payoff functions of a noncooperative game played by the steady-state values of the input signals. We employ the standard local averaging theory and obtain local convergence results for both quadratic payoffs, where the actual convergence is semi-global, and non-quadratic payoffs, where the potential existence of multiple Nash equilibria precludes semi-global convergence. Our convergence conditions coincide with conditions that arise in model-based Nash equilibrium seeking. However, in our framework the user is not meant to check these conditions because the payoff functions are presumed to be unknown. For non-quadratic payoffs, convergence to a Nash equilibrium is not perfect, but is biased in proportion to the perturbation amplitudes and the higher derivatives of the payoff functions. We quantify the size of these residual biases and confirm their existence numerically in an example noncooperative game. In this example, we present the first application of extremum seeking with projection to ensure that the players' actions remain in a given closed and bounded action set.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2173412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6187742/06060862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6187742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2173412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Noncooperative Games","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Noncooperative Games","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060862/","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6060862/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12688842","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Noncooperative Games","sourcePdf":"tac-frihauf-2173412-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114361S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6187742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"6187742","articleId":"6060862","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6060873,"authors":[{"name":"Osama N.

In this paper, we generalize the derivation of the antenna pattern basis functions regarding a three-element SPA of arbitrary radiating elements, within a symmetric array topology, for multiplexing signals in the wavevector domain (using different beampatterns) rather than in the hardware antenna domain with multiple feeding ports. A fully operational antenna system example is modeled, optimized regarding its return loss and the power imbalance between the basis functions, and finally realized. The measurements of the SPA show good agreement with the simulated target values, revealing an accurate design approach to be adopted as a fast SPA prototyping methodology. The SPA has been successfully employed for multiplexing two binary phase-shift-keying (BPSK) datastreams over-the-air, thus paving the way for practically compact and highly efficient MIMO transceiver designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Source: Theory and Antenna Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060873.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Source: Theory and Antenna Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060873/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12508998","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Transmission Using a Single RF Source: Theory and Antenna Design","sourcePdf":"tap-alrabadi-2173429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081787S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060873","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060874,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Perentos","affiliation":["Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060874/6060874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicholas Perentos (M'09) received the Bachelor degree and the Ph.D. degree in engineering telecommunications from RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","In 2009, he joined the Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and in 2010 he joined the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., as a Research Fellow.

The communications performance is based on many assumptions, including that of linear channels. But in practice, key components such as microwave amplifiers are non-linear. This paper addresses MIMO compensation of non-linear amplifiers at both the transmitter and the receiver. The in-band distortion is modeled using Busgang's theorem. Based on this model, a decision algorithm obtains an optimized initial estimate of the transmitted symbols which are used for subsequent channel estimation. The final channel matrix estimate is obtained through two alternative methods: statistical linearization; or analytical linearization. The approach is blind in the sense that no pilots are used for sounding the channel. Performance is evaluated by simulation, allowing comparison with the benchmark of coherent detection with perfect channel knowledge. We establish the maximum SNR value for which the nonlinearities are essentially compensated. The performances of the two methods converge as the MIMO system becomes linear. The linear case allows fair comparison with known results of the conventional decision-directed Kalman filtering, and two pilot-aided systems. Finally we compare the performance with a look-up table technique for compensating the non-linearity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensating for Non-Linear Amplifiers in MIMO Communications Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060875.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Compensating for Non-Linear Amplifiers in MIMO Communications Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060875/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509000","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensating for Non-Linear Amplifiers in MIMO Communications Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-banani-2173441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11133S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060875","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060876,"authors":[{"name":"Peter R.

Maximum likelihood parameter estimation based upon an underlying data model is used to achieve high-resolution of the path parameters and, thus, renders possible an antenna independent channel characterization. However, any mismatch of the underlying data model to physical reality imposes limits to accuracy and reliability of the estimation. To cope with the limited resolution capability of the setup we are using a propagation data model that does not only contain discrete deterministic components but also a non-resolvable stochastic part. Joint estimation of both components considerably enhances the estimation quality and finally allows the interpretation as specular and diffuse contribution of multi-path propagation respectively. However, besides of noise influence, the achievable resolution is further limited by the accuracy of the data model that describes the measurement setup. Since the antenna characteristics are very susceptible to calibration and modeling errors, the directional estimates are most error-prone. We refer to the antenna array calibration procedure and discuss common pitfalls in high-resolution multi-path direction estimation that are related to inaccurate and/or incomplete device data model. Depending on the type of the antenna array (linear, circular) this will inherently produce biased and artificially spread angular estimates. Only with precise knowledge of the model errors the stochastic part can be identified as diffuse propagation component vs. modeling error.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060881.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Incomplete and Inaccurate Data Models on High Resolution Parameter Estimation in Multidimensional Channel Sounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060881/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Incomplete and Inaccurate Data Models on High Resolution Parameter Estimation in Multidimensional Channel Sounding","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060881/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Incomplete and Inaccurate Data Models on High Resolution Parameter Estimation in Multidimensional Channel Sounding","sourcePdf":"tap-kaske-2173446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124018S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060881","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6060882,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","School of Electro-magnetic Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden and the Center for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060882/6060882-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Li (S'08) received the Bachelor's degree in optical engineering from Tianjin University (TJU), China, in 2007.

Moreover, the ability of antenna elements to localize the excitation currents on the chassis can significantly influence the final performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a dual-band, dual-antenna terminal is designed to provide an isolation of over 10 dB for the 900 MHz band without additional matching or decoupling structures. A tradeoff analysis of bandwidth, efficiency, effective diversity gain and capacity is performed over different antenna locations. Finally, three fabricated prototypes verify the simulation results for representative cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristic Mode Based Tradeoff Analysis of Antenna-Chassis Interactions for Multiple Antenna Terminals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060882.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Characteristic Mode Based Tradeoff Analysis of Antenna-Chassis Interactions for Multiple Antenna Terminals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060882/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristic Mode Based Tradeoff Analysis of Antenna-Chassis Interactions for Multiple Antenna Terminals","sourcePdf":"tap-lau-2173438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111074S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060882","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060883,"authors":[{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060883/6060883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Buon Kiong Lau (S'00\u2013M'03\u2013SM'07) received the B.E. degree (with honors) from the University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia and the Ph.D. degree from Curtin University of Technology, Perth, in 1998 and 2003, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","During 2000 to 2001, he worked as a Research Engineer with Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden.

In the present paper, a simple and rigorous procedure for decoupling two closely coupled antennas with a parasitic scatterer is proposed. The parasitic scatterer, which can be an additional antenna, acts as a shield between two active antenna elements. In contrast to previous studies involving the use of parasitic scatterer for decoupling antennas, we demonstrate using antenna impedances the underlying decoupling mechanism for two arbitrary antennas. By a proper choice of parameters, perfect matching and decoupling can be obtained for a given antenna spacing without extending the overall area used, and without introducing additional decoupling networks. The price to pay is a reduction of bandwidth relative to that of widely spaced antennas, which is the case for other decoupling methods as well. Simulation and experimental results are used to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach on a two-monopole array with an antenna spacing of 0.1 wavelength. Finally, several practical considerations of the proposal are also presented, including the extension of the approach for more than two active antennas and its implementation in mobile terminals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060883.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple and Efficient Decoupling of Compact Arrays With Parasitic Scatterers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Antenna arrays","Transmission line measurements","Loaded antennas","Impedance","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic coupling","electromagnetic wave scattering","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact array","multiple antennas","mobile terminal","antenna signal","parasitic scatterer","active antenna element","decoupling antenna","antenna impedance","two-monopole array","antenna spacing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array mutual coupling","impedance matching","parasitic antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simple and Efficient Decoupling of Compact Arrays With Parasitic Scatterers","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060883/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple and Efficient Decoupling of Compact Arrays With Parasitic Scatterers","sourcePdf":"tap-lau-2173440-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110818S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060883","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060884,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyi Li","affiliation":["Research Center for Frontier Medical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060884/6060884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengyi Li was born in Xi'an, China, in February 1982.

Therefore, in this paper, using parasitic elements to reduce mutual coupling is studied. By adding parasitic elements a double-coupling path is introduced and it can create a reverse coupling to reduce mutual coupling. As an example, a dual-slot-element antenna with parasitic monopoles for mobile terminals is described. The discussion on channel capacity shows that the antenna can be considered as a good candidate for MIMO systems. Furthermore, based on the study of current distributions, it is concluded that the technique is sensitive to relative positions between parasitic elements, and relative positions between active element and parasitic element.

The work is based on measurements of the MIMO channel between two widely separated BSs in a micro-cellular setup, and six handsets located in an indoor environment. The measurements are done simultaneously in both the 773.5-778.5 MHz and 2250-2350 MHz bands, and from the two BSs. The handsets are realistic types and were measured both in free space and with twelve different users, using both one and two hands. The random capacities of the channels are evaluated in terms of outage capacity. For an SNR of 10 dB, median capacities in free space of about 4.4-4.7 bit/s/Hz for the low band and about 3.3-3.8 bit/s/Hz for the high band were found. The mean decrease in outage capacity due to the user was found to be up to about 2.2 bit/s/Hz, depending on the band and handset. More results are presented in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060885.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Influence on MIMO Channel Capacity for Handsets in Data Mode Operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephone sets","Antenna measurements","Antennas","MIMO","Channel capacity","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","smart phones","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user influence","MIMO channel capacity","data mode operation","handheld device","PDA","smartphone","microcellular setup","handsets","indoor environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","dual-band propagation","MIMO channels","optical link","propagation measurements","user-interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"User Influence on MIMO Channel Capacity for Handsets in Data Mode Operation","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060885/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509010","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Influence on MIMO Channel Capacity for Handsets in Data Mode Operation","sourcePdf":"tap-nielsen-2173435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132367S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060885","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060886,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Pelosi","affiliation":["Section of Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking (APNet), Department of Electronic Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060886/6060886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mauro Pelosi was born in 1982 and is from Picinisco, Italy.

We propose an alternative novel decoupling technique, investigating several multiple antenna configurations for small handsets through measurements and numerical simulations. The influence of different novel designs on performance metrics such as total loss, antenna isolation and envelope correlation coefficient are investigated. By varying antenna impedance bandwidth and antenna location with respect to the handset, both planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) and inverted F antennas (IFA) were investigated in different UMTS frequency bands in proximity with the user's body. Results show that antennas may experience very different losses and envelope correlation coefficients depending on their relative position with respect to the handset, as the influence of the user's hand is not symmetrical in most cases. Narrow-band antennas are inherently decoupled when integrated on the same handset, while also other parameters such as frequency duplex distance and interaction with the user's body influence the mutual coupling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060886.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Antenna Systems With Inherently Decoupled Radiators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Telephone sets","Resonant frequency","3G mobile communication","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antenna systems","inherently decoupled radiators","mutual coupling","decoupling technique","performance metrics","total loss","antenna isolation","antenna impedance bandwidth","antenna location","planar inverted F antenna","envelope correlation coefficients","narrow-band antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hand phantom","isolation","multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems","small antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Antenna Systems With Inherently Decoupled Radiators","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060886/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Antenna Systems With Inherently Decoupled Radiators","sourcePdf":"tap-pelosi-2173437-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092469S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060886","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060887,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Pinchera","affiliation":["DAEIMI, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060887/6060887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniele Pinchera (S'05\u2013M'08) received the Dr. Eng. degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and electronic engineering from the University of Cassino, Italy, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Cassino.

The antenna consists of a U-slot patch and eight shorting posts. Each edge of the square patch is connected to two shorting posts via PIN diodes. By switching between the different states of the PIN diodes, the proposed antenna can operate in either monopolar patch or normal patch mode in similar frequency ranges. Therefore, its radiation pattern can be switched between conical and boresight patterns electrically. In addition, the plane with the maximum power level of the conical pattern can be changed between two orthogonal planes. Owing to a novel design of the switch geometry, the antenna does not need dc bias lines. The measured overlapping impedance bandwidth (|S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n| <; -10 dB) of the two modes is 6.6% with a center frequency of 5.32 GHz. The measured radiation patterns agree well with simulated results. The antennas are incorporated in a 2 \u00d7 2 multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to demonstrate the improvement in system capacity. In the real-time MIMO-OFDM channel measurement, it is shown that compared to omnidirectional antennas, the pattern reconfigurable antennas can enhance the system capacity, with 17% improvement in a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario and 12% in a non-LOS (NLOS) scenario at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060888.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pattern Reconfigurable U-Slot Antenna and Its Applications in MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060888/","displayDocTitle":"A Pattern Reconfigurable U-Slot Antenna and Its Applications in MIMO Systems","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060888/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pattern Reconfigurable U-Slot Antenna and Its Applications in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-qin-2173439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089129S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060888","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060889,"authors":[{"name":"Saou-Wen Su","affiliation":["Network Access Strategic Business Unit, Lite-On Technology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060889/6060889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saou-Wen Su (S'05\u2013M'08) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on November 11, 1977.

The two monopoles are located on the two opposite corners of the system PCB and spaced apart by a small ground portion, which serves as a layout area for antenna feeding network and connectors for the use of standalone antennas as an optional scheme. It was found that by removing only 1.5 mm long inwards from the top edge in the small ground portion and connecting the two antennas therein with a thin printed line, the antenna port isolation can be effectively improved. The neutralization line in this study occupies very little board space, and the design requires no conventional modification to the ground plane for mitigating mutual coupling. The behavior of the neutralization line was rigorously analyzed, and the MIMO characteristics of the proposed antennas was also studied and tested in the reverberation chamber. Details of the constructed prototype are described and discussed in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060889.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printed MIMO-Antenna System Using Neutralization-Line Technique for Wireless USB-Dongle Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Impedance","Antenna feeds","Correlation","Reflection","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","printed circuits","reverberation chambers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed MIMO-antenna system","neutralization line technique","wireless USB-dongle application","printed multiple input multiple output antenna system","antenna port decoupling","PCB","antenna feeding network","printed line","antenna port isolation","ground plane","reverberation chamber","standalone antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2.4 GHz WLAN antennas","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas","neutralization line","printed monopole antennas","wireless USB-dongle antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Printed MIMO-Antenna System Using Neutralization-Line Technique for Wireless USB-Dongle Applications","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060889/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509014","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Printed MIMO-Antenna System Using Neutralization-Line Technique for Wireless USB-Dongle Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-su-2173450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062151S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060889","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6060890,"authors":[{"name":"Rashid Mehmood","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060890/6060890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rashid Mehmood (S'05) received the B.Sc. degree (cum laude) in communication systems engineering from the Institute of Space Technology (IST), Pakistan, in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Jacobs University Bremen (JUB), Bremen, Germany, in 2010.","From 2007 to 2008, he worked as a Research Associate at IST and supervised various undergraduate laboratories.

Performance is studied not only for a noise-limited single link, but also in the presence of interference and multiple RECAP-equipped users. The impact of loss and finite bandwidth on the operation of the RECAP is also considered. For the practical EIRP constraint, results show that a compact MIMO RECAP (1\u03bb\u00d71\u03bb) provides 30%-50% capacity improvement for a single link. It is also found that RECAPs are even more beneficial in interference-limited and multiuser scenarios, where capacity is increased by 50% to 800% depending on the severity of the interference, indicating that RECAPs are an attractive solution for future wireless systems employing aggressive spectral reuse.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060890.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Capacity Enhancement Using Parasitic Reconfigurable Aperture Antennas (RECAPs)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","MIMO","Feeds","Antenna arrays","Optimized production technology","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radio links","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO capacity enhancement","parasitic reconfigurable aperture antenna","RECAP","multiple-input multiple-output system","realistic thermal noise model","power constraint","average receive signal-to-noise ratio","maximum effective isotropic radiated power","average transmit power","noise-limited single link","interference-limited scenario","multiuser scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information rates","interference suppression","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","reconfigurable antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Capacity Enhancement Using Parasitic Reconfigurable Aperture Antennas (RECAPs)","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060890/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509015","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Capacity Enhancement Using Parasitic Reconfigurable Aperture Antennas (RECAPs)","sourcePdf":"tap-wallace-2173445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069383S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060890","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060891,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Webb","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of Europe Limited, Hayes, UK","Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060891/6060891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matthew Webb received the B.A. and M.

In this paper, measured outdoor MIMO propagation data is used to evaluate initially the distributions and statistics of the coherence of the eigenmodes of the channel, for a wide range of mobility scenarios and user devices. Then, the impact on link performance of the differing coherences in time and frequency is evaluated in terms of the feedback delay and spectral spacing of pilots in a practical feedback scheme used in mobile WiMAX. It is found that not only mobility and physical environment, but also the directivity of the antenna array affect the eigen-coherence and also, therefore, the performance of a feedback scheme. Bit-error rate and information capacity are both shown to be sensitive to increased feedback delay and pilot spacing, however, the closed-loop system always outperforms its open-loop counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","startPage":"674","endPage":"681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigen-Coherence and Link Performance of Closed-Loop 4G Wireless in Measured Outdoor MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Eigen-Coherence and Link Performance of Closed-Loop 4G Wireless in Measured Outdoor MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509016","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6060891/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigen-Coherence and Link Performance of Closed-Loop 4G Wireless in Measured Outdoor MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-webb-2173431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069463S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060891","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060892,"authors":[{"name":"Boyan Yanakiev","affiliation":["Antennas Propagation and Radio Networking section at the Department of Electronic Systems Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060892/6060892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Boyan Yanakiev received the B.S. degree in physics from Sofia University, Bulgaria, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in wireless communication from Aalborg University, Denmark, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current position is as an industrial Ph.D. student in cooperation with Molex Antenna Business Unit.

A metric for the efficiency of the MEA would help clarify the tradeoffs between compactness and performance. In a MIMO/diversity antenna, the total efficiency seen at each port directly affects the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the diversity branch. The SNR after diversity combining governs the performance of the diversity antenna system. In this paper, MEA efficiencies is therefore discussed and formulated in the context of mutual coupling and diversity combining. The impact of MEA efficiency on the diversity gain and the information theoretical capacity is also formulated and demonstrated using measurements of example MEAs. With these formulations, an equivalent number of idealized (lossless, uncorrelated, uncoupled, equal power) branches can be found for an MEA, and this defines the diversity order and the capacity order of the MEA. With this metric, the performance of different MEAs can be compared.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","startPage":"529","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Element Antenna Efficiency and its Impact on Diversity and Capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Element Antenna Efficiency and its Impact on Diversity and Capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060893/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509018","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6060893/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Element Antenna Efficiency and its Impact on Diversity and Capacity","sourcePdf":"tap-yun-2173444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09834S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060893","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060894,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6142627/6060894/6060894-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianfeng Zheng received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Researcher with the State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University.

On each of the total six faces of the cube, a three-port tri-polarization antenna is installed. All antennas adopt a metal backing configuration, so the ground of all antennas forms a well shield Faraday cage, in which other functional circuits can be installed. Experimental measurements were carried out to evaluate the performance of the antenna cube in different MIMO scenarios. The results show that MIMO systems with the proposed compact antenna cube outperform those with dipole antennas which occupy the same number of RF channels but with much larger space. When a vertical 3-dipole array, a horizontal 3-dipole array and a dual polarization antenna are used in the user end (UE), respectively, the capacity of the global selected MIMO systems with antenna cube is about 2.7, 4.6, and 2.9 bits/s/Hz more than the full MIMO systems with a vertical 3-dipole array as the access point (AP) antennas. It is 1.9, 3.9, and 2.0 bits/s/Hz more than the full MIMO systems with a vertical 5-dipole array as AP antennas. The performance differences between the MIMO systems using global and simplified selection circuits are small.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06060894.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Eighteen-Port Antenna Cube for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Dipole antennas","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","MIMO communication","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact eighteen-port antenna cube","compact antenna cube","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communications","three-port tri-polarization antenna","metal backing configuration","well shield Faraday cage","dipole antennas","RF channels","vertical 3-dipole array","horizontal 3-dipole array","dual polarization antenna","global selected MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna cube","antenna selection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","polarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Eighteen-Port Antenna Cube for MIMO Systems","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060894/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509019","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Eighteen-Port Antenna Cube for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2173449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101982S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6060894","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060895,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6066252/6060895/6060895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Yu (M'97\u2013SM'06) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Idaho, Moscow.","He is a Researcher in the Microsoft Speech Research Group, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA.

The system is based on a low cost/power/size smart architecture of off-the-shelf miniaturized vibration motors; the main novelty is that it is able to generate stimuli where both vibration amplitude and frequency as well as beat interference can be modulated. This paper is aimed at evaluating this system by investigating the capability of healthy volunteers to perceive\u2014on their forearms\u2014vibrations with different amplitudes and/or frequencies. In addition, the ability of subjects in spatially discriminating stimulations on three forearm sites and recognizing six different combinations of stimulations was also addressed. Results demonstrate that subjects were able to discriminate different force amplitudes exerted by the device (accuracies greater than 75%); when both amplitude and frequency were simultaneously varied, the pure discrimination of amplitude/frequency variation was affected by the variation of the other. Subjects were also able to discriminate with an accuracy of 93% three different sites and with an accuracy of 78% six different stimulation patterns.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Force","Frequency modulation","Interference","Prosthetics","Skin","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurophysiology","prosthetics","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature vibrotactile sensory substitution device","multifingered hand prosthetics","artificial touch sensor","sensory feedback","upper limb amputee","off-the-shelf miniaturized vibration motors","beat interference","healthy volunteer","forearm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial hands","haptic perception","sensory substitution","upper limb prosthetics","vibrotactile feedback"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Analysis of Variance","Artificial Limbs","Electric Stimulation","Feedback, Sensory","Fingers","Hand","Humans","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Touch","Vibration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2173342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6132598/06060896.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2173342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Miniature Vibrotactile Sensory Substitution Device for Multifingered Hand Prosthetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Miniature Vibrotactile Sensory Substitution Device for Multifingered Hand Prosthetics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060896/","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060896/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12477340","pubMedId":"22042125","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Miniature Vibrotactile Sensory Substitution Device for Multifingered Hand Prosthetics","sourcePdf":"tbme-cipriani-2173342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.287244S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6132598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6132598","articleId":"6060896","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6060907,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chung Cheng","affiliation":["Department of International Business Management, Tainan University of Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6176019/6060907/6060907-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Chung Cheng received the B.S. degree in business mathematics from Soochow University, Taiwan, the M.S. degree in statistics from National Central University, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in industrial and information management from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, in 1985, 1989, and 2008, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of International Business Management, Tainan University of Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.

The representation of fuzzy relations that are obtained from a fuzzy time series plays a key role in forecasting. Most of the works in the literature use the rule-based representation, which tends to encounter the problem of rule redundancy. A remedial forecasting model was recently proposed in which the relations were established based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). However, its forecasting performance generally deteriorates when encountering more zero probabilities owing to fewer fuzzy relationships that exist in the historical temporal data. This paper thus proposes an enhanced HMM-based forecasting model by developing a novel fuzzy smoothing method to overcome performance deterioration. To deal with uncertainty more appropriately, the roulette-wheel selection approach is applied to probabilistically determine the forecasting result. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through real-world forecasting experiments, and performance comparison with other benchmarks is conducted by a Monte Carlo method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting With a Probabilistic Smoothing Hidden Markov Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2173583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6176019/06060907.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2173583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting With a Probabilistic Smoothing Hidden Markov Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6060907/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639038","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting With a Probabilistic Smoothing Hidden Markov Model","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-li-2173583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121403S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6060907","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060911,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Caione","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6133473/6060911/6060911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlo Caione (M'10) received the M.S. degree from the University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy, and the M.A.S. degree in embedded systems design from Advanced Learning and Research Institute, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland, in 2008 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Visiting Researcher Student at the University of California, Berkeley.

Increasing network size poses significant data collection challenges, for what concerns sampling and transmission coordination as well as network lifetime. To tackle these problems, in-network compression techniques without centralized coordination are becoming important solutions to extend lifetime. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a large WSN, based on ZigBee protocol, is used for monitoring (e.g., building, industry, etc.). We propose a new algorithm for in-network compression aiming at longer network lifetime. Our approach is fully distributed: each node autonomously takes a decision about the compression and forwarding scheme to minimize the number of packets to transmit. Performance is investigated with respect to network size using datasets gathered by a real-life deployment. An enhanced version of the algorithm is also introduced to take into account the energy spent in compression. Experiments demonstrate that the approach helps finding an optimal tradeoff between the energy spent in transmission and data compression.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2173500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2173500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6133473/06060911.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Compressive Sampling for Lifetime Optimization in Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Compressive Sampling for Lifetime Optimization in Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12479099","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Compressive Sampling for Lifetime Optimization in Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-caione-2173500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070035S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6060911","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6060912,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Ramanandan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6157683/6060912/6060912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arvind Ramanandan received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Riverside, in 2011.","His research interests include aided inertial navigation, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping-based methods in mapping/navigation, near-real-time estimation, and alternative (non-Global Positioning System) aiding techniques."]},"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Ramanandan","id":"37541539500"},{"name":"Anning Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6157683/6060912/6060912-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Anning Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Riverside, in 2011.","Her research interests include integer ambiguity resolution and carrier-phase Differential Global Positioning System-aided inertial navigation."]},"firstName":"Anning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536173800"},{"name":"Jay A.

When the rover is known to be stationary, artificial \u201cstationary\u201d measurements (i.e., zero velocity and/or zero angular rate) may be imposed. This corrects the velocity, attitude, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) biases, which decreases the rate of drift of the position and attitude. Implementation requires reliable automated tests to detect periods when the vehicle is stationary. Due to cost concerns, methods that use sensors that are already on the vehicle are preferred. This paper reviews existing stationary detection methods and proposes a new frequency domain approach, using only IMU data, to detect stationarity, with specifications and analysis for land vehicles. The performance of this new approach is evaluated in both theory and practice. In addition, this paper presents analytic and numeric evaluations of the observability of the inertial navigation system (INS) error states with stationary updates. Improvements in localization performance in an INS with stationary detection and aiding is shown experimentally.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6157683/06060912.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2168818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2168818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inertial Navigation Aiding by Stationary Updates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Sensors","Velocity measurement","Discrete Fourier transforms","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","Accelerometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial navigation","radionavigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial navigation aiding","stationary updates","sensor-aided inertial navigation","roving body localization","rover","inertial measurement unit","automated test","stationary detection method","land vehicles","inertial navigation system error states"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inertial navigation","Kalman filters","observability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Inertial Navigation Aiding by Stationary Updates","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6060912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12557752","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inertial Navigation Aiding by Stationary Updates","sourcePdf":"tits-ramanandan-2168818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108176S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6157683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6157683","articleId":"6060912","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060913,"authors":[{"name":"Jalal Al-Obaedi","affiliation":["University of Salford, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6157683/6060913/6060913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jalal Al-Obaedi was born in Iraq in 1974.

A new iterative identification approach is proposed, where supervised and unsupervised learning are combined to optimize the structure of the LMN. For the purpose of fitting the cluster-centers to the process nonlinearity, the Gustafsson-Kessel (GK) fuzzy clustering, i.e., unsupervised learning, is applied. In combination with the LMN learning procedure, a new incremental method to define the number and the initial locations of the cluster centers for the GK clustering algorithm is proposed. Each data cluster corresponds to a local region of the process and is modeled with a local linear model. Since the validity functions are calculated from the fuzzy covariance matrices of the clusters, they are highly adaptable and thus the process can be described with a very sparse amount of local models, i.e., with a parsimonious LMN model. The proposed method for constructing the LMN is finally tested on a drug absorption spectral process and compared to two other methods, namely, Lolimot and Hilomot. The comparison between the experimental results when using each method shows the usefulness of the proposed identification algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2170093","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2170093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06060917.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear System Identification by Gustafson\u2013Kessel Fuzzy Clustering and Supervised Local Model Network Learning for the Drug Absorption Spectra Process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060917/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear System Identification by Gustafson\u2013Kessel Fuzzy Clustering and Supervised Local Model Network Learning for the Drug Absorption Spectra Process","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6060917/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12409291","pubMedId":"22042153","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear System Identification by Gustafson\u2013Kessel Fuzzy Clustering and Supervised Local Model Network Learning for the Drug Absorption Spectra Process","sourcePdf":"tnn-teslic-pt1-2170093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087374S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6060917","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6060918,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Wu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6060918/6060918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan-Wu Wang (M'10) was born in Huixian, China, 1976.

Though the dynamical behavior of each node is continuous-time, the communications between every two different nodes are discrete-time, i.e., they are active only at some discrete time instants. Moreover, the communication intervals between every two communication instants can be uncertain and variable. By choosing a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to govern the characteristics of the discrete communication instants and by utilizing a convex combination technique, a synchronization criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities with an upper bound for the communication intervals obtained. The results extend and improve upon earlier work. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed communication scheme. Some relationships between the allowable upper bound of communication intervals and the coupling strength of the network are illustrated through simulations on a fully connected network, a star-like network, and a nearest neighbor network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Couplings","Delay","Upper bound","Chaotic communication","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous systems","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous dynamical networks","discrete-time communications","piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","discrete communication","convex combination technique","synchronization criterion","linear matrix inequalities","upper bound","communication intervals","coupling strength","fully connected network","star-like network","nearest neighbor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex dynamical network","discrete-time communication","sampled-data system","synchronization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Communication Networks","Computer Simulation","Models, Theoretical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2171501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06060918.pdf","startPage":"1979","endPage":"1986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2171501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Continuous Dynamical Networks With Discrete-Time Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Continuous Dynamical Networks With Discrete-Time Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060918/","volume":"22","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060918/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12409292","pubMedId":"22042155","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Continuous Dynamical Networks With Discrete-Time Communications","sourcePdf":"tnn-wang-pt1-2171501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121861S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6060918","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6060919,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Ni","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6060919/6060919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianjun Ni (M'11) received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2005.","He was a Visiting Professor with the Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada, from November 2009 to October 2010.

To conduct the cooperative hunting by multirobots in unknown and dynamic environments, the robots not only need to take into account basic problems (such as searching, path planning, and collision avoidance), but also need to cooperate in order to pursue and catch the evaders efficiently. In this paper, a novel approach based on a bioinspired neural network is proposed for the real-time cooperative hunting by multirobots, where the locations of evaders and the environment are unknown and changing. The bioinspired neural network is used for cooperative pursuing by the multirobot team. Some other algorithms are used to enable the robots to catch the evaders efficiently, such as the dynamic alliance and formation construction algorithm. In the proposed approach, the pursuing alliances can dynamically change and the robot motion can be adjusted in real-time to pursue the evader cooperatively, to guarantee that all the evaders can be caught efficiently. The proposed approach can deal with various situations such as when some robots break down, the environment has different boundary shapes, or the obstacles are linked with different shapes. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of guiding the robots to achieve the hunting of multiple evaders in real-time efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06060919.pdf","startPage":"2062","endPage":"2077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2169808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2169808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bioinspired Neural Network for Real-Time Cooperative Hunting by Multirobots in Unknown Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Biological neural networks","Real time systems","Neurons","Multirobot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","multi-robot systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired neural network","multirobot","real-time cooperative hunting","multiple robot cooperation","cooperative pursuing","dynamic alliance","formation construction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bioinspired neural network","dynamic alliance","hunting problem","multirobot cooperation","unknown environment"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biomimetics","Computer Simulation","Computer Systems","Cooperative Behavior","Environment","Humans","Models, Theoretical","Nerve Net","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bioinspired Neural Network for Real-Time Cooperative Hunting by Multirobots in Unknown Environments","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6060919/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409293","pubMedId":"22042152","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bioinspired Neural Network for Real-Time Cooperative Hunting by Multirobots in Unknown Environments","sourcePdf":"tnn-yang-pt1-2169808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163385S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6060919","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060921,"authors":[{"name":"Shahab Poshtkouhi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6222041/6060921/6060921-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahab Poshtkouhi (S'10) received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include power electronics for photovoltaic systems, renewable energy, high-frequency/high-efficiency switched-mode power supplies, mixed-signal IC design, and motor drives."]},"firstName":"Shahab","lastName":"Poshtkouhi","id":"37540685700"},{"name":"Vishal Palaniappan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6222041/6060921/6060921-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Vishal Palaniappan is currently working toward the Undergraduate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.","He has been with Prof. Trescases' group since 2009, involved in multiple projects, including PV systems and electric vehicles."]},"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Palaniappan","id":"38247402300"},{"name":"Miad Fard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6222041/6060921/6060921-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Miad Fard is currently working toward the Undergraduate in electrical engineering, with core studies in power and electronics at the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.","He has been an Undergraduate Researcher in Prof. Trescases' group since May 2010, involved in multiple projects such as photovoltaics, and educational development boards.

A general simulation method is developed to quantify the total energy yield for photovoltaic (PV) installation sites exploiting different levels of Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking (DMPPT) granularity. The process includes 3-D modeling, shading evaluation of the installation site, and irradiance calculations on the PV surfaces on an hourly basis throughout the year. Three leading microconverter topologies are analyzed and the cost/performance tradeoff is discussed for panel-level DMPPT. The energy yield evaluation technique is confirmed by means of several miniature PV acquisition units for frequent irradiance and temperature measurements in the installation site. The yearly energy yield benefit is shown to be highly dependent on the relative shading in the three installation sites. It is found that the energy yield benefit easily outweighs the power electronics costs in two of the three installations for panel-level DMPPT. The analysis method can be used by PV installers and system designers for accurate energy yield prediction, as well as power electronics engineers who need to bound the cost of their design based on the net energy benefit of the installed PV system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060921/","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6060921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12805004","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A General Approach for Quantifying the Benefit of Distributed Power Electronics for Fine Grained MPPT in Photovoltaic Applications Using 3-D Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Approach for Quantifying the Benefit of Distributed Power Electronics for Fine Grained MPPT in Photovoltaic Applications Using 3-D Modeling","sourcePdf":"tpel-poshtkouhi-2173353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17218S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6222041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6222041","articleId":"6060921","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6060922,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph W.

The algorithm has two components: 1) a motion protocol to ensure that neighboring robots communicate at least sporadically and 2) a pairwise partitioning rule to update territory ownership when two robots communicate. By studying an appropriate dynamical system on the space of partitions of the graph vertices, we prove that territory ownership converges to a pairwise-optimal partition in finite time. This new equilibrium set represents improved performance over common Lloyd-type algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm is an \"anytime algorithm'' that also scales well for large teams and can be run by on-board computers with limited resources.

Typical indoor positioning systems employ a training/positioning model using Wi-Fi fingerprints. While these approaches have practical results in terms of accuracy and coverage, they require an indoor map, which is typically not available to the average user and involves significant training costs. A practical indoor pedestrian tracking approach should consider the indoor environment without a pretrained database or floor plan. In this paper, we present an indoor pedestrian tracking system, called SmartSLAM, which automatically constructs an indoor floor plan and radio fingerprint map for anonymous buildings using a smartphone. The scheme employs odometry tracing using inertial sensors, an observation model using Wi-Fi signals, and a Bayesian estimation for floor-plan construction. SmartSLAM is a true simultaneous localization and mapping implementation that does not necessitate additional devices, such as laser rangefinders or wheel encoders. We implemented the scheme on off-the-shelf smartphones and evaluated the performance in our university buildings. Despite inherent tracking errors from noisy sensors, SmartSLAM successfully constructed indoor floor plans.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2169403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6330018/06060924.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2169403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6330018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Construction of an Indoor Floor Plan Using a Smartphone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060924/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Construction of an Indoor Floor Plan Using a Smartphone","volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13054894","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6060924/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Construction of an Indoor Floor Plan Using a Smartphone","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-cha-2169403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083639S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6330018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6330018","articleId":"6060924","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6060925,"authors":[{"name":"Aliaksei Sandryhaila","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6060925/6060925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aliaksei Sandryhaila (S'06\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA, in 2010.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, CMU, and a Senior Research Scientist at SpiralGen, Inc.

The proposed algorithm relies on the theory of signal models based on orthogonal polynomials. We demonstrate that the constructed discrete Hermite functions have important ad- vantages compared to continuous Hermite functions, which have previously been suggested for the compression of QRS complexes.

IGRP is based on an effective selection of road intersections through which a packet must pass to reach the gateway to the Internet. The selection is made in a way that guarantees, with high probability, network connectivity among the road intersections while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on tolerable delay, bandwidth usage, and error rate. Geographical forwarding is used to transfer packets between any two intersections on the path, reducing the path's sensitivity to individual node movements. To achieve this, we mathematically formulate the QoS routing problem as a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, analytical expressions for the connectivity probability, end-to-end delay, hop count, and bit error rate (BER) of a route in a two-way road scenario are derived. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approach gives optimal or near-optimal solutions and significantly improves VANET performance when compared with several prominent routing protocols, such as greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR), greedy perimeter coordinator routing (GPCR), and optimized link-state routing (OLSR).","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2173510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06060927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2173510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","startPage":"4560","endPage":"4574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intersection-Based Geographical Routing Protocol for VANETs: A Proposal and Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intersection-Based Geographical Routing Protocol for VANETs: A Proposal and Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408189","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6060927/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intersection-Based Geographical Routing Protocol for VANETs: A Proposal and Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-saleet-2173510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118636S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6060927","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6060929,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Longo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Longo","id":"37410523000"},{"name":"Guido Herrmann","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Herrmann","id":"37284937100"},{"name":"Phil Barber","affiliation":["Jaguar and Land Rover Research, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Phil","lastName":"Barber","id":"37409164400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6060929","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":934},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Robustness","Sampled data systems","Scheduling","Networked control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combinatorial optimization","hybrid systems","${\\cal H}_{\\infty}$-norm","limited communication","networked control systems (NCSs)","sampled-data control","vehicle control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060929","abstract":"In this brief, we consider the robust (in terms of model uncertainty) off-line scheduling problem for networked control systems (NCSs) with time-triggered communication.

Neural networks are first introduced to account for system uncertainties, and an adaptive sliding mode controller is derived by using on-line updating law to estimate the bound of actuator fault such that any information of the fault is not required. To further address actuator saturation problem, a modified fault tolerant control law is then presented to ensure that the resulting control signal will never incur saturation. It is shown that the roll, pitch and yaw angle trajectories can globally asymptotically track the desired attitude in the face of faulty actuator, system uncertainties, external disturbances and even actuator saturation. A simulation example of a flexible spacecraft is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","volume":"20","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6060930/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Fault Tolerant Attitude Tracking Control for Flexible Spacecraft Under Actuator Saturation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Fault Tolerant Attitude Tracking Control for Flexible Spacecraft Under Actuator Saturation","sourcePdf":"tcst-zhang-2169796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075033S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6264111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"6264111","articleId":"6060930","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6060931,"authors":[{"name":"Ehab Ahmed Sobhy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097085/6060931/6060931-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehab Ahmed Sobhy (S'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics and communications engineering from Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Texas A&M University, College Station.","In Summer 2003, he was an Intern with the Microsystems Components and Packaging Department, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium, where he was involved with MESFETS.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6084801/06060942.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","startPage":"809","endPage":"818","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6060942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Security Framework for Wireless Communications in Smart Distribution Grid","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6060942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376621","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Framework for Wireless Communications in Smart Distribution Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2167354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046175S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6084801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6084801","articleId":"6060942","onlineDate":"25 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6060966,"authors":[{"name":"O.

By analyzing existing production systems, we confirm the benefit of data locality and find that data have different popularity and varying correlation of accesses. We propose DARE, a distributed adaptive data replication algorithm that aids the scheduler to achieve better data locality. DARE solves two problems, how many replicas to allocate for each file and where to place them, using probabilistic sampling and a competitive aging algorithm independently at each node. It takes advantage of existing remote data accesses in the system and incurs no extra network usage. Using two mixed workload traces from Face book, we show that DARE improves data locality by more than 7 times with the FIFO scheduler in Hadoop and achieves more than 85% data locality for the FAIR scheduler with delay scheduling. Turnaround time and job slowdown are reduced by 19% and 25\\%, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059523/6061043/06061051.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DARE: Adaptive Data Replication for Efficient Cluster Scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Heuristic algorithms","Distributed databases","Clustering algorithms","Cloud computing","Aging","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","information retrieval","probability","sampling methods","scheduling","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DARE","cluster scheduling","data intensive system","data locality problem","distributed adaptive data replication algorithm","probabilistic sampling","competitive aging algorithm","remote data access","network usage","Facebook","FIFO scheduler","Hadoop","FAIR scheduler","delay scheduling","turnaround time","job slowdown"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","replication","scheduling","locality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"DARE: Adaptive Data Replication for Efficient Cluster Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061051/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330842","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DARE: Adaptive Data Replication for Efficient Cluster Scheduling","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4516a159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069364S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059523","isNumber":"6061043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059523","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6061043","articleId":"6061051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061068,"authors":[{"name":"Tran Ngoc Minh","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Tran Ngoc","lastName":"Minh","id":"37321645800"},{"name":"Lex Wolters","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Lex","lastName":"Wolters","id":"37283455800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1355-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4516-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"6061068","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061068","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Runtime","Parallel processing","Program processors","Measurement","Scheduling","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","parallel processing","scheduling","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven simulation","performance evaluation","workload features","parallel systems","parallel workloads","temporal locality","scheduling algorithms","random workloads","inaccurate scheduling evaluation","simulation-based experiments"]}],"abstract":"Parallel workloads in practice are far from being randomly distributed, instead they are highly repetitive because users tend to run the same applications over and over again. We refer to this phenomenon as temporal locality. In addition, the workloads exhibit a correlation between runtime and parallelism (i.e., number of processors) as is analysed in this paper. According to our best knowledge, there are very few studies on the impacts of these features on the performance of parallel systems. Since these impacts are not well known, researchers often evaluate scheduling algorithms with random workloads, which neglect the phenomenon of temporal locality and the correlation. This can result in an inaccurate scheduling evaluation for parallel systems, because our study shows that these two features can significantly affect scheduling performance. In our simulation-based experiments, an increase of the correlation can quickly degrade the parallel system performance and can change the result of comparing different scheduling policies. With respect to temporal locality, we indicate that this feature does not always seriously affect schedulers of parallel systems. Instead in particular situations, it can help to improve scheduling performance. Furthermore, we also discuss in this paper the necessity of using workloads with these features in scheduling evaluation as well as how to utilize the features to enhance the performance of schedulers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.27","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059523/6061043/06061068.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"92","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Simulation to Evaluate Performance Impact of Workload Features on Parallel Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Simulation to Evaluate Performance Impact of Workload Features on Parallel Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6061068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330859","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Simulation to Evaluate Performance Impact of Workload Features on Parallel Systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4516a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075062S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059523","isNumber":"6061043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059523","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6061043","articleId":"6061068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061084,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Lage Freitas","affiliation":["INSA, INRIA, IRISA, UMR 6074, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Andre Lage","lastName":"Freitas","id":"38022186700"},{"name":"Nikos Parlavantzas","affiliation":["INSA, INRIA, IRISA, UMR 6074, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Parlavantzas","id":"37442942900"},{"name":"Jean-Louis Pazat","affiliation":["INSA, INRIA, IRISA, UMR 6074, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Louis","lastName":"Pazat","id":"37353606500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1532-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061084","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Quality of service","Mathematical model","Equations","Throughput","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource cost reduction","SLA-driven self-management solution","service providers","service-level agreement","SLA violation","configurable control loops","service configuration","resource usage","large-scale distributed infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["service-oriented computing","cloud","grid","QoS","cost","self-adaptation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061084","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth European Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059529/6061076/06061084.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECOWS.2011.23","doi":"10.1109/ECOWS.2011.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061076","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth European Conference on Web Services","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Reduction through SLA-driven Self-Management","abstract":"A main challenge for service providers is managing service-level agreements (SLAs) with their customers while satisfying their business objectives, such as maximizing profits.

A new hybrid memory architecture, where DRAM serves as cache of PCM main memory, has been proposed to leverage PCM's high scalability and DRAM's fast access time. One biggest issue of PCM is the limited number of writes to storage cells. We argue that good cache mechanism will decrease PCM writes dramatically in hybrid memory system. In this paper, we demonstrate that traditional set associative cache is susceptible to malicious attacks, which lead certain PCM cells to wear-out by constant cache flushes. A novel approach called Randomized Address Remapping (RAR) is proposed to hide the mapping details between DRAM and PCM. With this approach, the attacks based on set associative cache do not work, while the efficiency of caching still remains. We present Static Randomized Address Remapping (SRAR) and Dynamic Randomized Address Remapping (DRAR) in this paper. SRAR invalidates set associative cache based attacks by distributing their address accesses to different sets. DRAR uses a region-based approach to change the mapping dynamically, in case that the static mapping relationship is discovered by attacker compromising operating system. Experimental results show that RAR approaches can prevent malicious attacks and improve PCM endurance greatly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving PCM Endurance with Randomized Address Remapping in Hybrid Memory System","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.62","startPage":"503","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061043","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059523/6061043/06061139.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving PCM Endurance with Randomized Address Remapping in Hybrid Memory System","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061139/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330874","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving PCM Endurance with Randomized Address Remapping in Hybrid Memory System","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4516a503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068674S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059523","isNumber":"6061043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059523","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6061043","articleId":"6061139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6061145,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Du","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Du","id":"38022972600"},{"name":"Piotr Luszczek","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Luszczek","id":"37892026800"},{"name":"Jack Dongarra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","University of Manchester, UK","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Dongarra","id":"37270009400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1355-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4516-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"6061145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061145","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Checkpointing","Linear systems","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Mathematical model","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","matrix decomposition","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance dense linear system solver","soft error resilience","high end computing systems","checkpoint-and-restart","HPC systems","error propagation","error awareness","algorithm based fault tolerance","mathematical model","LU factorization","rank-one perturbation","Sherman-Morrison formula","Gaussian elimination","check pointing algorithm","cluster systems","ScaLAPACK","silent data corruption","system failure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.38","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059523/6061043/06061145.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","startPage":"272","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Dense Linear System Solver with Soft Error Resilience","abstract":"As the scale of modern high end computing systems continues to grow rapidly, system failure has become an issue that requires a better solution than the commonly used scheme of checkpoint and restart (C/R). While hard errors have been studied extensively over the years, soft errors are still under-studied especially for modern HPC systems, and in some scientific applications C/R is not applicable for soft error at all due to error propagation and lack of error awareness. In this work, we propose an algorithm based fault tolerance (ABFT) for high performance dense linear system solver with soft error resilience. By adapting a mathematical model that treats soft error during LU factorization as rank-one perturbation, the solution of Ax=b can be recovered with the Sherman-Morrison formula. Our contribution includes extending error model from Gaussian elimination and pair wise pivoting to LU with partial pivoting, and we provide a practical numerical bound for error detection and a scalable check pointing algorithm to protect the left factor that is needed for recovering x from soft error. Experimental results on cluster systems with ScaLAPACK show that the fault tolerance functionality adds little overhead to the linear system solving and scales well on such systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061145/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12330880","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061145/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High Performance Dense Linear System Solver with Soft Error Resilience","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Dense Linear System Solver with Soft Error Resilience","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4516a272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066902S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059523","isNumber":"6061043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059523","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6061043","articleId":"6061145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061149,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899357100"},{"name":"Sreeram Potluri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sreeram","lastName":"Potluri","id":"37902624900"},{"name":"Miao Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37890682300"},{"name":"Ashish Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ashish Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"38022792900"},{"name":"Xiangyong Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyong","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37407724900"},{"name":"Sayantan Sur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sayantan","lastName":"Sur","id":"37281862200"},{"name":"Dhabaleswar K.

However, data movement in and out of GPGPUs remains the biggest hurdle to overall performance and programmer productivity. Real scientific applications utilize multi-dimensional data. Data in higher dimensions may not be contiguous in memory. In order to improve programmer productivity and to enable communication libraries to optimize non-contiguous data communication, the MPI interface provides MPI data types. Currently, state of the art MPI libraries do not provide native data type support for data that resides in GPU memory. The management of non-contiguous GPU data is a source of productivity and performance loss, because GPU application developers have to manually move the data out of and in to GPUs. In this paper, we present our design for enabling high-performance communication support between GPUs for non-contiguous data types. We describe our innovative approach to improve performance by \"offloading\" data type packing and unpacking on to a GPU device, and \"pipelining\" all data transfer stages between two GPUs. Our design is integrated into the popular MVAPICH2 MPI library for InfiniBand, iWARP and RoCE clusters. We perform a detailed evaluation of our design on a GPU cluster with the latest NVIDIA Fermi GPU adapters. The evaluation reveals that the proposed designs can achieve up to 88% latency improvement for vector data type at 4 MB size with micro benchmarks. For Stencil2D application from the SHOC benchmark suite, our design can simplify the data communication in its main loop, reducing the lines of code by 36%. Further, our method can improve the performance of Stencil2D by up to 42% for single precision data set, and 39% for double precision data set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such design, implementation and evaluation of non-contiguous MPI data communication for GPU clusters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Non-contiguous MPI Datatype Communication for GPU Clusters: Design, Implementation and Evaluation with MVAPICH2","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.42","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059523/6061043/06061149.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Non-contiguous MPI Datatype Communication for GPU Clusters: Design, Implementation and Evaluation with MVAPICH2","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061149/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330884","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Non-contiguous MPI Datatype Communication for GPU Clusters: Design, Implementation and Evaluation with MVAPICH2","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4516a308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071705S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059523","isNumber":"6061043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059523","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6061043","articleId":"6061149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061154,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work, we study if GPU-based heterogeneous clusters can benefit client-server applications. Specifically, we consider the practical situation where multiple client-server applications share a heterogeneous cluster (multi-tenancy), and experience unpredictable variations in incoming client request rates, including steep load spikes. Even for \"compute-intensive\" client-server applications, it is unclear if a GPU-based cluster can seamlessly deliver acceptable response times in the presence of multi-tenancy and load spikes. We argue that a cluster-level scheduler that is aware of application load, request deadlines and the heterogeneity is necessary in this situation. We propose a novel scheduler called Symphony that enables efficient, dynamic sharing of a GPU-based heterogeneous cluster across multiple concurrently-executing client-server applications, each with arbitrary load spikes. Symphony performs three key tasks: it (i) monitors the load on each application, (ii) collects past performance data and dynamically builds simple performance models of available processing resources and (iii) computes a priority for pending requests based on the above parameters and the requests' slack. Based on this, it reorders client requests across different applications to achieve acceptable response times. We also define how client-server applications should interact with a scheduler such as Symphony, and develop an API to this end. We deploy Symphony as user-space middleware on a high-end heterogeneous cluster with dual quad-core Xeon CPUs and dual NVIDIA Fermi GPUs. An evaluation using representative applications shows that in the presence of load spikes (i) Symphony incurs 2-20\u00d7 fewer requests that do not meet response time constraints compared with other schedulers, and (ii) in order to achieve the same performance as Symphony, other schedulers need 2\u00d7 more cluster nodes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.46","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.46","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster

In order to map the Apriori algorithm onto the SIMD execution model, we have designed a \"static bitset\" memory structure to represent the input database. This data structure improves upon the traditional approach of the vertical data layout in state-of-the art Apriori implementations.

In face book-style online social networks every member is potentially able to communicate with everyone else within the network. This has an important impact on centrality: the power derivable from (exclusive) connections within the social graph is reduced because network members must not necessarily follow links. In this paper we propose a new measure for centrality which reflects this paradigm shift. It is based not on connectedness but on trust. We discuss different notions of trust, introduce trust matrix and trust centrality and provide an algorithm for its calculation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059524/6061109/06061233.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"2011 European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference","doi":"10.1109/EISIC.2011.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EISIC.2011.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust Centrality in Online Social Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Privacy","Symmetric matrices","Tin","DH-HEMTs","Facebook"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","matrix algebra","security of data","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust centrality","social network analysis","social graph","trust matrix","facebook-style online social networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["trust","reputation","social network analysis","centrality","online social network","trust centrality","trust matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Trust Centrality in Online Social Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061233/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330957","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust Centrality in Online Social Networks","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"4406a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041818S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059524","isNumber":"6061109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059524","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6061109","articleId":"6061233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6061276,"authors":[{"name":"Guosun Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guosun","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37276697000"},{"name":"Lihua Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Yu","id":"38022408200"},{"name":"Chunling Ding","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chunling","lastName":"Ding","id":"38030795900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061276","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time optimization","energy optimization","computing environment","parallel task","parallel processing system","high performance computing","green computing","scheduling problem","heterogeneous computing speed matrix","heterogeneous computing power matrix","heuristic executing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneous computi","task executin","time optimization","energy optimization"]}],"abstract":"Both the heterogeneity of the computing environment and the complexity of various application tasks lead to heterogeneous computing. The purpose of heterogeneous computing is to obtain the best executing effect for a parallel task running on the parallel processing system by putting emphasis on the difference between the parallel task and system, and exploring the optimal matching between the task and system. Currently, in heterogeneous computing, the scheduling method only for time optimization is quite mature, but the research on the executing method both for time and energy optimization is very few. This paper aims at the high performance computing and green computing, and pays more attention to the scheduling problem for a parallel task in heterogeneous computing environment. We present the heterogeneous task model, the heterogeneous computing speed matrix and the heterogeneous computing power matrix. Based on the idea that energy can be unified to time, this paper proposes some heuristic executing algorithms to achieve both time and energy optimization for a parallel task on heterogeneous system.

Due to the openness in network topology and the absence of centralized administration in management, MANET is vulnerable to attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from these malicious nodes, we incorporate the concept of trust into the MANET, and build a subjective trust management model with multiple decision factors based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) theory and the fuzzy logic rules prediction method - AFStrust. We consider multiple decision factors, including direct trust, recommendation trust, incentive function and active degree, in our model to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty from various aspects. It overcomes the shortage of traditional method, where the decision factors are incomplete. Moreover, the weight of classification is set up by AHP for these decision factors, which makes the model has a better rationality and a higher practicability. Compared to the existing trust management models, comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our trust management model in the improvement of network interaction

rapid development of internet applications, more and more network service and commercial applications are deployed to cloud computing environment, with petabytes of data to be processed. MapReduce is one of the most famous solutions for large-scale data processing. This paper focuses on optimizing the scheduler of MapReduce framework in task level. We care about the hardware configuration and real-time workload of the nodes in a hadoop cluster and aim at shortening time cost of MapReduce jobs and improving hardware resource utilization rate. We put forward a load-driven task scheduler which assigns tasks to Task Trackers according to the workload of slave nodes. It is based on a Dynamic Slot Controller (DSC) that can adjust Map task Slot (MS) and Reduce task Slot (RS) of Task Trackers running on slave nodes adaptively. Our load-driven task scheduler can shorten time consumption of MapReduce job by 14% and improve the CPU utilization rate of hadoop cluster by 34% when processing 10GB data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Load-Driven Task Scheduler with Adaptive DSC for MapReduce","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2011.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059527/6061274/06061314.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2011.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Load-Driven Task Scheduler with Adaptive DSC for MapReduce","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061314/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Load-Driven Task Scheduler with Adaptive DSC for MapReduce","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"4466a028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075703S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059527","isNumber":"6061274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059527","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6061274","articleId":"6061314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6061325,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wen","id":"38004353400"},{"name":"Xingsheng Tang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Xingsheng","lastName":"Tang","id":"38025440800"},{"name":"Lihan Ju","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Lihan","lastName":"Ju","id":"37845095600"},{"name":"Tianzhou Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061325","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"abstract":"Regular expression is an important approach which is widely used in string pattern matching. And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably. Analyzed by XPower, which offered by Xilinx Inc., our approach is able to save dynamic power consumption by1.7 times comparing to traditional approaches on Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059527/6061274/06061325.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2011.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom.2011.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PeRex: A Power Efficient FPGA-based Architecture for Regular Expression Matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Pattern matching","Hardware","Computer architecture","Radiation detectors","Random access memory","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","string matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PeRex","power efficient FPGA-based architecture","power efficient regular expression matching architecture","string pattern matching","dynamic power consumption","XPower","Xilinx Inc","Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["regular expression matching","NFA","power efficient accelerator","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"PeRex: A Power Efficient FPGA-based Architecture for Regular Expression Matching","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331097","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PeRex: A Power Efficient FPGA-based Architecture for Regular Expression Matching","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"4466a188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074653S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059527","isNumber":"6061274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059527","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6061274","articleId":"6061325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061358,"authors":[{"name":"Fausto Giunchiglia","affiliation":["DISI, University of Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Fausto","lastName":"Giunchiglia","id":"37394424200"},{"name":"Bruno Crispo","affiliation":["DISI, University of Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Crispo","id":"37298658000"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["CCST, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652300200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1648-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4492-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061358","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"The paper presents Relation Based Access Control RelBAC, a model and a logic for access control which models communities, possibly nested, and resources, possibly organized inside complex file systems, as lightweight ontologies, and permissions as relations between subjects and objects.

One drawback of QBE is that a user can only provide a small number of example shots, while each shot is generally represented by a high-dimensional feature. This causes that the retrieval model tends to be over fit to feature dimensions which are specific to example shots, but are ineffective for retrieving relevant shots. As a result, many clearly irrelevant shots are retrieved. To overcome this, we construct a {\\it video ontology} as knowledge base for QBE. Our video ontology is used to select concepts related to a query. Then, irrelevant shots are filtered by referring to recognition results of objects corresponding to selected concepts. Also, counter-example shots are not provided in QBE, although they are useful for constructing an accurate retrieval model. We introduce a method which selects counter-example shots among shots without user supervision. In this method, our video ontology is used to exclude shots relevant to the query from candidates of counter-example shots. Specifically, we filter shots where object recognition results for concepts related to the query are similar to those of example shots. The effectiveness of our video ontology is tested on TRECVID 2009 video data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Windows","Vehicles","Object

Optimization","abstract":"Organ labeling involves estimating approximate organ locations from medical images and has several traditional and emerging applications. The organ labels can serve as initialization for automatic and fast image processing, provide additional information for image data mining and retrieval, and assist fast image navigation and workflow on radiology workstations. The problem is made difficult by variability in anatomy, imaging modalities, scanning protocols, and pathology. This paper presents a new model-based framework to localizing multiple organs in the body from images produced by different scanning modalities. The model has two components: a modality-independent geometric model and a modality-specific (CT, MR) appearance model. The geometric representation encodes anatomical knowledge as the distribution of individual and relative locations of organs. The appearance models for each organ are created from their intensity profiles in the respective modality. The multi-organ labeling problem is then formulated as a global optimization problem solved using dynamic programming without requiring initialization. Initial results of applying the framework to CT and MR volumes were encouraging and demonstrated the strength of using organ-level anatomical information with simple geometric models and image-level feature sets for the task of organ labeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6061463/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12340722","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Organ Labeling Using Anatomical Model-Driven Global Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Organ Labeling Using Anatomical Model-Driven Global Optimization","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4407a338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070894S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059713","isNumber":"6061379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6061379","articleId":"6061463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6061554,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Xuelian","affiliation":["School of Marine Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xuelian","id":"38017149500"},{"name":"Yang Yixin","affiliation":["School of Marine Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yixin","id":"38019711200"},{"name":"Shi Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Yang","id":"38025037700"},{"name":"Wang Xiaoyu","affiliation":["School of Marine Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xiaoyu","id":"37391692900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061554","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Wideband","Array signal processing","Direction of arrival estimation","Parallel processing","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","digital signal processing chips","direction-of-arrival estimation","sonar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum variance distortionless response","wideband MVDR beamforming","multi-DSP parallel system","sonar system","ADSP-TS201","incoherent signal subspace processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","wideband incoherent acoustic sources","memory allocation","complex matrix inversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-DSP parallel system","ADSP-TS201","wideband MVDR beamforming","DOA estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a multi-DSP parallel system based on ADSP-TS201 is designed, and a method of wideband minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming implemented on the parallel system is presented, which is based on incoherent signal subspace processing, to solve the problem of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for wideband incoherent acoustic sources.

Channel frequency response can be estimated by pilots that are already known to the receiver. Bit error rate (BER) performance can vary a lot according to different type of pilot pattern. Three kinds of pilot (Block, Comb and Scatter) are analyzed and each of them is proved to work well in some certain underwater environment. Underwater channel is demonstrated to be a comb filter. With channel estimation, stopband and passband of the experiment channel are found and analyzed. Channel estimation error is more likely to occur in stopband than in passband, especially when the channel coherence bandwidth is small. Interchannel interference (ICI) can cause large estimation error by increase its noise level. An improved transform domain filter can reduce the estimation SNR significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061598.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater acoustic channel estimation for pilot based OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Doppler effect","Underwater acoustics","Receivers","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic channel estimation","pilot based OFDM","frequency-selective characters","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel frequency response","bit error rate performance","BER performance","Interchannel interference","ICI","SNR","transform domain filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","underwater communication","channel estimation","transform domain signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic channel estimation for pilot based OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061598/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330458","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic channel estimation for pilot based OFDM","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088575S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6061600,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yougan","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yougan","id":"37680921800"},{"name":"Xu Xiaomei","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Xiaomei","id":"37298562900"},{"name":"Zhang Lan","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Lan","id":"37681366600"},{"name":"Feng Wei","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37979854600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061600","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Channel coding","Channel models","Delay effects","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","channel coding","cyclic codes","parity check codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application analysis","QC-LDPC codes","shallow water acoustic channels","wireless digital communications","low complexity channel coding scheme","system simulation model","belief propagation","girth","circulant permutation matrix size","decoding iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","quasi-cyclic","shallow water acoustic channel","underwater acoustic communications"]}],"abstract":"The shallow water acoustic (SWA) channel is one of the most challenging channels in wireless digital communications.

With the decoding algorithm of belief propagation (BP), the effects of QC-LDPC codes design parameters, such as girth, circulant permutation matrix size and decoding iterations are discussed. To verify the proposed approach, Quangang Xiaocuo harbor blasting data are used to set up a SWA channel model, and the performances of QC-LDPC codes over the channel model are analyzed.

However, the problem with the robust FIB design is that the performance will degrade when the design bandwidth is increasing. To combat this problem, a robust FIB design approach using the variably-weighted constrained least squares is proposed in this paper.

The performance of the two proposed algorithms are finally demonstrated by the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061634","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming design for multi-pair two-way AF MIMO relaying networks using quadratic programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061634/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming design for multi-pair two-way AF MIMO relaying networks using quadratic programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330493","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061634/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming design for multi-pair two-way AF MIMO relaying networks using quadratic programming","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080253S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061637,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrez Souden","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Group, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Mehrez","lastName":"Souden","id":"37294213100"},{"name":"Shoko Araki","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Group, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoko","lastName":"Araki","id":"37274774900"},{"name":"Keisuke Kinoshita","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Group, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37420926300"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Group, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Sawada","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Group, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Sawada","id":"37274767900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061637","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Microphones","Microwave integrated circuits","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","blind source separation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous speech source separation","clustering","MMSE-based filtering","blind source separation","acoustic noise reduction","posterior probabilities","expectation maximization algorithm","noise statistics","speech source statistics","multichannel minimum-mean-square-error-based filter","additive noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone arrays","blind source separation","multichannel Wiener filter","noise reduction"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous speech source separation and noise reduction via clustering and MMSE-based filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061637","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061637","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","abstract":"We propose a new multichannel approach for simultaneous blind source separation (BSS) and acoustic noise reduction.

This stereophonic sound allows the listener to determine the position of the speaker simply by listening to the sound. Optimized stereophonic sound generating methods are embedded in the system, resulting in a small-sized design. The system can easily replace the currently popular communication systems that use the mono sound sources such as walkie-talkies or citizens' band transceivers.

With Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP), a new fitness function of particle swarm is constructed which makes the particle avoid obstacles in the initialization and update process. For solving the calculated inflation problems of PSO algorithm, the resultant force direction is applied in the particles renewal process as gradient information. In this case, the particles learn the direction of the resultant force with personal best solution and global best solution to update their position and speed, as a result, the movement of particle will be more efficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Trajectory","Radar tracking","Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","probability","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["APF-PSO","radar threats","trajectory optimization problem","multiobserver system","artificial potential field theory","particle swarm optimization","detection probability","geometrical dilution of precision","GDOP","gradient information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["observer trajectory optimization","radar threats","artificial potential field","particle swarm optimization","fitness function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061673","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of trajectories based on APF-PSO with radar threats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of trajectories based on APF-PSO with radar threats","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061673/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061673/","accessionNumber":"12330532","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of trajectories based on APF-PSO with radar threats","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04526S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6061681,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ching Yun University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Chu","id":"37349864700"},{"name":"Wei-Yau Horng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ching Yun University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Yau","lastName":"Horng","id":"38017469300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061681","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Covariance matrix","Loading","Multiaccess communication","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","covariance matrices","optimisation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust CDMA receiver","signature vector estimation","interference covariance matrix","code division multiple access receiver","signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio","SINR","optimization problem","pseudointerference techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA system","robust multiuser detection","subspace methods","interference suppression","pseudo-interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel framework based on a subspace technique and a pseudo-interference technique to estimate the signature vector and the interference covariance matrix for the code division multiple access (CDMA) receiver to provide robustness against the signature vector mismatch.

This paper presents a novel strategy to configure femtocell users' power and bandwidth jointly and an algorithm to estimate the connection QoS requirement. The strategy can effectively reduce the cross-tier interference while ensuring high spectrum efficiency.

However, since the targets are usually moving slowly and the spectrum lines of underwater target radiated noise are usually in the low frequency range, the Doppler shift is very tiny. We propose a Short-Time Chirp Fourier Transform method to estimate tiny Doppler shift using a longer time window to solve this problem. For estimation of Doppler parameters, two time-frequency curves are constructed by different time windows of Short-Time Chirp Transform. The intersection point of these two curves can be used to estimate the time of zeros Doppler and Doppler centre frequency exactly. The estimation errors of the proposed method are always less than the steplength of slipping window. Therefore the error of estimation can be controlled within the desired range. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061700","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061700.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler parameters estimation by Short Time Chirp Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061700/","displayDocTitle":"Doppler parameters estimation by Short Time Chirp Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330559","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061700/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler parameters estimation by Short Time Chirp Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078752S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6061701,"authors":[{"name":"Lai Lei","affiliation":["School of Automatic Control, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Lai","lastName":"Lei","id":"38020724400"},{"name":"Qu ShiRu","affiliation":["School of Automatic Control, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Qu","lastName":"ShiRu","id":"38017288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061701","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Filtering theory","Filtering algorithms","Gabor filters","Image reconstruction","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","decomposition","entropy","Gabor filters","infrared detectors","object detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infrared small weak target detection","optimized nonsubsampled contourlet transform","image pixel","marking feature","image decomposition","low frequency coefficients","high frequency coefficients","adaptive mean filter","Gabor wavelet","background information","region entropy","false target alarms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["infrared weak small target","contourlet transform","object detection","background suppression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061701","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach of infrared small weak target detection based on an improved nonsubsampled contourlet transform","abstract":"Infrared small weak target is difficult to detect since it often take up one or two pixel(s) in image.

This paper presents a novel image quality assessment model. The model is designed to reduce the influence which is caused by the degradation of facial image quality due to uncontrolled variations of facial appearances, and the degradation can lower the recognition performance. The model assesses the image quality from several aspects: (I) Occlusion measure. (II) Face-to-camera distance measure. (Ill) Pose and expression measure.(IV) Uneven illumination measure. Then noisy score is calculated by the image quality assessment model while higher noisy score's images will be discarded for face recognition, the superior face images are selected by image quality assessment model to obtain best recognition result. Experimental results on CAS-PEAL face databases with varied uncontrolled facial appearances demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved satisfactory recognition rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image quality assessment model based on features and applications in face recognition","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061709","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061709.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Image quality assessment model based on features and applications in face recognition","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061709/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330568","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image quality assessment model based on features and applications in face recognition","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058315S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6061713,"authors":[{"name":"Tang Jiansheng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, Systems Engineering Research Institute of CSSC, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Jiansheng","id":"37567905800"},{"name":"Pan Yue","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, Systems Engineering Research Institute of CSSC, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Yue","id":"37288514300"},{"name":"Jiang Xiangdong","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, Systems Engineering Research Institute of CSSC, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xiangdong","id":"38031025600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061713","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061713","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Arrays","Sonar","Covariance matrix","Marine vehicles","Array signal processing","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Global Positioning System","interference suppression","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post beamformer weak signal extraction","strong interference","signal direction","cooperative ship","GPS","automated identification system","adjacent region","beamspace MVDR","beamspace interference signal","post beamformer interference canceller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["postbeamformer weak signal extraction","strong interference","beamspace MVDR","post-beamformer interference canceller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061713","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061713.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Postbeamformer weak signal extraction with a strong interference colse to the signal's direction","abstract":"In the paper, we consider the problem of extracting the weak signal in the presence of a strong interference which is close to the signal's direction. In our concerned situation, the strong interference is often caused by a cooperative ship, and its direction can be accurately obtained by GPS or Automated Identification System (AIS). A post-beamformer process procedure is proposed to deal with the problem. Beams are densely formed in the adjacent region of the strong interference's direction. These beam outputs are processed by the beamspace MVDR using the ideal beamspace interference signal model and the post-beamformer interference canceller (PIC) using the beam output in the exact interference's direction to extract the weak signal information. Some computer simulations were used to analyze the performance of the two methods using the proposed processing procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061713/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12330572","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061713/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Postbeamformer weak signal extraction with a strong interference colse to the signal's direction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Postbeamformer weak signal extraction with a strong interference colse to the signal's direction","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04863S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6061715,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Lin","affiliation":["T\u00e9SA Laboratory, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37714586300"},{"name":"Aneline Grand","affiliation":["3GP/3GM/PSA Audio Algorithms, ST-Ericsson, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Aneline","lastName":"Grand","id":"38027406100"},{"name":"St\u00e9phan Tassart","affiliation":["3GP/3GM/PSA Audio Algorithms, ST-Ericsson, Paris, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phan","lastName":"Tassart","id":"37846388500"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Tourneret","affiliation":["T\u00e9SA Laboratory, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Tourneret","id":"37285150700"},{"name":"Olivier Besson","affiliation":["T\u00e9SA Laboratory, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Besson","id":"37274638700"},{"name":"Laurent Sa\u00efd","affiliation":["3GP/3GM/PSA Audio Algorithms, ST-Ericsson, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Sa\u00efd","id":"38024359400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061715","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Azimuth","Array signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Wideband","Microphones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microphone arrays","sensor fusion","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized spatial resampling","microphone array beamforming","generic processing","irregular 3D sensor arrays","beam pattern analysis","uniform linear array","multisensor audio processing methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array","spatial resampling","beamforming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized spatial resampling for microphone array beamforming","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061715","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061715","abstract":"Due to the specialty of portable devices, the microphone array configurations usually depend on the device manufacturing constraints, and thus are various and generally irregular.

Most of the existing algorithms for symbol timing synchronization cost a huge number of operations on cross-correlation or energy computing, so that, a great amount of multipliers and logic resources would be consumed if these algorithms are implemented on FPGA. The scheme proposed and implemented in this paper firstly locates the strongest muti-path by sign cross-correlation which has a low implementation complexity, and then finds the start of FFT window by utilizing an existing cross-correlation based algorithm inside a boundary, this boundary can be confirmed by the location of the strongest muti-path. The module for symbol timing synchronization has been designed in Quartus II, and the functional simulation result obtained shows correctness of the module.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061742.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of symbol timing synchronization for MB-OFDM UWB systems on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","OFDM","Correlation","Correlators","Field programmable gate arrays","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol timing synchronization cost","MB-OFDM UWB systems","FPGA","low hardware consumption","logic resources","sign cross-correlation","FFT","Quartus II","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultrawideband communication","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","MB-OFDM","timing synchronization","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of symbol timing synchronization for MB-OFDM UWB systems on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330599","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of symbol timing synchronization for MB-OFDM UWB systems on FPGA","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045848S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6061756,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Fan","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Fan","id":"38026460300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061756","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1729},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data acquisition","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Operational amplifiers","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data acquisition","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","data acquisition system","physical signal acquisition","analog signal to digital signal conversion","front-end signal processing module","data storage module","VHDL","ISE software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data acquisition system","FPGA","Signal conversion","Data storage","VHDL","Sensor"]}],"abstract":"This paper is for the purpose of designing a FPGA-based data acquisition system, utilizing the high processing speed feature of FPGA.

The proposed channel estimator consists of two stages. In the first stage, channel prediction from the previous block to the current block is carried out to generate artificial measurements on OFDM subcarriers. One key innovation is to allow different clusters of channel paths to vary differently across the blocks, where the delay, amplitude and phase variations of the clusters are determined based on the channel estimate of the previous block and the measurements on pilot subcarriers of the current block. In the second stage, a sparse channel estimation is performed based on both the artificially generated measurements and the real measurements of the current block, accounting for their different reliabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimator considerably outperforms the conventional channel estimator without cluster-based adaptation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061775.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061775","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061775","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Receivers","Delay","Current measurement","Indexes","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["per-cluster-prediction based sparse channel estimation","multicarrier underwater acoustic communications","zero-padded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","clustered sparse underwater acoustic channels","channel prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustic channels","OFDM","clustered channel","sparse channel estimation","compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061775/","displayDocTitle":"Per-cluster-prediction based sparse channel estimation for multicarrier underwater acoustic communications","accessionNumber":"12330630","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6061775/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-cluster-prediction based sparse channel estimation for multicarrier underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.166153S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6061778,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Jinhui","affiliation":["National laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Jinhui","id":"38030724000"},{"name":"Liao Guisheng","affiliation":["National laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liao","lastName":"Guisheng","id":"37270712300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061778","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Doppler effect","Azimuth","Mathematical model","Equations","Sonar navigation","Airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","radar signal processing","signal sampling","space-time adaptive processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse sampling based compensation method","FLAR","complex amplitude","clutter scatterer","sampling threshold","Doppler curve","forward looking airborne radar","space time adaptive processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse Sampling","Forward-Looking Airborne Radar","Space-time adaptive processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061778","abstract":"A sparse sampling based compensation (SSBC) method is proposed in this letter.

Although some learning algorithms including bagging and boosting have been developed to create such weak learners, learners trained by these learning algorithms are actually not so weak in many applications. This paper presents a simple balanced ensemble learning method for producing weak learners. The idea of balanced ensemble learning is to change the learning force in the training process so that the training data points near to the decision boundaries would push the decision boundaries further while the training data points far away from the decision boundaries would drag the decision boundaries to themselves. The experimental results suggest that balanced ensemble learning is able to create learners being both weak and negatively correlated.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061781","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046214/6061546/06061781.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2011.6061781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Create weak learners with small neural networks by balanced ensemble learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Training data","Correlation","Error analysis","Bagging","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","weak learners","majority voting model","learning algorithms","bagging algorithms","boosting algorithms","balanced ensemble learning method","training process","decision boundary","training data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Create weak learners with small neural networks by balanced ensemble learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12330636","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Create weak learners with small neural networks by balanced ensemble learning","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046674S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046214","isNumber":"6061546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6046214","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6061546","articleId":"6061781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6061784,"authors":[{"name":"Fufei Gu","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, AFEU, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Fufei","lastName":"Gu","id":"38015278100"},{"name":"Long Chi","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, AFEU, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Chi","id":"37603845800"},{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, AFEU, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275877700"},{"name":"Feng Zhu","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, AFEU, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37292059600"},{"name":"Ying Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, AFEU, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liang","id":"38022161500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0894-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0893-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061784","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":532},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Radar imaging","Antenna arrays","Imaging","MIMO radar","Radar antennas","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO radar","radar imaging","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imaging method","MIMO radar","sparse array","antenna elements","sparse antenna array","compressed sensing theory","motion compensation","single snapshot imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","Sparse array","Compressed Sensing","Single snapshot imaging"]}],"abstract":"The number of antenna elements in MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) radar is too many when imaging for moving targets with single snapshot.

A 65 nm CMOS Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology has been selected as target. With respect to the state of the art, the on-chip co-design of LNA and antenna permits avoiding a pre-defined constraint of 50 Ohm impedance matching. By relaxing the impedance matching specification a LNA with only two amplification stages has been designed to reach the desired power gain (>;20 dB) and noise figure (<; 5 dB) with a power consumption and circuit complexity optimized vs. state-of-art LNAs with similar performances. A dipole antenna with coplanar strip feed has been also designed matching the 20 Ohm input LNA impedance and allowing an extra gain of 3 dB at 60 GHz with a limited on-chip area occupation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology","Wireless communication","Gain","System-on-a-chip","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","coplanar waveguides","impedance matching","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave antennas","radiocommunication","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifier","integrated antenna","wireless communications","LNA","CMOS silicon-on-insulator technology","SOI technology","impedance matching","power consumption","circuit complexity","coplanar strip feed","frequency 60 GHz","size 65 nm","resistance 50 ohm","gain 3 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LNA (low-noise amplifier)","60-GHz","CMOS Silicon On Insulator (SOI)","On-chip antenna","Wireless Gbits/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMWS3.2011.6061864","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Millimeter Wave Integration Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Millimeter Wave Integration Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056503/6061843/06061864.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS3.2011.6061864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Low Noise Amplifier with integrated antenna for 60 GHz wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Low Noise Amplifier with integrated antenna for 60 GHz wireless communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061864/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061864/","accessionNumber":"12330801","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Low Noise Amplifier with integrated antenna for 60 GHz wireless communications","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"p160fonte.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075948S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056503","isNumber":"6061843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056503","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6061843","articleId":"6061864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6061890,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Hamidian","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Hamidian","id":"37395674300"},{"name":"Viswanathan Subramanian","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37400271800"},{"name":"Georg Boeck","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Boeck","id":"37282337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-965-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-963-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-964-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6061890","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":398},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Power amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Impedance matching","Transistors","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","heterojunction bipolar transistors","millimetre wave bipolar transistors","millimetre wave power amplifiers","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband mm-wave power amplifier design","full EM simulation","full electromagnetic simulation","two-stage power amplifier","cascode topology","flat gain response","V-band","peak power added efficiency","HBT","frequency 200 GHz","size 0.25 mum","gain 3 dB","frequency 50 GHz to 70 GHz","gain 20 dB","gain 1 dB","efficiency 15 percent","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","SiGe-HBT","Power amplifier","Electro-Magnetic simulation","Broad-band gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061890","abstract":"This work presents the design of two broad-band mm-wave power amplifiers utilizing the 200 GHz 0.25 \u03bcm SiGe HBTs.

CPSs can use the information available from the physical environment to provide such ubiquitous, energy-efficient and low-cost functionalities. Their operation needs to ensure three key properties, collectively referred to as S3: 1) safety: avoidance of hazards; 2) security: assurance of integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information; and 3) sustainability: maintenance of long-term operation of CPSs using green sources of energy. Ensuring S3 properties in a CPS is a challenging task given the spatio-temporal dynamics of the underlying physical environment. In this paper, the formal underpinnings of recent CPS S3 solutions are aligned together in a theoretical framework for cyber-physical interactions, empowering CPS researchers to systematically design solutions for ensuring safety, security, or sustainability. The general applicability of this framework is demonstrated with various exemplar solutions for S3 in diverse CPS domains. Further, insights are provided on some of the open research problems for ensuring S3 in CPSs.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2165689","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6106039/06061910.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2165689","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"283","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Mission-Critical Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061910","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Mission-Critical Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061910/","volume":"100","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6061910/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425481","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Mission-Critical Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-banerjee-2165689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113869S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6106039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"6106039","articleId":"6061910","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":6061915,"authors":[{"name":"Reid Riedlinger","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6109882/6061915/6061915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reid Riedlinger received the M.S.E.E. degree from Montana State University in 1993.","He then joined Hewlett Packard and worked on various PA-RISC and IPF processors.

The CNN is defined by a one-dimensional cell-linking (irreducible) cloning template with nearest-neighbor interconnections and has periodic boundary conditions. The flow generated by the SCNN is monotone but, due to the squashing effect of the horizontal segments in the PL activations, is not eventually strongly monotone (ESM). A new method for addressing convergence of the cooperative SCNN array is developed, which is based on the two main tools: (1) the concept of a frozen saddle, i.e., an unstable saddle-type equilibrium point (EP) enjoying certain dynamical properties that hold also for an asymptotically stable EP (a sink); (2) the analysis of the order relations satisfied by the sinks and saddle-type EPs. The analysis permits to show a fundamental result according to which any pair of ordered EPs of the SCNN contains at least a sink or a frozen saddle. On this basis it is shown that the flow generated by the SCNN enjoys a LIMIT SET DICHOTOMY and convergence properties analogous to those valid for ESM flows. Such results hold in the case where the SCNN displays either a local diffusion or a global propagation behavior.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169913","startPage":"772","endPage":"783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6174505/06061917.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6174505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence of a Class of Cooperative Standard Cellular Neural Network Arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Convergence","Vectors","Integrated circuit interconnections","Cellular neural networks","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","cellular neural nets","convergence","cooperative systems","piecewise linear techniques","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative standard cellular neural network arrays","nonsymmetric standard cellular neural network array","cooperative interconnections","three-segment piecewise-linear neuron activation","one-dimensional cell-linking cloning template","nearest-neighbor interconnections","periodic boundary conditions","squashing effect","eventually strongly monotone","cooperative SCNN array","unstable saddle-type equilibrium point","dynamical properties","limit set dichotomy","convergence properties","asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence","cooperative dynamical systems","limit set dichotomy","standard cellular neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of a Class of Cooperative Standard Cellular Neural Network Arrays","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of a Class of Cooperative Standard Cellular Neural Network Arrays","sourcePdf":"tcsi-forti-2169913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091416S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6174505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","articleId":"6061917","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6061920,"authors":[{"name":"Hae-Chang Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097085/6061920/6061920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hae-Chang Jeong was born in Cheonan, Korea, in 1984.

It is shown that the FOS control gain for a three-time-scale system can be obtained by combining the solutions of the three subsystem problems, obtained separately. Since three smaller order subsystem problems are to be solved in lieu of one high order problem, numerical ill-conditioning is completely avoided. Techniques for block-diagonalization and composite control of a three-time-scale system are also discussed. The proposed method is applied to the problem of spatial control of advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR). The model of AHWR is decomposed into three subsystems respectively named \u201cslow,\u201d \u201cfast 1,\u201d and \u201cfast 2,\u201d and separate subsystem control problems are cast from which an FOS controller for the original system is derived. Efficacy of the controller thus obtained is demonstrated through dynamic simulations.

A key component of the design is the use of a statistics-based positioning (SBP) method for 3D event positioning. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expresses limits on the estimate variances for a set of deterministic parameters. We examine the CRLB as a useful metric to evaluate the performance of our SBP algorithm and to quickly compare the best possible resolution when investigating new detector designs. In this work, the CRLB is first reported based upon experimental results from a cMiCE detector using a 50X50X15-mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n LYSO crystal readout by a 64-channel PMT (Hamamatsu H8500) on the exit surface of the crystal. The X/Y resolution is relatively close to the CRLB, while the DOI resolution is more than double the CRLB even after correcting for beam diameter and finite X (i.e., reference DOI position) resolution of the detector. The positioning performance of the cMiCE detector with the same design was also evaluated through simulation. Similar with the experimental results, the difference between the CRLB and measured spatial resolution is bigger in DOI direction than in X/Y direction. Another simulation study was conducted to investigate what causes the difference between the measured spatial resolution and the CRLB. The cMiCE detector with novel sensor-on-entrance-surface (SES) design was modeled as a 49.2X49.2X15 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n LYSO crystal readout by a 12X12 array of 3.8X3.8-mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) elements with 4.1-mm center-to-center spacing on the entrance surface of the crystal. The results show that there are two main causes to account for the differences between the spatial resolution and the CRLB. First, Compton scatter in the crystal degrades the spatial resolution. The DOI resolution is degraded more than the X/Y resolution since small angle scatter is preferred. Second, our maximum likelihood (ML) clustering algorithm also has limitations when developing 3D look up tables during detector calibration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12525092","pubMedId":"22685349","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6061926/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Use of Cramer\u2013Rao Lower Bound for Performance Evaluation of Different Monolithic Crystal PET Detector Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Cramer\u2013Rao Lower Bound for Performance Evaluation of Different Monolithic Crystal PET Detector Designs","sourcePdf":"tns-li-2165968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075074S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6146807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6146807","articleId":"6061926","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6061935,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Azize","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Azize","id":"37319489200"},{"name":"Allen L.

The unitary matrices can be either eigenbases or steering matrices in different domains. The coupling tensor reflects the relationship between the column vectors of these unitary matrices. The complex Gaussian tensor is used to describe the small-scale fading. Several realizations of this framework are introduced, including the wideband Kronecker-based (WKB) model, the wideband eigenvalue-decomposition-based (WEB) model, the wideband virtual presentation (WVP) model and the wideband hybrid (WHY) model. To evaluate the performance of these models, channel measurements were carried out in different indoor scenarios both at Tsinghua University and Lund University. The results show that these models have good agreement with the measured data. Furthermore, we can see that the WHY model can provide a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy in channel synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2173436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6142627/06061945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2173436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142627","startPage":"574","endPage":"586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Coupling-Based Model Framework for Wideband MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Coupling-Based Model Framework for Wideband MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509020","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6061945/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Coupling-Based Model Framework for Wideband MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2173436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099011S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6142627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6142627","articleId":"6061945","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6061947,"authors":[{"name":"David T.

The performance has been tested using PSCAD/EMTDC program. The plant layout used in the simulations is based on an installed wind power plant, composed of 23 doubly fed generator wind turbines. The resulting performance is evaluated using a compilation of grid code voltage control requirements. The results show that fast response to grid disturbances can be achieved using the secondary voltage control scheme, and the fulfillment of the design requirements can be extended for a wide range of short-circuit ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061949/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537561","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6061949/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of a Slope Voltage Control for a DFIG Wind Power Plant","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of a Slope Voltage Control for a DFIG Wind Power Plant","sourcePdf":"tec-garcia-2170197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083536S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6152302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6152302","articleId":"6061949","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6061951,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoshun Li","affiliation":["School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6176019/6061951/6061951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chaoshun Li received the B.S. degree in thermal energy and power engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in water conservancy and hydropower engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, in 2010.","He is currently a Lecturer with the School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, HUST.

The use of a reduced set of representative instances in place of the overall training set (TS) would considerably lessen the computational effort. Even though a large number of papers have proposed instance selection approaches, mainly in classification problems, how this selection should be performed, especially in the context of regression, is still an open issue. In this paper, we tackle the instance selection problem in the framework of MOEL of FRBSs through a coevolutionary approach. In the execution of the MOEL, periodically, a single-objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) evolves a population of reduced TSs. The SOGA aims to maximize a purposely defined index which measures how much the Pareto fronts computed by using, respectively, the reduced TS and the overall TS are close to each other: The closer the fronts, the more the reduced TS is representative of the overall TS. During the execution of the MOEL, the rule base and the membership function parameters of the fuzzy sets are concurrently learned by maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the complexity. We tested our approach on 12 large datasets. We adopted reduced TSs composed of 5%, 10%, and 20% of the overall TS. Using nonparametric statistical tests, we verified that with 10% and 20% of the overall TS, the Pareto front approximations that are generated by our coevolutionary approach are comparable with the ones generated by applying the MOEL with the overall TS, although the coevolution allows us to save up to 86.36% of the execution time. In addition, the analysis of the behavior of three representative solutions on the test set highlights that the use of the reduced TSs does not affect the generalization capabilities of the generated FRBSs.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2173582","startPage":"276","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6176019/06061952.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2173582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Training Instance Selection in Multiobjective Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems: A Coevolutionary Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Biological cells","Approximation methods","Complexity theory","Prototypes","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","Pareto optimisation","pattern classification","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic training instance selection","multiobjective evolutionary fuzzy systems","coevolutionary approach","multiobjective evolutionary learning","fuzzy rule-based systems","fitness evaluation","training set","classification problems","regression context","MOEL framework","FRBS","single-objective genetic algorithm","SOGA","membership function parameters","fuzzy sets","nonparametric statistical tests","Pareto front approximations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large datasets","multiobjective evolutionary fuzzy systems (MOEFS)","regression problems","training set selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Training Instance Selection in Multiobjective Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems: A Coevolutionary Approach","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6061952/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639040","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Training Instance Selection in Multiobjective Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems: A Coevolutionary Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-marcelloni-2173582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16981S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6061952","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6061953,"authors":[{"name":"Huai-Ning Wu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6176019/6061953/6061953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huai-Ning Wu was born in Anhui, China, on November 15, 1972.

A fuzzy control design methodology is developed for these systems by combining the PDE theory and the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-model-based control technique. Initially, a T-S fuzzy parabolic PDE model is proposed to accurately represent a semilinear parabolic PDE system. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a Lyapunov technique is used to design a continuous fuzzy state feedback controller such that the closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable with a given decay rate. The stabilization condition is presented in terms of a set of spatial differential linear matrix inequalities (SDLMIs). Furthermore, a recursive algorithm is presented to solve the SDLMIs via the existing linear matrix inequality optimization techniques. Finally, numerical simulations on the temperature profile control of a catalytic rod are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6061953/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639041","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Stabilization for a Class of Nonlinear Parabolic PDE Systems via Fuzzy Control Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Stabilization for a Class of Nonlinear Parabolic PDE Systems via Fuzzy Control Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wu-2173694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112103S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6176019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6176019","articleId":"6061953","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":6061954,"authors":[{"name":"Shang Tan Tu","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6117787/6061954/6061954-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shang Tan Tu received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree from the School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Signal Processing Laboratory.","His research interests include computer vision, machine learning, data mining, and remote sensing."]},"firstName":"Shang Tan","lastName":"Tu","id":"38238058800"},{"name":"Jia Yu Chen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6117787/6061954/6061954-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jia Yu Chen (S'08\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degrees in electronic information engineering and in law, and M.S. graduated in communication and information system from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

We apply Laplacian eigenmaps (LE), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR) technique, to a high-dimensional polarimetric feature representation for PolSAR land-cover classification. A wide variety of polarimetric signatures are chosen to construct a high-dimensional polarimetric manifold which can be mapped into the most compact low-dimensional structure by manifold-based dimensionality reduction techniques. This NDR technique is employed to obtain a low-dimensional intrinsic feature vector by the LE algorithm, which is beneficial to PolSAR land-cover classification owing to its local preserving property. The effectiveness of our PolSAR land-cover classification scheme with LE intrinsic feature vector is demonstrated with the RadarSat-2 C-band PolSAR data set and the 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation X-band PolInSAR data set. The performance of our method is measured by the separability in the feature space and the accuracy of classification. Comparisons on the feature space show that the LE intrinsic feature vector is more separable than different original feature vectors. Our LE intrinsic feature vector also improves the classification accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6117787/06061954.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2168532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2168532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laplacian Eigenmaps-Based Polarimetric Dimensionality Reduction for SAR Image Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Vectors","Laplace equations","Image color analysis","Classification algorithms","Principal component analysis","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feature extraction","geophysical image processing","image classification","radar interferometry","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laplacian eigenmap-based polarimetric dimensionality reduction process","SAR image classification","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","high-dimensional polarimetric feature representation","PolSAR land-cover classification","compact low-dimensional structure","manifold-based dimensionality reduction technique","low-dimensional intrinsic feature vector","Laplacian eigenmap algorithm","RadarSat-2 C-band PolSAR data","X-band PolInSAR data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Land-cover classification","Laplacian eigenmaps (LE)","nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR)","polarimetric manifold","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Laplacian Eigenmaps-Based Polarimetric Dimensionality Reduction for SAR Image Classification","volume":"50","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6061954/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12427086","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laplacian Eigenmaps-Based Polarimetric Dimensionality Reduction for SAR Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tu-2168532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073901S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6117787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6117787","articleId":"6061954","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6061957,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmal Kumar Rout","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6119253/6061957/6061957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nirmal Kumar Rout received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the University College of Engineering (presently known as Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology), Sambalpur University, Burla, India, in 1991 and the M.Tech. degree in computer science from the Utkal University, Bhubaneshwar, India, in 2001.

The ANC is conventionally used to control low-frequency acoustic noise by employing a gradient-optimization-based filtered-X least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm. Hence, there is a possibility that the performance of the ANC may be trapped by local minima problem. In addition, the conventional FXLMS algorithm needs prior identification of the secondary path. The proposed PSO-based ANC algorithm does not require the estimation of secondary path transfer function unlike FXLMS algorithm and, hence, is immune to time-varying nature of the secondary path. In this investigation, a small modification is incorporated in the conventional PSO algorithm to develop a conditional reinitialized PSO algorithm to suit to the time-varying plants of the ANC system. Systematic computer simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the new PSO-based ANC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2169180","startPage":"554","endPage":"563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2169180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6119253/06061957.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Active Noise Control Algorithm Without Secondary Path Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061957/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Active Noise Control Algorithm Without Secondary Path Identification","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6061957/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12438056","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Active Noise Control Algorithm Without Secondary Path Identification","sourcePdf":"tim-das-2169180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114446S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6119253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6119253","articleId":"6061957","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6061958,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Habibi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6145766/6061958/6061958-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Habibi was born in 1981.

In this paper, the performance of different derivatives of the CIS is analyzed, and some modification is applied to the CIS to significantly increase its sensitivity at higher frame rates and reduce its output error. The effect of undesired parameters, such as parasitic capacitances, device mismatches, charge transfers, random noise, and temperature variations, is studied, and modified architectures are proposed to reduce them. The maximum demodulation frequency is also shown to be increased compared to original CIS. The presented designs are compared with previous solutions under similar operating conditions using a 0.35-\u03bcm standard CMOS technology. It is shown that the designs can be used to detect lower modulated signal levels over a wider background dynamic range.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2170916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6145766/06061958.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2170916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Enhancement, and Sensitivity Improvement of the Correlation Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061958/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Enhancement, and Sensitivity Improvement of the Correlation Image Sensor","volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524363","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6061958/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Enhancement, and Sensitivity Improvement of the Correlation Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"tim-habibi-2170916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062802S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6145766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6145766","articleId":"6061958","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6061962,"authors":[{"name":"Gilles Puy","affiliation":["Institute of the Physics of Biological Systems, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9ral de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Puy","id":"38638752400"},{"name":"Jose P.

The method, coined spread spectrum MRI or simply s MRI, consists of premodulating the signal of interest by a linear chirp before random -space under-sampling, and then reconstructing the signal with nonlinear algorithms that promote sparsity. The effectiveness of the procedure is theoretically underpinned by the optimization of the coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases. The proposed technique is thoroughly studied by means of numerical simulations, as well as phantom and in vivo experiments on a 7T scanner.

The optimal MAC retry limit corresponding to the minimum \u201ctotal packet loss rate\u201d is derived by exploiting both mathematical analysis and NS-2 simulations. We have shown that there is an interaction between \"packet overflow drop\" and \"expired-time packet discard\" processes in the queue.

This paper focuses on symmetric NMF (SNMF), which is a special case of NMF decomposition. Three parallel multiplicative update algorithms using level 3 basic linear algebra subprograms directly are developed for this problem. First, by minimizing the Euclidean distance, a multiplicative update algorithm is proposed, and its convergence under mild conditions is proved. Based on it, we further propose another two fast parallel methods: \u03b1-SNMF and \u03b2 -SNMF algorithms. All of them are easy to implement. These algorithms are applied to probabilistic clustering. We demonstrate their effectiveness for facial image clustering, document categorization, and pattern clustering in gene expression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6061964/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409294","pubMedId":"22042156","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization: Algorithms and Applications to Probabilistic Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization: Algorithms and Applications to Probabilistic Clustering","sourcePdf":"tnn-he-pt1-2172457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151053S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6061964","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6061965,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Huei Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6159241/6061965/6061965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Huei Lee (S\u201909) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

The fault diagnostic method utilizes the primary voltage of the transformer as the diagnostic criterion, which can be obtained easily by adding an auxiliary winding. When an open-circuit fault occurs in any switch of the PSFB converter, the proposed fault detection method can generate an indication of the abnormal state and trigger an active-phase-shifted in the control system. Under the APS state, it is very easy to locate the exact position of faulty switch because the voltage waveform of the primary winding heavily depends on the location of the faulty switch. After locating the position of the faulty switch, the PSFB converter is reconfigured into an asymmetrical half-bridge (AHB) converter by turning ON the normal switch in the faulty leg and adding a redundant winding to the secondary side. Therefore, the rebuilt AHB converter can keep the output voltage constant under a reduced power rating after the open-circuit fault. The operational principle, design consideration, and implementation are discussed in this paper. The experimental results are given to verify the validity of theoretical analysis.

With full consideration of both mechanical configuration and propulsive principle of the robot consisting of a yaw joint and multiple pitch joints, a viable approach to perform yaw maneuvers via laterally directed biases is formed, providing an advantage in qualitative and quantitative assessment. Meanwhile, based on the feedback of the pitch angle measured by an onboard gyroscope, a closed-loop control strategy in dorsoventral motions is proposed to achieve agile and swift pitch maneuvers. More remarkably, two hybrid acrobatic stunts, i.e., frontflip and backflip, are first implemented on the physical robot. The latest results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It is also confirmed that the dolphin robot achieves better performance for pitch maneuvers than it does for yaw maneuvers, agreeing well with the biological observations.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2171095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6177749/06061970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2171095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177749","startPage":"318","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Yaw and Pitch Maneuvers of a Multilink Dolphin Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6061970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of Yaw and Pitch Maneuvers of a Multilink Dolphin Robot","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6061970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638959","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6061970/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Yaw and Pitch Maneuvers of a Multilink Dolphin Robot","sourcePdf":"tro-yu-2171095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078124S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6177749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6177749","articleId":"6061970","onlineDate":"26 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6061974,"authors":[{"name":"Meisam Razaviyayn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6061974/6061974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meisam Razaviyayn received the B.Sc. degree from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2008.","During summer 2010, he was working as a research intern at Huawei Technologies.

Traditionally, voltage scaling has been used to reduce both dynamic and leakage power in caches. However, aggressive voltage reduction causes process-variation-induced failures in cache SRAM arrays, which compromise cache reliability. In this paper, we propose Flexible Fault-Tolerant Cache (FFT-Cache) that uses a flexible defect map to configure its architecture to achieve significant reduction in energy consumption through aggressive voltage scaling, while maintaining high error reliability. FFT-Cache uses a portion of faulty cache blocks as redundancy - using block-level or line-level replication within or between sets - to tolerate other faulty caches lines and blocks. Our configuration algorithm categorizes the cache lines based on degree of conflict of their blocks to reduce the granularity of redundancy replacement. FFT-Cache thereby sacrifices a minimal number of cache lines to avoid impacting performance while tolerating the maximum amount of defects. Our experimental results on SPEC2K benchmarks demonstrate that the operational voltage can be reduced down to 375mV, which achieves up to 80% reduction in dynamic power and up to 48% reduction in leakage power with small performance impact and area overhead.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiplexing","Random access memory","Fault tolerant systems","Redundancy","Computer architecture","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","fault tolerant computing","memory architecture","redundancy","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT cache","fault tolerant cache architecture","voltage scaling","cache SRAM arrays","cache reliability","flexible fault tolerant","redundancy","line level replication","block level replication","configuration algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power cache","Fault-tolerant cache","Flexible fault remapping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062035","doi":"10.1145/2038698.2038715","startPage":"95","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045370/6062023/06062035.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062035/","displayDocTitle":"FFT-Cache: A Flexible Fault-Tolerant Cache architecture for ultra low voltage operation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12341062","htmlLink":"/document/6062035/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FFT-Cache: A Flexible Fault-Tolerant Cache architecture for ultra low voltage operation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p95mofrad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063001S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045370","isNumber":"6062023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045370","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6062023","articleId":"6062035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6062037,"authors":[{"name":"John Sartori","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sartori","id":"37391767500"},{"name":"Rakesh Kumar","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37709981500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062037","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062037","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Error analysis","Delay","Registers","Optimization","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","CMOS integrated circuits","computer architecture","error statistics","integrated circuit reliability","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-reliability tradeoffs","CMOS design","Moore law","design-level optimization","error rate behavior","energy saving","architectural optimization","processor architectural optimization","razor-based error resilience"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error resilience","microarchitecture","energy efficiency","timing speculation"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2038698.2038718","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045370/6062023/06062037.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecting processors to allow voltage/reliability tradeoffs","abstract":"Escalating variations in modern CMOS designs have become a threat to Moore's law. While previous works have proposed techniques for tolerating variations by trading reliability for reduced voltage (energy) [10], the benefits of such techniques are limited, because voltage/reliability tradeoffs in conventional processors often introduce more errors than can be gainfully tolerated [14]. Recent work has proposed circuit and design-level optimizations [14, 15] that manipulate the error rate behavior of a design to increase the potential for energy savings from voltage/reliability tradeoffs. In this paper, we investigate whether architectural optimizations can also manipulate error rate behavior to significantly increase the energy savings from voltage/reliability tradeoffs. To this end, we demonstrate how error rate behavior indeed depends on processor architecture, and that architectural optimizations can be used to manipulate the error rate behavior of a processor. We show that architectural optimizations can significantly enhance voltage/reliability tradeoffs, achieving up to 29% additional energy savings for processors that employ Razor-based error resilience.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062037/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12341064","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062037/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Architecting processors to allow voltage/reliability tradeoffs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecting processors to allow voltage/reliability tradeoffs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p115sartori.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.209059S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045370","isNumber":"6062023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045370","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6062023","articleId":"6062037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6062039,"authors":[{"name":"John Sartori","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sartori","id":"37391767500"},{"name":"Joseph Sloan","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Sloan","id":"37545488800"},{"name":"Rakesh Kumar","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37709981500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062039","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Timing","Program processors","Hardware","Optimization","Computer architecture","Resilience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","computer architecture","microprocessor chips","program compilers","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor design","device-level manufacturing","physical circuit characteristic","circuit density","dynamic circuit behavior","Moore's law","compiler","application-level stochastic computing","semiconductor scaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stochastic computing","error resilience"]}],"abstract":"As device sizes shrink, device-level manufacturing challenges have led to increased variability in physical circuit characteristics. Exponentially increasing circuit density has not only brought about concerns in the reliable manufacturing of circuits, but has also exaggerated variations in dynamic circuit behavior. The resulting uncertainty in performance, power, and reliability imposed by compounding static and dynamic non-determinism threatens to halt the continuation of Moore's law, which has been arguably the primary driving force behind technology and innovation for decades. As the marginal benefits of technology scaling continue to languish, a new vision for stochastic computing has begun to emerge. Rather than hiding variations under expensive guardbands, designers have begun to relax traditional correctness constraints and deliberately expose hardware variability to higher levels of the compute stack, thus tapping into potentially significant performance and energy benefits, while exploiting software and hardware error resilience to tolerate errors. In this paper, we present our vision for design, architecture, compiler, and application-level stochastic computing techniques that embrace errors in order to ensure the continued viability of semiconductor scaling.","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045370/6062023/06062039.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062023","startPage":"135","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic computing: Embracing errors in architecture and design of processors and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic computing: Embracing errors in architecture and design of processors and applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341066","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic computing: Embracing errors in architecture and design of processors and applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p135sartori.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060285S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045370","isNumber":"6062023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045370","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6062023","articleId":"6062039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6062045,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Ferreira","affiliation":["Departamento de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37306756300"},{"name":"Julio Goldner Vendramini","affiliation":["Departamento de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil"],"firstName":"Julio Goldner","lastName":"Vendramini","id":"38015250800"},{"name":"Lucas Mucida","affiliation":["Departamento de Informatica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Mucida","id":"38015250100"},{"name":"Monica M.

Despite these advantages, CGRA usage has been limited due to the lack of commercial CGRA circuits. This work proposes a virtual and dynamic CGRA implemented on top of an FPGA. This approach allows the usage of commercial-off-the-shelf FPGA devices combined with the advantages of CGRAs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of heterogeneous functional units (FU) and a global interconnection network. The global network allows any FU to be used at each cycle, which reduces significantly the placement complexity. In addition, we introduce a polynomial mapping algorithm which includes scheduling, placement and routing steps (SPR). Moreover, the proposed approach performs a very fast placement and routing in comparison to similar CGRA approaches. The three SPR steps are computed in few milliseconds. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated for a suite of digital signal processing benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/2038698.2038728","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045370/6062023/06062045.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based heterogeneous coarse-grained dynamically reconfigurable architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062045/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based heterogeneous coarse-grained dynamically reconfigurable architecture","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062045/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341072","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based heterogeneous coarse-grained dynamically reconfigurable architecture","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p195ferreira.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081018S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045370","isNumber":"6062023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045370","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6062023","articleId":"6062045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062048,"authors":[{"name":"Wajid Hassan Minhass","affiliation":["DTU Informatics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Wajid Hassan","lastName":"Minhass","id":"37974555700"},{"name":"Paul Pop","affiliation":["DTU Informatics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Pop","id":"37278880300"},{"name":"Jan Madsen","affiliation":["DTU Informatics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Madsen","id":"37265832800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0713-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062048","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"abstract":"Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers and are able to integrate the necessary functions for biochemical analysis on-chip. There are several types of microfluidic biochips, each having its advantages and limitations. In this paper we are interested in flow-based biochips, in which the flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. By combining several microvalves, more complex units, such as micropumps, switches, mixers, and multiplexers, can be built. Although researchers have proposed significant work on the system-level synthesis of droplet-based biochips, which manipulate droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes, no research on system-level synthesis of flow-based biochips has been reported so far. The focus has been on application modeling and component-level simulation. Therefore, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose a system-level modeling and synthesis approach for flow-based biochips. We have developed a topology graph-based model of the biochip architecture, and we have used a sequencing graph to model the biochemical applications. We consider that the architecture of the biochip is given, and we are interested to synthesize an implementation, consisting of the binding of operations in the application to the functional units of the architecture, the scheduling of operations and the routing and scheduling of the fluid flows, such that the application completion time is minimized. We propose a List Scheduling-based heuristic for solving this problem. The proposed heuristic has been evaluated using two real-life case studies and a set of four synthetic benchmarks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045370/6062023/06062048.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"233","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","doi":"10.1145/2038698.2038733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level modeling and synthesis of flow-based microfluidic biochips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mixers","Valves","Biological system modeling","System-on-a-chip","Reservoirs","Routing","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","micropumps","microvalves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level modeling","flow-based microfluidic biochip","biochemical analysis on-chip","integrated microvalves","micropump","switches","mixers","multiplexers","system-level synthesis","droplet-based biochips","component-level simulation","topology graph-based model","biochip architecture","sequencing graph","fluid flow routing","fluid flow scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microfluidics","biochips","modeling","synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"System-level modeling and synthesis of flow-based microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062048/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341075","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level modeling and synthesis of flow-based microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p225minhass.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12965S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045370","isNumber":"6062023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045370","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6062023","articleId":"6062048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062070,"authors":[{"name":"Sasa Misailovic","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Sasa","lastName":"Misailovic","id":"38015065100"},{"name":"Stelios Sidiroglou","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Stelios","lastName":"Sidiroglou","id":"37563449000"},{"name":"Henry Hoffmann","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37282336000"},{"name":"Martin Rinard","affiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Rinard","id":"37283976600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-719-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"}],"articleNumber":"6062070","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Distortion measurement","Manuals","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","optimisation","quality of service","software metrics","software performance evaluation","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service profiling quality","execution time","video encoder","quality of service profiler","loop perforation","benchmark applications","optimization opportunities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["loop perforation","profiling","quality of service"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1806799.1806808","endPage":"34","startPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062053/6062054/06062070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1806799.1806808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of service profiling","abstract":"Many computations exhibit a trade off between execution time and quality of service. A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly if it is given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance quality of service and performance. We present a new quality of service profiler that is designed to help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a quality of service profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small quality of service losses. Our quality of service profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality of service trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the quality of service, is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented quality of service profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small quality of service losses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062070/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6062070/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12340737","conferenceDate":"2-8 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quality of service profiling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of service profiling","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"87190025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057421S","chronDate":"2-8 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6062053","isNumber":"6062054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062053","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6062054","articleId":"6062070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062071,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

Reliability of the service-oriented systems heavily depends on the remote Web services as well as the unpredictable Internet. Designing effective and accurate reliability prediction approaches for the service-oriented systems has become an important research issue. In this paper, we propose a collaborative reliability prediction approach, which employs the past failure data of other similar users to predict the Web service reliability for the current user, without requiring real-world Web service invocations. We also present a user-collaborative failure data sharing mechanism and a reliability composition model for the service-oriented systems. Large-scale real-world experiments are conducted and the experimental results show that our collaborative reliability prediction approach obtains better reliability prediction accuracy than other approaches.","doi":"10.1145/1806799.1806809","publicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 ACM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062053/6062054/06062071.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1806799.1806809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative reliability prediction of service-oriented systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062071/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative reliability prediction of service-oriented systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"12340738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062071/","conferenceDate":"2-8 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative reliability prediction of service-oriented systems","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"87190035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082142S","chronDate":"2-8 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6062053","isNumber":"6062054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062053","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6062054","articleId":"6062071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062105,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Bacchelli","affiliation":["REVEAL @ Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Bacchelli","id":"37540945900"},{"name":"Michele Lanza","affiliation":["REVEAL @ Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Lanza","id":"37272102400"},{"name":"Romain Robbes","affiliation":["PLEIAD @ DCC & REVEAL, University of Chile, University of Lugano, Chile"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Robbes","id":"37318057000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-719-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"}],"articleNumber":"6062105","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic mail","Benchmark testing","Joining processes","Java","Object oriented modeling","Software systems","Large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic mail","information retrieval","program diagnostics","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["e-mails","source code artifacts","software artifacts","trace-ability issue","unrelated software systems","information retrieval approaches","software maintenance"]}],"abstract":"E-mails concerning the development issues of a system constitute an important source of information about high-level design decisions, low-level implementation concerns, and the social structure of developers. Establishing links between e-mails and the software artifacts they discuss is a non-trivial problem, due to the inherently informal nature of human communication. Different approaches can be brought into play to tackle this trace-ability issue, but the question of how they can be evaluated remains unaddressed, as there is no recognized benchmark against which they can be compared. In this article we present such a benchmark, which we created through the manual inspection of a statistically significant number of e-mails pertaining to six unrelated software systems.

By incorporating knowledge about the temporal behavior of such multi-mode systems, it is possible to share hardware by means of partial reconfiguration, and thus, reduce costs and improve performance. In this paper, we specify the temporal behavior of the functionality by applying known models based on state machines. In addition, we introduce an architectural model that allows to express the characteristics of nowadays partially reconfigurable architectures, focusing on FPGAs. We develop a symbolic encoding of this novel system specification, which allows to perform a unified system synthesis for allocation, binding, placement of partially reconfigurable modules, and routing the on-chip communication. The proposed encoding enables the use of sophisticated optimization techniques, coupling a SAT solver with a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed methodology is highly applicable for building multi-mode systems on advanced reconfigurable technology. We demonstrate this by experiments on test-cases from the image processing domain applying state-of-the-art technology. The results show the superiority of the presented approach in terms of run-time and quality of the found solutions compared to existing system synthesis approaches.","doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039393","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062281.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic design space exploration for multi-mode reconfigurable systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic design space exploration for multi-mode reconfigurable systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341202","htmlLink":"/document/6062281/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic design space exploration for multi-mode reconfigurable systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p129wildermann.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.192326S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045374","isNumber":"6062276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045374","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6062276","articleId":"6062281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6062288,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ebi","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ebi","id":"37542771700"},{"name":"David Kramer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of technology, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37277003700"},{"name":"Wolfgang Karl","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Karl","id":"37341230300"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of technology, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0712-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062288","dbTime":"96 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal management","Temperature measurement","Heating","Computer architecture","Economics","Monitoring","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic learning","thermal-aware power budgeting","many-core architecture","multicore processor","nanoCMOS era","reinforcement learning","power trading strategy","thermal threshold","thermal camera"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Thermal Management","Agent-Based Systems","Multi-Core Architectures","MPSoCs","Proactive Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039401","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062288.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic learning for thermal-aware power budgeting in many-core architectures","abstract":"One of the key challenges for multi-core processors in the nano-CMOS era is dealing with the increased temperatures. It is imperative that peak temperatures are reduced and that heat is spread as evenly on the chip as possible to avoid mutual heating and high thermal gradients between processor cores. Approaches have emerged which share a global power budget among multiple cores in order to meet these objectives. However, while these approaches act proactively in distributing power across the chip before thermal problems arise, changes in the respective strategies remain reactive to a temperature threshold. Our approach uses reinforcement learning in order to dynamically change what we call power trading strategies before thermal thresholds are hit based on past recorded observations. Through learning, our hierarchical approach is also able to distribute so-called multiple power budgets at once thereby making power trading more effective, reaching a decrease in peak temperatures of around 4% compared to a fully distributed approach - which can be critical at near-threshold temperatures in terms of transient errors - while also decreasing the number of deadline misses by a factor of 7. Our technique has been verified by deploying a thermal camera.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062288/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12341209","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062288/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Economic learning for thermal-aware power budgeting in many-core architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic learning for thermal-aware power budgeting in many-core architectures","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p189ebi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054768S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045374","isNumber":"6062276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045374","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6062276","articleId":"6062288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6062295,"authors":[{"name":"Semeen Rehman","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Semeen","lastName":"Rehman","id":"38026967200"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Florian Kriebel","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kriebel","id":"38030389000"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0712-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":678},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software reliability","Registers","Program processors","Hardware","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","estimation theory","fault tolerant computing","optimisation","program compilers","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-aware software transformation","embedded code generation","compilation technique","instruction-level reliability estimation","hardware-level fault","optimization algorithm","fault injection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","dependability","reliability estimation","instruction vulnerability estimation","reliable software","code generation","embedded systems","technology scaling","reliability-aware software transformations"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable software for unreliable hardware: Embedded code generation aiming at reliability","doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","endPage":"246","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039408","startPage":"237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062295","abstract":"A compilation technique for reliability-aware software transformations is presented.

The \u201cdigital\u201d microfluidic biochips (DM-FBs) are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic mi-crofluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools are being developed for DMFBs. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis and chip-level design to testing. Design automations are expected to alleviate the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062306.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Recent research and emerging challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062306/","displayDocTitle":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Recent research and emerging challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341226","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062306/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Recent research and emerging challenges","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p335ho.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13037S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045374","isNumber":"6062276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045374","xplore-issue":"6062276","articleId":"6062306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6062311,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"},{"name":"Paul Pop","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Pop","id":"37278880300"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0712-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062311","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":794},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Medical services","Tutorials","Laboratories","Integrated circuits","Educational institutions","Biochemistry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","bioMEMS","drops","embedded systems","health care","lab-on-a-chip","microfabrication","microfluidics","molecular biophysics","monolithic integrated circuits","nanofluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochips","functional diversity","cyberphysical systems","biomedical chips","embedded systems","health care","biochemistry","droplet based digital microfluidics","biochip devices","laboratory procedure automation","molecular biology","nanoliter volume droplet control","biochemical samples","biochemical reagents","integrated circuit technology","chemical payload","microfluidic droplets","nanofluidic droplets","chip integration","design automation tools","semiconductor IC","biochip compiler","optimized fluidic instructions","executable fluidic instructions","sensor integration","control software","cyberphysical framework","actuation methods","electrowetting","microfabrication processes","system level design automation","synthesis techniques","droplet routing","defect tolerance","chip level design","pin constrained biochip design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microfluidics","biochips","system-on-chip","design automation"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. The 2010 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that bio-medical chips will soon revolutionize the healthcare market. These bio-medical chips should be able to sense and actuate, store and manipulate data, and transmit information. To realize such bio-medical chips, the integration of embedded systems and microfluidics inevitably leads to a new research dimension for More than Moore and beyond. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the emerging technology of digital microfluidics, which is poised to play a key role in the transformation of healthcare and the interplay between biochemistry and embedded systems. Advances in droplet-based \u201cdigital\u201d microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochip devices for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter-volume droplets of biochemical samples and reagents. Therefore, integrated circuit (IC) technology can be used to transport and transport \u201cchemical payload\u201d in the form of micro/nanofluidic droplets. As a result, non-traditional biomedical applications and markets (e.g., high-throughout DNA sequencing, portable and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, protein crystallization for drug discovery), and fundamentally new uses are opening up for ICs and systems. However, continued growth (and larger revenues resulting from technology adoption by pharmaceutical and healthcare companies) depends on advances in chip integration and design-automation tools. In particular, design-automation tools are needed to ensure that biochips are as versatile as the macro-labs that they are intended to replace. This is therefore an opportune time for the semiconductor industry and circuit/system designers to make an impact in this emerging field. This tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor ICs/systems industry with the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. The audience will see how a \u201cbiochip compiler\u201d can translate protocol descriptions provided by an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the underlying digital microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. Sensor integration and close coupling between the underlying hardware and the control software in a cyberphysical framework will also be described. A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Commercial devices and advanced prototypes from the major company in this market segment (Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc.) will be described, and ongoing activity on newborn screening using digital microfluidic biochips at several large hospitals in Illinois will be highlighted. The topics covered in the tutorial include the following: 1) Technology and application drivers: Motivation and background, actuation methods, electrowetting and digital microfluidics, review of micro-fabrication processes, applications to biochemistry, medicine, and laboratory procedures. 2) System-level design automation: Synthesis techniques: scheduling of fluidic operations, resource binding (mapping of operations to on-chip resources), module placement. 3) Physical-level design automation: droplet routing, defect tolerance, chip-level design, and design of pin-constrained biochips. 4) Testing and design-for-testability: Defects, fault modeling, test planning, reconfiguration techniques, sensor integration and cyberphysical system design.","doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039430","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","startPage":"377","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Functional diversity, More than Moore, and cyberphysical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Functional diversity, More than Moore, and cyberphysical systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062311/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341231","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062311/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital microfluidic biochips: Functional diversity, More than Moore, and cyberphysical systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p377chakrabarty.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04757S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045374","isNumber":"6062276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045374","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6062276","articleId":"6062311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062318,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Pilato","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Pilato","id":"37392699300"},{"name":"Fabrizio Ferrandi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Ferrandi","id":"37298982800"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0715-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0712-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062318","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design methodology to implement memory accesses in High-Level Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Arrays","Random access memory","Memory management","Hardware","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","formal specification","high level synthesis","parallel memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory synthesis","hardware accelerator","design methodology","memory access","high-level synthesis","design constraints","memory architecture","specification execution","parallel memory","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memory Optimization","High-Level Synthesis"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, the memory synthesis is becoming the main bottleneck for the generation of efficient hardware accelerators. This paper presents a design methodology to efficiently and automatically implement memory accesses in High-Level Synthesis. In particular, the approach starts from a behavioral specification (in pure C language) and a set of design constraints, such as the memory addresses where some of the data are stored. The methodology classifies which variables can be internally or externally allocated to the different modules to generate the proper architecture, fully supporting a wide range of C constructs, such as pointer arithmetic, function calls and array accesses. Moreover it allows to parallelize the accesses when the memory address is known at compile time, resulting in an efficient execution of the specification.","doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039381","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on

However, memory controller design has so far largely focused on improving average-case performance. As a consequence, the latency of memory accesses is unpredictable, which complicates the worst-case execution time analysis necessary for hard real-time embedded systems. Our work introduces a novel DRAM controller design that is predictable and that significantly reduces worst-case access latencies. Instead of viewing the DRAM device as one resource that can only be shared as a whole, our approach views it as multiple resources that can be shared between one or more clients individually. We partition the physical address space following the internal structure of the DRAM device, i.e., its ranks and banks, and interleave accesses to the blocks of this partition. This eliminates contention for shared resources within the device, making accesses temporally predictable and temporally isolated. This paper describes our DRAM controller design and its integration with a precision-timed (PRET) architecture called PTARM. We present analytical bounds on the latency and throughput of the proposed controller, and confirm these via simulation.","doi":"10.1145/2039370.2039388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039388","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6045374/6062276/06062323.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRET DRAM controller: Bank privatization for predictability and temporal isolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PRET DRAM controller: Bank privatization for predictability and temporal isolation","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12341243","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062323/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRET DRAM controller: Bank privatization for predictability and temporal isolation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p99reineke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060579S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6045374","isNumber":"6062276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6045374","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6062276","articleId":"6062323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":6062377,"authors":[{"name":"Withawat Withayachumnankul","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6178352/6062377/6062377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Withawat Withayachumnankul (M'11) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng degrees in electronic engineering from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology at Ladkrabang (KMITL), Bangkok, Thailand, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia, in 2010.","He served as a Lecturer at KMITL with the Faculty of Engineering.

Each SRR exhibits a unique high-Q resonance that is sensitive to the presence of a sample in a particular area. Hence, this SRR-based sensor can function (i) to detect different samples simultaneously to increase the throughput or (ii) to characterise nominally identical samples at multiple frequencies to increase the sensor selectivity. In addition, the sensitivity of this SRR-based sensor is optimized through strategic design of the resonator shape to produce a strong confined electric field at each sensing region. The design principle is validated with simulation and measurement. Owing to the optimized design, sensing a low-permittivity film with a thickness as small as one thousandth of the operating wavelength is achievable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062377/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12650351","volume":"12","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Metamaterial-Inspired Multichannel Thin-Film Sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamaterial-Inspired Multichannel Thin-Film Sensor","sourcePdf":"jsen-withayachumnankul-2173762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089414S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"6062377","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6062382,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunbeom Lee","affiliation":["Korea Telecom, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunbeom","lastName":"Lee","id":"37440859000"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6062382","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":640},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In cellular systems, a basestation and mobile stations need to be synchronized before data exchange. Since the basestation clock reference is more accurate, a mobile station typically derives its clock reference from the basestation. But the carrier frequency offset due to Doppler shift may have harmful effects on the local clock derivation. This letter proposes a joint clock and frequency synchronization technique between a basestation and a mobile station, which is effective even with Doppler shift. We derive the joint estimation algorithm by analyzing the phase and the amplitude distortion caused by the sampling frequency offset and the carrier frequency offset.

The discontinuous control that leads to a finite-time reaching of the sliding surface creates fast-time transients analogous to the stable boundary layer dynamics of a singularly perturbed system. As the sliding mode is attained, the slow-time dynamics prevails, just as that of a singularly perturbed system after the boundary layer dynamics fades away. In this technical note, the problem of sliding mode control for singularly perturbed systems in the presence of matched bounded external disturbances is investigated. A composite sliding surface is constructed from solutions of algebraic Lyapunov equations which are derived from both the fast and the slow subsystems. The resultant sliding motion ensures Lyapunov stability with disturbance rejection. Two proposed schemes that ensure the asymptotic stability of the system are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated in a numerical example of a magnetic tape control system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6157057/06062384.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2173775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2173775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Structure Control for Singularly Perturbed Linear Continuous Systems With Matched Disturbances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","Lyapunov methods","Equations","Control design","Asymptotic stability","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","continuous systems","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","singularly perturbed systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure control","singularly perturbed linear continuous system","matched disturbance","variable structure system","singular perturbation theory","discontinuous control","stable boundary layer dynamics","sliding mode control","composite sliding surface","algebraic Lyapunov equation","resultant sliding motion","Lyapunov stability","asymptotic stability","magnetic tape control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov functions","singularly perturbed systems","sliding mode","variable structure control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Variable Structure Control for Singularly Perturbed Linear Continuous Systems With Matched Disturbances","volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6062384/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12557832","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Structure Control for Singularly Perturbed Linear Continuous Systems With Matched Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tac-nguyen-2173775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080567S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6157057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6157057","articleId":"6062384","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062386,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Novello","affiliation":["Ente per le Nuove tecnologie, lEnergia elAmbiente (ENEA) sulla Fusione, Consorzio RFX-Associazione European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Novello was born in 1978.

One major challenge in this implementation is to design systems that are robust to image variations. In order to meet this challenge, it is important to learn the systems on a large number of labeled images from a different range of variation. However, acquiring labeled images is quite difficult in this domain, and hence, the labeled training data are typically very limited. Although the issue of having limited labeled data is acknowledged by many researchers, it has rarely been considered in the system design. This paper successfully addresses this issue, introducing a new resampling framework to simulate variations in tissue images. This framework generates multiple sequences from an image for its representation and models them using a Markov process. Working with colon tissue images, our experiments show that this framework increases the generalization capacity of a learner by increasing the size and variation of the training data and improves the classification performance of a given image by combining the decisions obtained on its sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062388/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425382","pubMedId":"22049357","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Resampling-Based Markovian Model for Automated Colon Cancer Diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resampling-Based Markovian Model for Automated Colon Cancer Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tbme-gunduzdemir-2173934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081944S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6106028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6106028","articleId":"6062388","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6062389,"authors":[{"name":"Shutao Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6132598/6062389/6062389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shutao Li (M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 1995, 1997, and 2001, respectively.","In 2001, he joined the College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University.

Our learning approach is composed of two main parts: sparse coding and dictionary updating. On the sparse coding stage, an efficient algorithm named multiple clusters pursuit (MCP) is proposed. The MCP first applies a dictionary structuring strategy to cluster the atoms with high coherence together, and then employs a multiple-selection strategy to select several competitive atoms at each iteration. These two strategies can greatly reduce the computation complexity of the MCP and assist it to obtain better sparse solution. On the dictionary updating stage, the alternating optimization that efficiently approximates the singular value decomposition is introduced. Furthermore, in the 3-D medical image denoising application, a joint 3-D operation is proposed for taking the learning capabilities of the presented algorithm to simultaneously capture the correlations within each slice and correlations across the nearby slices, thereby obtaining better denoising results. The experiments on both synthetically generated data and real 3-D medical images demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to some well-known methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Dictionary Learning Algorithm and Its Application to 3-D Medical Image Denoising","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2173935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6132598/06062389.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2173935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Dictionary Learning Algorithm and Its Application to 3-D Medical Image Denoising","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6062389/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477343","pubMedId":"22049358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Dictionary Learning Algorithm and Its Application to 3-D Medical Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"tbme-li-2173935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095025S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6132598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6132598","articleId":"6062389","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062390,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Augustine","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6074986/6062390/6062390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Charles Augustine (S'08) received the Bachelor's degree in electronics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India, in 2004.

Spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junction (STT-MTJ) is a promising nonvolatile memory device with comparable read and write performances as SRAM and eDRAM with almost zero standby power. In this paper, we present a simulation framework that can solve transport [using nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism] and magnet dynamics [using Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation] self-consistently to study the read and write performances of STT-MTJ. Due to process variations, thermal disturbances, and stray fields, the performance of STT-MTJ degrades and results in one transistor-one STT-MTJ (IT-ISTTMTJ) memory failures. A thorough memory design space investigation can help us to reduce such failures.

The system consists of a pair of transceivers and a plastic waveguide. Millimeter wave signal is transmitted in a low-cost long piece of solid plastic dielectric acting as a waveguide. The plastic waveguide medium offers a large bandwidth for data communication using mm-wave carrier frequencies. Plastic waveguide interconnects do not require costly electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical conversion devices or precise alignment and offer longer transmission distances than wireless solutions due to better field confinement and lower path loss. Multiple plastic waveguides can be used in parallel and the modulated data at different frequencies can be multiplexed to increase the data rate. The demonstrated transceiver chips operate at carrier frequencies of 57 GHz and 80 GHz, and are fabricated in 40 nm low-power logic CMOS. The total area and power consumption of two transceivers are 0.41 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 140 mW, respectively.

RES is a well-known random sampling method that samples high-frequency periodic signals using low-frequency sampling circuits. It has been incorporated in modern digital oscilloscopes. However, the efficiency and accuracy of RES may be sensitive to timing uncertainty of analog RES circuits. For signals with sparsely populated harmonic components, the CS-based signal reconstruction method promises to mitigate the inherent timing error and to enhance the overall performance. A novel measurement matrix motivated by the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula is proposed for this purpose. Experiments indicate that, for spectrally sparse signal, the CS-reconstructed waveform exhibits a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than that using the traditional time-alignment method. A prototype realization of this proposed CS-RES method has been developed using off-the-shelf components. It is able to capture analog waveforms at an equivalent sampling rate of 25 GHz while sampled at 100 MHz physically.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2170729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6145766/06062411.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2170729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Random Equivalent Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062411/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Random Equivalent Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524364","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062411/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Random Equivalent Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tim-zhao-2170729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6145766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6145766","articleId":"6062411","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062413,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar B.

However, regenerating codes possess in addition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary subset of nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional repair, there is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the bandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional repair is exact repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical to that in the failed node. Exact repair is of interest as it greatly simplifies system implementation. The first result of this paper is an explicit, exact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding to the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when . This code has a particularly simple graphical description, and most interestingly has the ability to carry out exact repair without any need to perform arithmetic operations. We term this ability of the code to perform repair through mere transfer of data as repair by transfer. The second result of this paper shows that the interior points on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff cannot be achieved under exact repair, thus pointing to the existence of a separate tradeoff under exact repair. Specifically, we identify a set of scenarios which we term as \u201chelper node pooling,\u201d and show that it is the necessity to satisfy such scenarios that overconstrains the system.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6157047/06062413.pdf","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Storage Codes With Repair-by-Transfer and Nonachievability of Interior Points on the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062413/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Storage Codes With Repair-by-Transfer and Nonachievability of Interior Points on the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12557594","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062413/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Storage Codes With Repair-by-Transfer and Nonachievability of Interior Points on the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"tit-kumar-2173792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091572S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6157047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"6157047","articleId":"6062413","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062416,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen Vunckx","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, K.U.

One way to implement this, is to use the anatomical image for defining the a priori distribution in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) reconstruction algorithm. In this contribution, we use the PET-SORTEO Monte Carlo simulator to evaluate the quantitative accuracy reached by three different anatomical priors when reconstructing positron emission tomography (PET) brain images, using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide the anatomical information. The priors are: 1) a prior especially developed for FDG PET brain imaging, which relies on a segmentation of the MR-image (Baete , 2004); 2) the joint entropy-prior (Nuyts, 2007); 3) a prior that encourages smoothness within a position dependent neighborhood, computed from the MR-image. The latter prior was recently proposed by our group in (Vunckx and Nuyts, 2010), and was based on the prior presented by Bowsher (2004). The two latter priors do not rely on an explicit segmentation, which makes them more generally applicable than a segmentation-based prior. All three priors produced a compromise between noise and bias that was clearly better than that obtained with postsmoothed maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) or MAP with a relative difference prior. The performance of the joint entropy prior was slightly worse than that of the other two priors. The performance of the segmentation-based prior is quite sensitive to the accuracy of the segmentation. In contrast to the joint entropy-prior, the Bowsher-prior is easily tuned and does not suffer from convergence problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12571177","pubMedId":"22049363","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6062416/","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Three MRI-Based Anatomical Priors for Quantitative PET Brain Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Three MRI-Based Anatomical Priors for Quantitative PET Brain Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-vunckx-2173766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080301S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6159236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6159236","articleId":"6062416","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6062423,"authors":[{"name":"Saikat Chatterjee","affiliation":["Communication Theory Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6062423/6062423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saikat Chatterjee received the Ph.D. degree from Indian Institute of Science, India, in 2009.","He is a researcher at Communication Theory Lab, KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, where he pursued one-year postdoctoral study.

For serial atom selection, we devise two new schemes to select an atom from a set of potential atoms in each iteration. The two new schemes lead to two new algorithms. For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential atoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we propose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of potential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look-ahead strategy such that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on the future iterations. The use of look-ahead strategy requires a higher computational resource. To achieve a tradeoff between performance and complexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new algorithm.

From the literature, one can find extensive discussions in many aspects of MC-CDMA under a flat system architecture either for conventional or currently emerging cognitive radio (CR) systems. In this paper, we shift the focus from the flat architecture to the hierarchical architecture based on 2-D-spread multicarrier direct-sequenced CDMA, in which a microcell is embedded in the primitive macrocell. However, in such a hierarchical architecture, severe intercell interference can occur between the macrocell and the microcell. Via the interference avoidance code assignment strategy, this kind of intercell interference in downlink transmissions can be eliminated. To this end, we define the white, gray, and black spreading codes to facilitate the management of spreading code resources. Properly allocating the white and gray spreading codes but the black ones can achieve a higher spectrum efficiency without harming the macrocell users. For the purpose of evaluating the candidacy of the gray spreading codes, a sophisticated interference analysis is conducted to define a new multiple access interference (MAI) coefficient to quantize the amount of interference imposed on a microcell user. With the help of the new MAI coefficient, a less-interfered white or gray spreading code can be assigned to microcell users, which can bring about an extra 55% of call admissions in one of our considered cases. Moreover, the capability of the proposed hierarchical system architecture, as well as the interference management scheme for developing the femtocell system, has also been proved via simulation results with a large number of femtocells. It is believed that by cooperating with the substream deactivation technique, the proposed spreading code management associated with the hierarchical system architecture can be a potential prototype of the CR-based femtocell system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2173808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06062426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2173808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"166","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interference-Avoidance Code Assignment Strategy for the Hierarchical Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA System: A Prototype of Cognitive Radio Femtocell System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Interference-Avoidance Code Assignment Strategy for the Hierarchical Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA System: A Prototype of Cognitive Radio Femtocell System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471781","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6062426/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interference-Avoidance Code Assignment Strategy for the Hierarchical Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA System: A Prototype of Cognitive Radio Femtocell System","sourcePdf":"tvt-chang-2173808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204617S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6062426","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062427,"authors":[{"name":"Qimin You","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Qimin","lastName":"You","id":"37718030000"},{"name":"Zhuo Chen","affiliation":["Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278563800"},{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6062427","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Bidirectional control","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Fading","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","network coding","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop transmission scheme","network coding","two-way relay fading channel","detect-and-forward relay protocol","two-way relay channel","odd relays","bit error rate","flat Rayleigh fading channel","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","asymptotic BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional relaying","detect-and-forward (DF)","fading channels","multihop transmission","network coding (NC)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and analyze a multihop transmission scheme based on detect-and-forward (DF) relay protocol and network coding (NC) for two-way relay channels.

With cell phones becoming ubiquitous computing devices, cell phone localization has become an important research problem. In this paper, we present CellSense, which is a probabilistic received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based fingerprinting location determination system for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) phones. We discuss the challenges of implementing a probabilistic fingerprinting localization technique in GSM networks and present the details of the CellSense system and how it addresses these challenges. We then extend the proposed system using a hybrid technique that combines probabilistic and deterministic estimations to achieve both high accuracy and low computational overhead. Moreover, the accuracy of the hybrid technique is robust to changes in its parameter values. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented CellSense on Android-based phones. Results from two different testbeds, representing urban and rural environments, for three different cellular providers show that CellSense provides at least 108.57% enhancement in accuracy in rural areas and at least 89.03% in urban areas compared with current state-of-the-art RSSI-based GSM localization systems. In additional, the proposed hybrid technique provides more than 6 and 5.4 times reduction in computational requirements compared with state-of-the-art RSSI-based GSM localization systems for rural and urban testbeds, respectively. We also evaluate the effect of changing the different system parameters on the accuracy-complexity tradeoff and how the cell tower and fingerprint densities affect system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2173771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06062428.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2173771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6062428/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471783","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System","sourcePdf":"tvt-youssef-2173771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059394S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6062428","onlineDate":"27 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062430,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Inac","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Inac","id":"37541240400"},{"name":"Berke Cetinoneri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Berke","lastName":"Cetinoneri","id":"37541215200"},{"name":"Mehmet Uzunkol","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Uzunkol","id":"37541240800"},{"name":"Yusuf A.

To our knowledge, our DAC offers the highest sampling rate of any previously reported DAC, and it can be applied to 400-Gb/s/ch-class optical communications systems.","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062479","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062355/6062429/06062479.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-GS/s 6-Bit DAC in 0.5-\u00b5m InP HBT Technology for Optical Communications Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A 60-GS/s 6-Bit DAC in 0.5-\u00b5m InP HBT Technology for Optical Communications Systems","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062479/","accessionNumber":"12342983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062479/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-GS/s 6-Bit DAC in 0.5-\u00b5m InP HBT Technology for Optical Communications Systems","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"g03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05336S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062355","isNumber":"6062429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062355","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6062429","articleId":"6062479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6062480,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas B.

A 40 V-500 mA medium-bias design achieves a lower NF ~ 2.5 dB, an OIP3 of 48.4 dBm and a P1dB of 36.8 dBm. This combination of high linear IP3 and low NF exceeds that achieved by many state-of-the-art PHEMT, HBT and HFET technologies for decade-BW MMIC amplifiers operating in the S- and C-band frequency regime. The cascode approach is used to distribute voltage and self-heating in order to lower the Tj and NF while providing high linearity by operating from a higher supply voltage. These results suggest promise for next generation CATV, FTTX, software defined radio and BTS applications which demand higher linearity and BW to satisfy the high data throughput systems of the future.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062481","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062355/6062429/06062481.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8-Watt 250-3000 MHz Low Noise GaN MMIC Feedback Amplifier with > +50 dBm OIP3","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An 8-Watt 250-3000 MHz Low Noise GaN MMIC Feedback Amplifier with > +50 dBm OIP3","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062481/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12342985","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062481/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8-Watt 250-3000 MHz Low Noise GaN MMIC Feedback Amplifier with > +50 dBm OIP3","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"n01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071042S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062355","isNumber":"6062429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062355","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6062429","articleId":"6062481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6062482,"authors":[{"name":"James J.

The amplifier employs a single integrated circuit (IC) GaN RF PA which achieves greater than 12 W output power with greater than 50% drain efficiency under CW excitation. When used in the envelope tracking system with a 6.6 dB PAPR downlink single-carrier WCDMA signal, the GaN PA IC achieves 4 W of output power with 31% system efficiency (RF PA achieved 58.5% drain efficiency) at 752 MHz. Across the frequency range 500 MHz to 1.75 GHz, greater than 2 W with greater than 25% efficiency was demonstrated for the same WCDMA signal using the same configuration and biases for the RFPA and envelope amplifier, without changing impedance matching as the RF center frequency was tuned across the band. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first report of an envelope tracking power amplifier operated over carrier frequencies covering more than one octave range.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Radio frequency","Gallium nitride","Gain","Modulation","Frequency measurement","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["envelope tracking power amplifier","one octave carrier bandwidth","integrated circuit","IC","RF PA","PAPR downlink single-carrier WCDMA signal","frequency 500 MHz to 1.75 GHz","gain 6.6 dB","frequency 752 MHz","GaN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062485","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062355/6062429/06062485.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2011.6062485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaN Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier with More Than One Octave Carrier Bandwidth","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GaN Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier with More Than One Octave Carrier Bandwidth","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062485/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062485/","accessionNumber":"12342989","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaN Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier with More Than One Octave Carrier Bandwidth","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"n05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038441S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062355","isNumber":"6062429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062355","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6062429","articleId":"6062485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6062487,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Laemmle","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Laemmle","id":"37392289500"},{"name":"Klaus Schmalz","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Schmalz","id":"37318178100"},{"name":"Christoph Scheytt","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Scheytt","id":"37374153500"},{"name":"Dietmar Kissinger","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Kissinger","id":"37400279800"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-712-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-711-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-710-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-8781"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1550-8781"}],"articleNumber":"6062487","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Frequency measurement","Transmission line measurements","Voltage measurement","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Biomedical measurements","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","BiCMOS integrated circuits","carbon","Ge-Si alloys","modulators","network analysers","probes","reflectometers","S-parameters","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprobe reflectometer","dielectric sensor readout","BiCMOS technology","resonator-based dielectric sensors","voltage-controlled oscillator","amplitude modulator","capacitive tapped line","power detectors","dummy sensor","S-parameters","vector network analyzer","frequency 122 GHz","voltage 3.75 V","power 319 mW","frequency 190 GHz","SiGe:C"]}],"abstract":"In this publication a fully integrated multiprobe reflectometer at 122 GHz is presented.

In addition to the shot noise, we consider the impacts of both turbulence amplitude fluctuations and phase fluctuations on the error performance. Error rate analyses of predetection and postdetection equal gain combining (EGC) are carried out. We derive the exact error rate expressions for predetection and postdetection EGC using a characteristic function method. In the case of predetection EGC, we also study the impact of phase noise compensation error on the error rate performance. It is shown that the error rate performance of predetection EGC is sensitive to phase noise compensation errors for both weak and strong turbulence conditions. In order to alleviate the impact of phase noise, postdetection EGC with differential phase-shift keying is introduced and analyzed. In addition, postdetection EGC is compared with predetection EGC in the presence of phase noise compensation errors, and it is found to be an effective alternative to predetection EGC with low complexity implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","publicationDate":"November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062623/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425151","volume":"3","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Wireless Optical Communications With Predetection and Postdetection EGC Over Gamma\u2013Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Wireless Optical Communications With Predetection and Postdetection EGC Over Gamma\u2013Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169475S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6102629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6102629","articleId":"6062623","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6062624,"authors":[{"name":"Friederike Brendel","affiliation":["Institut de Micro\u00e9lectronique, Electromagn\u00e9tisme et Photonique/Institut National Polytechnique Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"p":["Friederike Brendel received the Dipl.

The simulations presented herein give hints for the design of dedicated mode-locked lasers that can later serve in dispersion-tolerant radio-over-fiber networks. The findings of the simulations are experimentally validated for a laser delivering a 60 GHz radio carrier, and for a link of 400 m length which represents a realistic link length for in-house distribution.

Moreover, bandwidth demand projections suggest that terabit aggregate capacity may need to be reached in such next-generation passive optical networks (PON). To satisfy these requirements while leveraging the large investments made in existing fiber plants, a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)-based long-reach PON architecture combined with a multiple access technology that features a passive last-mile split, large per-\u03bb speeds, and statistical bandwidth multiplexing can be exploited. In this paper, the first terabit PON based on hybrid WDM orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology is proposed and experimentally verified. To enable high-speed, long-reach transmission with simplified optical network unit (ONU)-side digital signal processing, multiband OFDMA with ONU-side sub-band selectivity is proposed. Design challenges and tradeoffs between analog and digital domain sub-band combining and selection are also discussed. Finally, the experimental setup and results of the first 1.2 Tb/s (1 Tb/s after overhead) symmetric WDM-OFDMA-PON over 90 km straight single-mode fiber and 1:32 passive split, featuring multiband OFDMA, digitally selective ONUs, and a coherent-receiver OLT are presented and analyzed. By supporting up to 800 ONUs with 1.25/10 Gb/s guaranteed/peak rates and exhibiting a record rate-distance product achieved in long-reach PON, the demonstrated architecture may be viewed as promising for future converged terabit optical metro/access.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terabit Optical Access Networks Based on WDM-OFDMA-PON","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2173905","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6139287/06062625.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2173905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2012","displayDocTitle":"Terabit Optical Access Networks Based on WDM-OFDMA-PON","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6062625/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2012","accessionNumber":"12503828","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terabit Optical Access Networks Based on WDM-OFDMA-PON","sourcePdf":"jlt-cvijetic-2173905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13744S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6139287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6139287","articleId":"6062625","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062630,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Richter","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Richter (S'09) received the Dipl.-Ing.

For 5.1-Tb/s transmission over 80-km DMF, the BER of all 128 OTDM-tributaries (both polarizations) is found to be below the hard-decision FEC-threshold, corresponding to an error-free net data rate of 4.8 Tb/s. In a 10.2-Tb/s experiment, the BER of all 256 TDM-tributaries (both polarizations) is found to be below the FEC-threshold in the back-to-back configuration. This translates to an error-free net data rate of 9.5 Tb/s.

These networks can be useful for a large number of applications, including habitat monitoring, structural health monitoring, pipeline monitoring, transportation, precision agriculture, supply chain management, and many more. Typically, a wireless sensor network consists of a large number of simple nodes which operate with exhaustible batteries, unattended. Manual replacement or recharging the batteries is not an easy or desirable task. Hence, how energy is utilized by the various hardware subsystems of individual nodes directly affects the scope and usefulness of the entire network. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art of dynamic power management (DPM) in wireless sensor networks. It investigates aspects of power dissipation in a node and analyses the strength and limitations of selective switching, dynamic frequency, and voltage scaling.","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6178352/06062637.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2174149","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2011.2174149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062637","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Random access memory","Sensors","Batteries","Switches","Hardware","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power management","wireless sensor networks","habitat monitoring","structural health monitoring","pipeline monitoring","transportation","precision agriculture","supply chain management","DPM","voltage scaling","dynamic frequency","selective switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock gating","dynamic frequency scaling","dynamic power management","dynamic voltage scaling","embedded systems","power gating","selective switching","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks: State-of-the-Art","accessionNumber":"12650353","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6062637/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks: State-of-the-Art","sourcePdf":"jsen-dargie-2174149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093366S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"6062637","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6062643,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The proposed antenna is able to transmit and receive information independently using TE and HE modes in the LTE bands 12 (698-716 MHz, 728-746 MHz) and 17 (704-716 MHz, 734-746 MHz). A systematic design method based on perturbation theory is proposed to induce mode degeneration for MIMO operation. Through perturbing the boundary of the DRA, the amount of energy stored by a specific mode is changed as well as the resonant frequency of that mode. Hence, by introducing an adequate boundary perturbation, the TE and HE modes of the DRA will resonate at the same frequency and share a common impedance bandwidth. The simulated mutual coupling between the modes was as low as - 40 dB . It was estimated that in a rich scattering environment with an Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 20 dB per receiver branch, the proposed MIMO DRA was able to achieve a channel capacity of 11.1 b/s/Hz (as compared to theoretical maximum 2 \u00d7 2 capacity of 13.4 b/s/Hz).

The key point of this method is a frequency map between single-band resonators and multiple-band networks formed by those resonators with additional resonators coupled to them. The mapping problem is a non-linear one and the mathematical treatment, based on mapping the cut-off frequencies, is not simple. However, the resulting method is quite straightforward: first, synthesize a single-band equivalent filter; then, couple to each resonator a set of as many resonators as pass bands minus one, being the sets identical between them.

Electric vehicles have not only large introduction potential but also much available time for control because they are almost plugged in the home outlets as distributed battery energy storages. Therefore, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is expected to be one of the key technologies in smart grid strategies. This paper proposes an autonomous distributed V2G control scheme. A grid-connected electric vehicle supplies a distributed spinning reserve according to the frequency deviation at the plug-in terminal, which is a signal of supply and demand imbalance in the power grid. As a style of EV utilization, it is assumed that vehicle use set next plug-out timing in advance. In such assumption, user convenience is satisfied by performing a scheduled charging for the plug-out, and plug-in idle time is available for the V2G control. Therefore a smart charging control is considered in the proposed scheme. Satisfaction of vehicle user convenience and effect to the load frequency control is evaluated through a simulation by using a typical two area interconnected power grid model and an automotive lithium-ion battery model.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2167993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06062663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2167993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","startPage":"559","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Distributed V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Satisfying Scheduled Charging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Distributed V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Satisfying Scheduled Charging","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543443","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6062663/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Distributed V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Satisfying Scheduled Charging","sourcePdf":"tsg-ota-2167993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064409S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6062663","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062664,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Aubertin","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Micro\u00e9lectronique et Microsyst\u00e9mes, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6252108/6062664/6062664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philippe Aubertin (S'10\u2013M'11) received the B.Ing. and M.Sc.A degrees in electrical engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

The intended application is real-time processing of high definition video. The approach aims at an efficient utilization of the available memory bandwidth by fully exploiting the data parallelism inherent to the target algorithm class. An appropriate choice of custom instructions and application-specific registers is used together with a very long instruction word architecture in order to mimic a pipelined systolic array. This leads to a processing speed close to the limit imposed by memory bandwidth constraints. For three intra-field deinterlacing algorithms and 2-D convolution with four kernel sizes, the design approach yields speedup factors between 36 and 1330, Area-Time (AT) product improvements between 12\u00d7 and 243\u00d7, and energy consumption reduction factors between 13 and 262.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2170204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"2031","endPage":"2043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2170204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6252108","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6252108/06062664.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","High definition video","Program processors","Real time systems","Computer architecture","Application specific processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","parallel architectures","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time computation","local neighborhood functions","application-specific instruction-set processors","high speed computation","intrafield deinterlacing","high definition video","data parallelism","very long instruction word architecture","pipelined systolic array","memory bandwidth constraints","2D convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs)","deinterlacing","local neighborhood functions","video processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Computation of Local Neighborhood Functions in Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062664/","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6062664/","accessionNumber":"12884087","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Computation of Local Neighborhood Functions in Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-aubertin-2170204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089456S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6062664","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6062669,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Angelo Meles","affiliation":["Earth and Planetary Science Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","Institute of Geophysics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6186874/6062669/6062669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giovanni Angelo Meles received the M.Sc. degree in physics from the Universit\u00e3 Statale di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2011.

By exploiting the full radar waveforms, it is possible to improve resolution and, thus, image subwavelength features not resolvable using ray-based approaches. Usually, mere convergence in the data space is the only criterion used to appraise the goodness of a final result, possibly limiting the reliability of the inversion. A better indication of the correctness of an inverted model and its various parts could be obtained by means of a formal model resolution and information content analysis. We present a novel method for computing the sensitivity functions (Jacobian matrix) based on a time-domain adjoint method. Because the new scheme only computes the sensitivity values for the transmitter and receiver combinations that are used, it reduces the number of forward runs with respect to standard brute-force or other virtual-source schemes. The procedure has been implemented by using a standard finite-difference time-domain modeling method. A comparison between cumulative sensitivity (column sum of absolute values of the Jacobian) images, which is sometimes used in geoelectrical studies as a proxy for resolution in practical cases, and formal model resolution images is also presented. We show that the cumulative sensitivity supplies some valuable information about the image, but when possible, formal resolution analyses should be performed. The eigenvalue spectrum of the pseudo-Hessian matrix provides a measure of the information content of an experiment and shows the extent of the unresolved model space.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2170078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6186874/06062669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2170078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186874","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPR Full-Waveform Sensitivity and Resolution Analysis Using an FDTD Adjoint Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPR Full-Waveform Sensitivity and Resolution Analysis Using an FDTD Adjoint Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12691956","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6062669/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPR Full-Waveform Sensitivity and Resolution Analysis Using an FDTD Adjoint Method","sourcePdf":"tgrs-meles-2170078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111482S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6186874","articleId":"6062669","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062670,"authors":[{"name":"Sanbo Pan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","Anyang Normal University, Anyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6180074/6062670/6062670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanbo Pan was born in Anlu, China.

The shifted SVPWM has the same effective vectors and operation time as the traditional SVPWM in all six space sectors, while the sequences of vectors changed according to the load current flow direction. All the switches of a three-phase inverter can be turned on under the zero-voltage switching condition, and only one auxiliary resonance during one PWM switch period of the inverter is required. The aims of the method are to increase the switching frequency of the inverter, reduce the switching frequency of the dc-link resonant circuit, and improve the utility of the dc-link voltage. A set of design rules to generate the shifted SVPWM, as well as its hardware implementation, is described in detail. The synchronization circuit is also discussed. To decrease the time burden of the digital signal processor, a field-programmable gate array is employed to receive the effective vectors and the corresponding time and generates the shifted SVPWM drive signals.

We propose following methods: symmetric image downscaling, classifier sharing, and cascade merging, to achieve the desired processing speed and area efficiency. First, an image pyramid with 16 levels is generated from the input image to simultaneously detect faces with different scales. The downscaled images are then transferred to the first stage of the cascade that is shared between the corresponding image pairs based on the pixel validity of the symmetric image pyramid. The last method exploits the different hit ratios of the cascade stages. We use a tree-structured cascade of classifiers since most of the nonface elements are eliminated during the early stages of the classifier. The use of a synthesis tool confirms that the proposed design reduces resource utilization by one-eighth without accuracy loss, compared to the fully parallelized implementation of the same algorithm. We implemented the proposed hardware architecture on a Xilinx Virtex-5 LX330 FPGA. The indicative throughput is 307 frames/s irrespective of the number of faces in the scene for standard VGA (640 \u00d7 480) images with an operating frequency of 125.59 MHz. We may ensure that face detection results are generated at each clock cycle after the initial pipeline delay, using this fully pipelined datapath for tree-structured cascade classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2173943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6133473/06062672.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2173943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Pipelined Datapath for High-Speed Face Detection Using FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Pipelined Datapath for High-Speed Face Detection Using FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062672/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12486967","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Pipelined Datapath for High-Speed Face Detection Using FPGA","sourcePdf":"tii-jeon-2173943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063155S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6133473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6133473","articleId":"6062672","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062674,"authors":[{"name":"Ren C.

The wide application spectrum of MFI in mechatronics includes the industrial automation, the development of intelligent robots, military applications, biomedical applications, etc. In this paper, the architecture and algorithms of MFI are reviewed, and some implementation examples in industrial automation and robotic applications are presented. Furthermore, sensor fusion methods at different levels, namely, estimation methods, classification methods and inference methods, the most frequently used algorithms in previous researches with their advantages and limitations are summarized. Applications of MFI in robotics and mechatronics are discussed.

This paper presents an application-oriented service share model for the generalization of vision processing. Based on the model, a vision system architecture is presented that can readily integrate computer vision processing and make application modules share services and exchange messages transparently. The architecture provides a standard interface for loading various modules and a mechanism for modules to acquire inputs and publish processing results that can be used as inputs by others. Using this architecture, a system can load specific applications without considering the common low-layer data processing. We have implemented a prototype vision system based on the proposed architecture. The latency performance and 3-D track function were tested with the prototype system.

Track irregularities are the main causes of the vibration of high-speed trains and thus should be carefully monitored to maintain the stability and ride quality of the trains. A mixed filtering approach is proposed for stable displacement estimation and waveband classification of the irregularities in the measured acceleration. Accelerometers are mounted on the axle box and the bogie of a high-speed train to measure the acceleration in the lateral and vertical directions. The estimated results are compared with those of a commercial track geometry measurement system. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach and the relationship between the mounted location of the accelerometers and the estimated track irregularities are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6145766/06062677.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2170377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2170377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed Filtering Approach for Track Condition Monitoring Using Accelerometers on the Axle Box and Bogie","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Tracking","Accelerometers","Measurement by laser beam","Displacement measurement","Axles","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","computerised instrumentation","condition monitoring","filtering theory","geometry","mechanical stability","railway rolling stock","rapid transit systems","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed filtering approach","track condition monitoring","accelerometers","axle box","axle bogie","railway track irregularity estimation method","high-speed train vibration","waveband classification","commercial track geometry measurement system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerometer","axle box","bogie","high-speed train","mixed filtering","track condition monitoring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed Filtering Approach for Track Condition Monitoring Using Accelerometers on the Axle Box and Bogie","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6062677/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524365","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed Filtering Approach for Track Condition Monitoring Using Accelerometers on the Axle Box and Bogie","sourcePdf":"tim-lee-2170377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063921S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6145766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6145766","articleId":"6062677","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6062679,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-He Zhang","affiliation":["CASKey Laboratory of Health Informatics and the CAS-SIAT-Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, CAS, Shenzhen, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Graduate, University of CAS, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/6145490/6062679/6062679-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guang-He Zhang received the M.E. degree from Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China, in 2008.

To minimize resource consumption, utilizing information already available to a WBSN, particularly common to different sensor nodes of a WBSN, for security purposes becomes an attractive solution. In this paper, we tested the randomness and distinctiveness of the 128-bit biometric binary sequences (BSs) generated from interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 20 healthy subjects as well as 30 patients suffered from myocardial infarction and 34 subjects with other cardiovascular diseases. The encoding time of a biometric BS on a WBSN node is on average 23 ms and memory occupation is 204 bytes for any given IPI sequence. The results from five U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology statistical tests suggest that random biometric BSs can be generated from both healthy subjects and cardiovascular patients and can potentially be used as authentication identifiers for securing WBSNs. Ultimately, it is preferred that these biometric BSs can be used as encryption keys such that key distribution over the WBSN can be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2011.2173946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","startPage":"176","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2011.2173946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145490","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6145490/06062679.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","NIST","Entropy","Myocardium","Security","Electrocardiography","Random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","body sensor networks","encoding","statistical testing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometric random binary sequences","securing wireless body sensor networks","m-health","myocardial infarction","cardiovascular diseases","encoding time","statistical tests","authentication identifiers","encryption keys","word length 128 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","body sensor networks","cardiovascular health informatics","random number generation","security","wearable sensors"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Cardiovascular Diseases","Case-Control Studies","Clothing","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Remote Sensing Technology","Remote Sensing Technology","Remote Sensing Technology","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Using Interpulse Intervals to Generate 128-Bit Biometric Random Binary Sequences for Securing Wireless Body Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062679/","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6062679/","accessionNumber":"12509348","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"22049370","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Using Interpulse Intervals to Generate 128-Bit Biometric Random Binary Sequences for Securing Wireless Body Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"titb-zhang-2173946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061579S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6145490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6145490","articleId":"6062679","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6062681,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Rasterized simulations are popular but they are tainted by an aliasing component that impacts the assessment of the performance of reconstruction. We introduce analytical simulation tools that are suited to parallel magnetic resonance imaging and allow one to build realistic phantoms. The proposed phantoms are composed of ellipses and regions with piecewise-polynomial boundaries, including spline contours, B\u00e9zier contours, and polygons. In addition, they take the channel sensitivity into account, for which we investigate two possible models. Our analytical formulations provide well-defined data in both the spatial and k-space domains. Our main contribution is the closed-form determination of the Fourier transforms that are involved. Experiments validate the proposed implementation. In a typical parallel magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction experiment, we quantify the bias in the overly optimistic results obtained with rasterized simulations-the inverse-crime situation. We provide a package that implements the different simulations and provide tools to guide the design of realistic phantoms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6159236/06062681.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2174158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2174158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic Analytical Phantoms for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phantoms","Sensitivity","Magnetic resonance imaging","Polynomials","Analytical models","Coils","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","medical image processing","phantoms","piecewise polynomial techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic analytical phantoms","quantitative validation","reconstruction algorithms","rasterized simulations","aliasing component","analytical simulation tools","ellipses","piecewise-polynomial boundaries","spline contours","B\u00e9zier contours","polygons","channel sensitivity","Fourier transforms","parallel magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction experiment","inverse-crime situation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier analytical simulation","inverse crime","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Shepp\u2013Logan"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Computer Simulation","Fourier Analysis","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Models, Biological","Phantoms, Imaging","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Realistic Analytical Phantoms for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571178","pubMedId":"22049364","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Realistic Analytical Phantoms for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-guerquinkern-2174158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035919S","chronDate":"March  2012","isNumber":"6159236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"101","articleId":"6062681","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6062683,"authors":[{"name":"Rafa\u0142 Dlugosz","affiliation":["Electronics and Signal Processing Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland","Mars Society Polska, Space Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland","Faculty of Telecommunication and Electrical Engineering, University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6062683/6062683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafa\u0142 D\u0142ugosz received the M.Sc. degree in control and robotics and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications (with distinctions) from the Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144, Poland, in 1996 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently with the University of Technology and Live Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland.

In a medium sized map with several hundreds neurons implemented in the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor 0.18 \u03bcm technology, all neurons start adapting the weights after no more than 11 ns. The adaptation is then carried out in parallel. This is an evident advantage in comparison with the commonly used software-realized SOMs. The circuit is robust against the process, supply voltage and environment temperature variations. Due to a simple structure, it features low energy consumption of a few pJ per neuron per a single learning pattern. In this paper, we discuss different aspects of hardware realization, such as a suitable selection of the map topology and the initial neighborhood range, as the optimization of these parameters is essential when looking from the circuit complexity point of view. For the optimal values of these parameters, the chip area and the power dissipation can be reduced even by 60% and 80%, respectively, without affecting the quality of learning.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2169809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06062683.pdf","startPage":"2091","endPage":"2104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2169809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Programmable Asynchronous Neighborhood Mechanism for Kohonen SOM Implemented in CMOS Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062683/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Programmable Asynchronous Neighborhood Mechanism for Kohonen SOM Implemented in CMOS Technology","volume":"22","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409296","pubMedId":"22049367","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062683/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Programmable Asynchronous Neighborhood Mechanism for Kohonen SOM Implemented in CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"tnn-dlugosz-pt1-2169809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07304S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6062683","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6062693,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos E.

Performing Bayesian inference based on the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, a new low-complexity iterative method is derived, and its connection with Gibbs sampling and variational Bayesian inference is highlighted.

Assuming that the path delays are known, a novel iterative pilot-aided algorithm for joint estimation of the multipath Rayleigh channel complex gains (CG) and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) is introduced. Each CG time-variation, within one OFDM symbol, is approximated by a basis expansion model (BEM) representation. An autoregressive (AR) model is built to statistically characterize the variations of the BEM coefficients across the OFDM blocks. In addition to the algorithm, the derivation of the hybrid Cramer-Rao bound (HCRB) for CFO and CGs estimation in our context of very high mobility is provided. We show that the proposed EM has a lower computational complexity than the optimum maximum a posteriori estimator and yet incurs only an insignificant loss in performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06062694.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems via the EM Algorithm in the Presence of Very High Mobility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Delay","Estimation","Joints","Vectors","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","channel estimation","communication complexity","expectation-maximisation algorithm","frequency estimation","mobility management (mobile radio)","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint carrier frequency offset","channel estimation","OFDM systems","EM algorithm","very high mobility","CFO","time-varying frequency-selective channel","expectation-maximization algorithm","parametric channel model","path delays","iterative pilot-aided algorithm","joint estimation","multipath Rayleigh channel complex gains","CG time-variation","OFDM symbol","basis expansion model representation","BEM representation","autoregressive model","AR model","BEM coefficients","OFDM blocks","hybrid Cramer-Rao bound","HCRB","computational complexity","optimum maximum a posteriori estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","time-varying channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems via the EM Algorithm in the Presence of Very High Mobility","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471552","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems via the EM Algorithm in the Presence of Very High Mobility","sourcePdf":"tsp-simon-2174053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050883S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"73","articleId":"6062694","onlineDate":"28 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6062708,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Attig","affiliation":["Xilinx Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Attig","id":"37265776000"},{"name":"Gordon Brebner","affiliation":["Xilinx Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Brebner","id":"37265701500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1454-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4521-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062708","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":750},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062708","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Protocols","Throughput","Program processors","Pipelines","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level languages","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable packet parsing","field programmable gate array","packet classification function","packet security function","high-level programmability","PP high-level language","Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-speed packet processing","FPGA-based parallel processing","Domain-specific languages and compilers"]}],"abstract":"Packet parsing is necessary at all points in the modern networking infrastructure, to support packet classification and security functions, as well as for protocol implementation. Increasingly high line rates call for advanced hardware packet processing solutions, while increasing rates of change call for high-level programmability of these solutions. This paper presents an approach for harnessing modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices, which are a natural technology for implementing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing. The paper introduces PP: a simple high-level language for describing packet parsing algorithms in an implementation-independent manner. It demonstrates that this language can be compiled to give high-speed FPGA-based packet parsers that can be integrated alongside other packet processing components to build network nodes. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to specific packet parsing requirements. Scalability of these architectures allows parsing at line rates from 1 to 400 Gb/s as required in different network contexts. Run-time programmability of these architectures allows dynamic updating of parsing algorithms during operation in the field. Implementation results show that programmable packet parsing of 600 million small packets per second can be supported on a single Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA device handling a 400 Gb/s line rate.","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2011.12","publicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062615/6062696/06062708.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2011.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"400 Gb/s Programmable Packet Parsing on a Single FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"400 Gb/s Programmable Packet Parsing on a Single FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062708/","accessionNumber":"12343317","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"400 Gb/s Programmable Packet Parsing on a Single FPGA","confLoc":"Brooklyn, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4521a012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098929S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062615","isNumber":"6062696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062615","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6062696","articleId":"6062708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6062709,"authors":[{"name":"Kunyang Peng","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, China"],"firstName":"Kunyang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37711234600"},{"name":"Siyuan Tang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Siyuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"38018534300"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716808500"},{"name":"Qunfeng Dong","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Qunfeng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37302766200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1454-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4521-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062709","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":432},"abstract":"Regular expression matching is the core engine of many network functions such as intrusion detection, protocol analysis and so on. In spite of intensive research, we are still in need of a method for fast and scalable regular expression matching, where it takes one simple memory lookup to match each input character (like DFA) and storage space growing linearly with regular expression pattern set size (like NFA). Most recently, TCAM-based DFA implementation has been proposed as a promising approach, for TCAM's unique parallel and wildcard matching capabilities. However, the number of TCAM entries needed is still above exponentially growing DFA size and hence not scalable. In this paper, we propose a chain-based DFA deflation method for fast and scalable regular expression matching using TCAM, which takes one simple TCAM lookup to match each input character and effectively deflates DFA size. Experiments based on real life pattern sets demonstrate that, the number of TCAM entries used by our DFA deflation method is up to two orders of magnitude lower than the DFA size, and comes quite close to the linearly growing NFA size. This not only means superior scalability, but also allows us to implement regular expression matching at extremely fast matching speed, up to two orders of magnitude faster than the existing TCAM-based DFA implementation method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062615/6062696/06062709.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2011.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2011.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chain-Based DFA Deflation for Fast and Scalable Regular Expression Matching Using TCAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Encoding","Pattern matching","Random access memory","Impedance matching","Educational institutions","Merging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network reliability","computer network security","content-addressable storage","finite automata","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chain-based DFA deflation","regular expression matching","intrusion detection","protocol analysis","simple memory lookup","NFA","deterministic finite automation","nondeterministic finite automation","ternary content addressable memory","TCAM-based DFA implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regular Expression Matching","Deep Packet Inspection","DFA","TCAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Chain-Based DFA Deflation for Fast and Scalable Regular Expression Matching Using TCAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062709/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343318","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chain-Based DFA Deflation for Fast and Scalable Regular Expression Matching Using TCAM","confLoc":"Brooklyn, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4521a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072582S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062615","isNumber":"6062696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062615","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6062696","articleId":"6062709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6062716,"authors":[{"name":"Xingkui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing TechnologY, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xingkui","lastName":"Liu","id":"38025910800"},{"name":"Xinchun Liu","affiliation":["Sugon Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinchun","lastName":"Liu","id":"38025910900"},{"name":"Ninghui Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Computing TechnologY, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ninghui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37287666000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1454-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4521-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062716","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"Regular expression (Reg Ex) matching plays an important role in many modern intrusion detection systems (IDS). DFA is an effective way to perform regular expression matching. However, the prohibitive memory requirement makes DFAs impractical for many real world rule sets. In this paper we propose a method to dramatically reduce the DFA memory usage and still provide guaranteed matching speed. A small table for each state is employed to help translate the input character into the offset of the modified transition table for the same state. The proposed representation for DFAs is called character substitution DFA (CSDFA). We present experimental results using rule sets from both L7-filter and Snort.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062615/6062696/06062716.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2011.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2011.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Compact Regular Expression Matching Using Character Substitution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Merging","Inspection","Memory management","Computers","Arrays","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic automata","finite automata","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular expression matching","intrusion detection systems","prohibitive memory requirement","DFA memory usage","transition table","character substitution DFA","L7-filter","Snort","deterministic finite automata"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regular expressions","DFA","deep packet inspection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Compact Regular Expression Matching Using Character Substitution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062716/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343325","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Compact Regular Expression Matching Using Character Substitution","confLoc":"Brooklyn, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4521a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037247S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062615","isNumber":"6062696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062615","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6062696","articleId":"6062716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6062727,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Unnikrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Unnikrishnan","id":"38014822900"},{"name":"Justin Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Lu","id":"38024405200"},{"name":"Lixin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37274359500"},{"name":"Russell Tessier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Tessier","id":"37272879000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1454-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4521-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062727","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Programming","Hardware design languages","Computer architecture","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","field programmable gate arrays","software reusability","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ReClick","modular dataplane design framework","shared network infrastructures","field programmable gate arrays","high performance network virtualization","user-friendly programming models","reconfigurable data plane design","reconfigurable data plane deployment","FPGA-based network virtualization systems","hardware-agnostic programming model","virtual data plane semantics","Click software router development framework","software reuse","Net FPGA platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Virtualization","FPGA","Programming models","Click modular router","NetFPGA"]}],"abstract":"Network virtualization has emerged as a powerful technique to deploy novel services and experimental protocols over shared network infrastructures. Although recent research has highlighted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as attractive platforms for high performance network virtualization, these devices remain inaccessible to the larger networking research community due to the absence of user-friendly programming models. A programming model that can abstract the intricacies of the hardware platform while being aware of the underlying resource constraints is highly desirable. In this paper, we present ReClick, a framework to efficiently design and deploy reconfigurable data planes for FPGA-based network virtualization systems. A hardware-agnostic programming model is described that allows developers to focus on the virtual data plane semantics rather than the implementation details. The framework exposes interfaces similar to the popular software router development framework, Click, and promotes design reuse. Optimization strategies are included in ReClick which use similarities between virtual data plane configurations to implement multiple planes in an area-efficient manner. Data planes exhibiting up to 1 Gbps data rate have been automatically compiled and tested in hardware in a Net FPGA platform.","publicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 ACM/IEEE Seventh Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062615/6062696/06062727.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ReClick - A Modular Dataplane Design Framework for FPGA-Based Network Virtualization","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2011.31","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"ReClick - A Modular Dataplane Design Framework for FPGA-Based Network Virtualization","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343336","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062727/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ReClick - A Modular Dataplane Design Framework for FPGA-Based Network Virtualization","confLoc":"Brooklyn, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4521a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112286S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062615","isNumber":"6062696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062615","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6062696","articleId":"6062727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6062770,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37709698200"},{"name":"Xiangxu Meng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xiangxu","lastName":"Meng","id":"37280113500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1079-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel BVH tracing method on GPU, which can achieve better SIMD utilization than traditional method. In the traditional way, thread usually sticks to a ray until the closest hit is found. When the threads of the same warp follow very divergent ray paths, SIMD utilization drops significantly. The idea of our method is to redefine the way of work distribution by binding the ray and the data to be tested together, in order to spread the computation of the single ray to multi threads. We also separate the tracing process into three steps to collect the work units of the same type and process them in a stream-like manner. The first step is ray traversal whose task is to do ray-box testing for the ray-node pairs. Its output is an stack of ray-triangle pairs, which is then fed to intersecting step to form an stack of ray-hit pairs. The last step is to use ray-hit pairs to update the closest hits for each ray of the same warp. The experiment shows our method can efficiently improve the SIMD utilization and result in less tracing time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062616/6062747/06062770.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/CAD/Graphics.2011.70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAD/Graphics.2011.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIMD Friendly Ray Tracing on GPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Indexes","Kernel","Ray tracing","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","parallel processing","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIMD friendly ray tracing","GPU","BVH tracing method","SIMD utilization","ray-box testing","ray-node pairs","ray-triangle pairs","ray-hit pairs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","Ray tracing","Rendering","BVH"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SIMD Friendly Ray Tracing on GPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062770/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343367","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIMD Friendly Ray Tracing on GPU","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"4497a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057981S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062616","isNumber":"6062747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062616","xplore-issue":"6062747","articleId":"6062770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6062859,"authors":[{"name":"Guangming Cao","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Department of Integrated Electronics, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Cao","id":"38021027400"},{"name":"Fengqi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Integrated Electronics, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Fengqi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404830100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0974-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062859","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"abstract":"One of the most important issues in large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is how to balance the energy consumption of sensor nodes.

We discuss GAs from an architectural perspective, offering a general analysis of GAs on multi-core CPUs and on GPUs, with solution quality considered. We describe widely-used parallel GA schemes based on Master-Slave, Island and Cellular models. Then, based on the multi-core and many-core architectures, especially the thread organization, memory hierarchy, and core utilization, we analyze the execution speed and solution quality of different GA schemes theoretically. Finally, we can point to the best approach to use on multi-core and many-core systems to execute GAs, so that we can obtain the highest quality solution at a cost of the shortest execution time. Furthermore, there are three extra contributions. Firstly, during our analysis and evaluation, we not only focus on the execution speed of different schemes, but also take the solution quality into account, so that our findings will be more useful in practice. Secondly, during our optimization of an Island scheme on GPUs, we find that the GPU architecture actually alters the scheme, making it become the Cellular scheme, which leads to big changes in solution quality and optimization results. Finally, we calculate the GPU speedup based on a comparison between the best scheme on a GPU and the best one on a CPU, rather than between an optimized one on the GPU and the worst one on a CPU, so that the speedup we calculate is more reasonable and a better guide to practical decisions.","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2011.65","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062561/6062794/06062894.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"334","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"2011 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2011.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture-based Performance Evaluation of Genetic Algorithms on Multi/Many-core Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Architecture-based Performance Evaluation of Genetic Algorithms on Multi/Many-core Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12343056","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062894/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture-based Performance Evaluation of Genetic Algorithms on Multi/Many-core Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4477a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174695S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062561","isNumber":"6062794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062561","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6062794","articleId":"6062894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6062903,"authors":[{"name":"Shihan Li","affiliation":["Aviation Meteorology Institute, Equipment Academy of Air Force, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shihan","lastName":"Li","id":"37715561300"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Aviation Meteorology Institute, Equipment Academy of Air Force, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38021401000"},{"name":"Depei Qian","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Depei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37289498500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0974-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062903","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"A novel deployment oriented role destined integrated protocol called DOP is presented for event-driven wireless sensor networks.

Our heuristic algorithm is simple, efficient, and based on simulated annealing.","doi":"10.1109/CSE.2011.78","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"2011 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2011.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062794","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062561/6062794/06062908.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Resource Allocation and Scheduling with Precedence Constraints in the GLECLUBS/eGLECLUBS Pipelines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062908/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Resource Allocation and Scheduling with Precedence Constraints in the GLECLUBS/eGLECLUBS Pipelines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6062908/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12343070","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Resource Allocation and Scheduling with Precedence Constraints in the GLECLUBS/eGLECLUBS Pipelines","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4477a421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114632S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062561","isNumber":"6062794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062561","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6062794","articleId":"6062908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6062916,"authors":[{"name":"Yongming Qin","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Qin","id":"38024424300"},{"name":"Qiuling Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Qiuling","lastName":"Tang","id":"37301101900"},{"name":"Ye Liang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Liang","id":"37401146300"},{"name":"Xiuyu Yue","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Xiuyu","lastName":"Yue","id":"38031098900"},{"name":"Xian Li","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Li","id":"38026160700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0974-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062916","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Energy consumption","Protocols","Data communication","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","protocols","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient cooperative MIMO scheme","wireless sensor networks","WSN","energy-efficient LEACH protocol","EE-LEACH protocol","EE-LEACH-MIMO scheme","cluster heads","cooperative nodes","network load","network lifetime"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WSNs","LEACH","cooperative MIMO","energy-efficient","network lifetime"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency is the most important design goal for wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

Various mathematical models have been developed in the past to improve the quality of random numbers. It can be construed that in general to obtain random numbers of excellent quality, a complex mathematical model has to be used which can be a performance bottleneck. In this work, we propose a novel technique to implement a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) using sources of uncertainty found within Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) together with histogram equalization to obtain maximum entropy. We evaluate the random numbers generated by our approach using four tests. First, we measure the correlation values between two sequences of random numbers, second, we measure the entropy values, third, we use watermarking, an application used in network security and finally we use Monte Carlo analysis for pi-value calculation. Based on these quality measurements, our method has achieved better results than popular random number generators compared in this work.

With real time sampling and equivalent time sampling, the embedded system could perform rapid and effective measurement for the periodic signal which is either fast-varying or slow-varying and also be able to take real time sampling to the single-shot signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2011.34","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062562/6062959/06062993.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"201","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2011.34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent Sampling Oscilloscope with External Delay Embedded System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent Sampling Oscilloscope with External Delay Embedded System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343135","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062993/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent Sampling Oscilloscope with External Delay Embedded System","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4538a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093903S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062562","isNumber":"6062959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062562","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6062959","articleId":"6062993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6062998,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Mohamed","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37305018000"},{"name":"Jameela Al-Jaroodi","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Jameela","lastName":"Al-Jaroodi","id":"38350711800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1564-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6062998","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Load management","Radiation detectors","Monitoring","Delay","Load modeling","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-tolerant dynamic load balancing","distributed systems","communication delay","dynamic load behaviors","rescheduling purposes","replicated FTP servers","parallel applications","multiple independent distributed servers","dual direction operations","parallel/distributed application","nondedicated heterogeneous distributed environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Grid computing","heterogeneous systems","load balancing","delay-tolerant systems"]}],"abstract":"Several approaches for load balancing in distributed systems were introduced, however, most of them require prior knowledge of the environments operation conditions and/or constant monitoring of these conditions at run time. That allows the applications to adjust the load and redistribute the tasks when necessary. These techniques were designed with the assumption that there is no high communication delay in discovering dynamic load behaviors for the rescheduling purposes. This paper proposes a new delay-tolerant dynamic load balancing technique that can be used effectively for reducing the execution time of some distributed tasks while minimizing the control overhead. Such tasks include downloading large files from replicated FTP servers and executing parallel applications on multiple independent distributed servers. This technique we call DDOps (Dual Direction Operations) allows the parallel/distributed application to make use of available resources efficiently while not requiring any significant control overhead. In our approach, load balancing is automatically inherent from the technique. Since the tasks are handled from opposite directions, processing will continue until the workers meet at some point which indicates all tasks are done. Thus DDOps is most suitable for non-dedicated heterogeneous distributed environments where resources vary in specifications, locations, and operating conditions. The experimental results in file download and parallel computations all show how efficient DDOps is and how well it balances the load among the different tasks.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2011.39","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062562/6062959/06062998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2011.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062959","startPage":"237","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Tolerant Dynamic Load Balancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6062998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Tolerant Dynamic Load Balancing","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6062998/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343140","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6062998/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Tolerant Dynamic Load Balancing","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4538a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085584S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062562","isNumber":"6062959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062562","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6062959","articleId":"6062998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6063011,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Gu","id":"37399837700"},{"name":"Qishi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Qishi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290357300"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Computational Science Center, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292952100"},{"name":"Dantong Yu","affiliation":["Computational Science Center, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dantong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37276390400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1564-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6063011","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063011","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Throughput","Computer network reliability","Optimization","Approximation methods","Complexity theory","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","data handling","fault tolerant computing","natural sciences computing","optimisation","software reliability","wide area networks","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed scientific workflow","streaming data processing","next-generation scientific application","workflow-based computing technology","large-scale distributed data processing","faulty network","probabilistic failure","biobjective optimization problem","decentralized layer-oriented method","data flow","failure rate bound","wide-area network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","fault tolerance","workflow mapping","frame rate","distributed computing"]}],"abstract":"With the advent of next-generation scientific applications, the workflow-based computing technology has become an indispensable research method for managing and streamlining large-scale distributed data processing.

On top of this infrastructure, we have developed analysis techniques for online detection of a wide variety of \"hard\" and \"soft\" types of failures.

PAC Duo SOC is a heterogeneous multi-processor SOC composed of one ARM926 core serving as the general purpose processor (GPP) and two ITRI PAC DSP cores serving as the special purpose processors (SPP). We ported Linux operating system to run on the ARM926 processor and ported the real-time kernel Micro-C/OS-II to run on one PAC DSP core, leaving the other PAC DSP core with the option of running either another Micro-C/OS-II or a different kernel. To address the issues in IPC, a high performance message-passing mechanism is developed.

In a heterogeneous distributed computing environment, computing nodes and communication link failures are inevitable and could have an negative impact on the applications. Efficient mapping and scheduling algorithms to achieve both the low end-to-end delay and the high reliability have been attracting active research interests. However, it is not possible to optimize both objectives due to conflicting requirements. We proposed a mapping and scheduling algorithm, namely Fault-tolerant Workflow Mapping Algorithm under End-to-end Delay Constraint (FMEDC), which considers both the execution delay and reliability in a two-step procedure. In the first step, a hybrid mapping algorithm combining recursive critical path searching and layer-based priority techniques (HCPT) is developed to achieve the minimum end-to-end delay(MED) along the critical path. The computation and communication failure rates are factored into equation to compute the reliability-enhanced execution time. In the second step, the modules on the non-critical paths are rescheduled onto nodes in a way such that system reliability can be improved under the MED constraint calculated in the first step. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the lowest MED but highest reliability under the same time constraints compared with some representative algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2011.81","startPage":"575","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062562/6062959/06063042.pdf","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2011.81","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063042/","displayDocTitle":"A Fault-Tolerant Workflow Mapping Algorithm under End-to-End Delay Constraint","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063042/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12343184","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault-Tolerant Workflow Mapping Algorithm under End-to-End Delay Constraint","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4538a575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07455S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062562","isNumber":"6062959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062562","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6062959","articleId":"6063042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6063053,"authors":[{"name":"Dongmin Choi","affiliation":["Department of computer engineering, Chosun university, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongmin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405495500"},{"name":"Ilyong Chung","affiliation":["Department of computer engineering, Chosun university, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ilyong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37275921700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1564-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6063053","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Repeaters","Energy consumption","Accuracy","Sensors","Redundancy","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware event-driven regional clustering scheme","Ed-RCS","wireless sensor networks","data redundancy","sensor coverage duplication","node sensor coverage","hop by hop transmission","energy holes","link failure problems","data loss","node link disconnections","transmission efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","data redundancy","energy-hole problem","regional cluster"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ed-RCS: An Energy-Aware Event-Driven Regional Clustering Scheme for WSNs","abstract":"Data redundancy is occurs for two reasons: one is sensor coverage duplication and the other one is sensor event.

The HDCF platform differs from the existing vertical supply chain federation (VSCF) models in terms of establishing federation and dynamic pricing. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity yet can be easily implemented and used to solve distributed resource allocation problem in HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic solution to this problem that ensures mutual benefits so that the cloud providers (CPs) are encouraged to form a HDCF platform. We study two resource allocation games - cooperative and non-cooperative games to analyze interaction among CPs in a HDCF environment. Also both centralized and distributed algorithms are presented to find optimal solutions which have low overhead and robust performance. Various simulations were carried out to validate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation games.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062562/6062959/06063082.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"827","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2011.116","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2011.116","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Biological system modeling","Quality of service","Production","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cooperative systems","distributed algorithms","game theory","pricing","resource allocation","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation game","horizontal dynamic cloud federation platform","HDCF platform","vertical supply chain federation model","VSCF model","dynamic pricing","game-theoretic solution","cloud provider","cooperative game","distributed algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Horizontal cloud federation","vertical cloud federation","resource allocation","cooperative game","non-cooperative game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063082/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation Games in Horizontal Dynamic Cloud Federation Platform","accessionNumber":"12343223","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063082/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation Games in Horizontal Dynamic Cloud Federation Platform","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4538a822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057869S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062562","isNumber":"6062959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062562","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6062959","articleId":"6063082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6063085,"authors":[{"name":"Joey Ingram","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Joey","lastName":"Ingram","id":"38022473500"},{"name":"Mengxia Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Mengxia","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37291634600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1564-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6063085","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Correlation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Symmetric matrices","Instruction sets","Computer architecture","Loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","data analysis","genomics","inference mechanisms","matrix algebra","parallel architectures","parallel machines","programmable logic arrays","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU accelerated microarray data analysis","random matrix theory","high-throughput genomic technology","gene expression data","colossal data size","inference mechanism","transcription networks","graphical processing units","general purpose computing","programmable parallel processor","CPU","automated microarray data analysis","remote high performance computing facility","LAPACK routine","Pearson correlation matrix"]}],"abstract":"Recent advances in high-throughput genomic technology, such as micro arrays, usually produce vast amounts of gene expression data under many experimental conditions. Analyzing such data is often difficult due to the colossal data size and the intensive computing involved. In addition, many existing analysis tools often require the inference of experienced analysts and subjective judgments. In this paper, we developed a parallel approach based on Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to generate transcription networks using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Recently, GPUs have been redesigned into a more unified architecture, which has allowed them to be used more readily in general purpose computing. This architectural advancement has resulted in GPUs becoming easily programmable parallel processors with performance that is vastly superior to CPUs. Our GPU-based approach makes automated micro array data analysis faster, more accurate and noise resistant without engaging remote high performance computing facilities, such as a cluster or supercomputer. The implementation moves some computationally intensive tasks, such as the calculations of Pearson correlation coefficients, tridiagonal reduction, back transformation of eigenvectors, and orthogonal rotation, to the GPU. Experimental results on real micro array datasets show that our GPU implementation runs faster than a CPU version using highly optimized LAPACK routines. The runtime speedup gets higher as the number of genes and sample points in a micro array dataset increases.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2011.119","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062562/6062959/06063085.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2011.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU Accelerated Microarray Data Analysis Using Random Matrix Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063085/","displayDocTitle":"GPU Accelerated Microarray Data Analysis Using Random Matrix Theory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343226","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063085/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU Accelerated Microarray Data Analysis Using Random Matrix Theory","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4538a839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059817S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062562","isNumber":"6062959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062562","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6062959","articleId":"6063085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6063107,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Hang-sheng","affiliation":["Nanjing Telecommunication Technology Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Hang-sheng","id":"38272299500"},{"name":"Wang Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37596259200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1564-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6063107","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Throughput","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Interference","Ad hoc networks","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","quality of service","radio access networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS","cognitive radio networks","single-channel opportunistic spectrum access strategy","minimum rate gap-based access strategy","MRG-CPA","PR","primary radios","power allocation algorithm","MAC protocol","FFD","BFD","minimum rate based channel","CRN network"]}],"abstract":"Considering the scenario of cognitive radio network (CRN) single channel opportunistic spectrum access, the minimum rate gap-based access strategy (MRG-CPA) is established which provides CR QoS guarantee and also promises interference-free to primary radios (PRs).

The determination of mutation rate and the selection of mutation type are two important issues for evolution, and they have a crucial impact on the performance of ENN. In order to improve the convergence speed and classification accuracy of ENN, a heuristic mutation operator (HMO), which evolves connection weights and network structure simultaneously, was proposed.

Furthermore, the user interaction with the computer system is adapted to the requirements in a kitchen. On the work flow side, MAMPF converts a recipe into a task tree which is used to guide the user through the cooking process. By knowing the recipe, based on a formal description specially developed for this system, the optimal sequence of actions can be calculated. The system is designed to support the user without limiting spontaneity or creativity and can - if necessary - be used just like any usual stove. Consequentially, the user always retains control over the system, all settings can be overwritten at any point, and the order of the tasks can be dynamically rearranged. In order to prove the correctness of this concept, a prototype has been implemented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IE.2011.18","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Environments","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062619/6063345/06063382.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"178","doi":"10.1109/IE.2011.18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAMPF: An Intelligent Cooking Agent for Zoneless Stoves","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"MAMPF: An Intelligent Cooking Agent for Zoneless Stoves","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12343619","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAMPF: An Intelligent Cooking Agent for Zoneless Stoves","confLoc":"Nottingham, UK","sourcePdf":"4452a171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071497S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062619","isNumber":"6063345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062619","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6063345","articleId":"6063382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":6063460,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Thanh Hiep","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Pham Thanh","lastName":"Hiep","id":"37590101400"},{"name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","affiliation":["Le Quy Don technical University, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Huy","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38021642500"},{"name":"Ryuji Kohno","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuji","lastName":"Kohno","id":"37274904400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1848-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6063460","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel capacity","MIMO","Transceivers","Antennas","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","decode and forward communication","energy conservation","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power conservation","distributed MIMO relay system","channel capacity","propagation environment","transceiver","decode-and-forward scheme","antenna element","dynamic relay selection","transmission rate","transmit power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed relay system","optimizing distance","Optimization antenna element","upper bound of channel capacity","dynamic relay selection"]}],"abstract":"The research on distributed MIMO relay system has been attracting much attention. By optimizing the position of each relay, the channel capacity of such system is larger than that of original MIMO system. However, the propagation environment between each transceiver is simplified to be the same. In this paper, a decode-and-forward scheme distributed MIMO relay system is examined. The distance between each relay is optimized in propagation environment which is brought close to actuality. For upper bound of channel capacity, the number of relay is optimized whether total antenna element is fixed or not. When the number of relay is assumed to be infinite, the dynamic relay selection method based on the transmission rate is proposed.

So, these data must be stored and retrieved in an efficient and effective manner, in order for it to be put to practical use. In this connection, wavelet transform is used for decades as it emerged as a cutting edge technology within the field of image analysis and in computer graphics. Due to the intensive computation of wavelet transform of the image data, the multi-threaded concurrent computing is considered to be a solution. The Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are used effectively to specify the communicating threads in the way where high-level transition systems are used to capture the control flow of the system components and MSCs to describe the non-atomic component interactions. This specification is efficiently amenable to formal verification. We present the way how to specify the communicating threads using MSCs. The compression method and the use of wavelet transform for compression are presented. Moreover, the MSC based specification along with the modified concurrency in the threads for concurrent wavelet transform are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2011.36","publicationTitle":"2011 12th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062614/6063522/06063551.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2011.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063522","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication Among Multiple Threads in the Concurrent Wavelet Transformation for Image Compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication Among Multiple Threads in the Concurrent Wavelet Transformation for Image Compression","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063551/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12343297","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063551/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Among Multiple Threads in the Concurrent Wavelet Transformation for Image Compression","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4475a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.23863S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062614","isNumber":"6063522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062614","xplore-issue":"6063522","articleId":"6063551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6063600,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Usually in RSM the direct axis air gap is kept low to achieve improved performance. Therefore, eccentricity fault detection in RSM becomes vital. Static eccentricity, one of the two types of eccentricity, is present even in a newly manufactured motor. So far not much work has been reported in literature with respect to modeling a salient pole machine under static eccentric condition. In this paper a Modified Winding Function Approach (MWFA) based model is developed and a characteristic frequency corresponding to static eccentric condition is identified.

In a typical vehicle electric system, however, it is difficult to access the AC current or voltage information of the claw-pole alternator, making conventional sequence-component-based fault detectors useless. This paper analyzes the effects of a full-bridge rectifier on the three-phase unbalanced system. A novel stator turn fault detector was proposed using only the alternator output current measurement. The performance of the stator turn-fault detector is demonstrated both by finite-element simulation and by extensive experimental results. The effect of the winding layout on stator turn fault detection is also discussed. Although the fault detector is originally proposed for claw-pole alternators, it is also applicable to most poly-phase AC generators with a DC link rectifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063611/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12344642","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063611/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using only the DC current information to detect stator turn faults in automotive claw-pole alternators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using only the DC current information to detect stator turn faults in automotive claw-pole alternators","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"018SDEMPED2011ID139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.22037S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059239","isNumber":"6063589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059239","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6063589","articleId":"6063611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6063621,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Orkisz","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Krakow, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Michal Orkisz was born in Krak\u00f3w Poland.

Algorithms such as FFT provide values at regular intervals, whose spacing is determined by the length of the acquired signal. If the time-domain signal length does not contain a whole number of periods, the peak position falls between two spectral values. Neither the exact position nor the amplitude are apparent from the spectrum. A method is presented here for computing a correction to both the location and the amplitude of the local maximum in the spectrogram to significantly improve the estimated location and frequency of the peak location. The computational complexity is constant time per peak, thus it can be employed in low computational power and embedded systems. Corrections for signal length and zero-padding are also included. Examples of the application of this method are presented and its accuracy vs. other methods is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063621","startPage":"179","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059239/6063589/06063621.pdf","publicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of peak locations and amplitudes for automated interpretation of spectra","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Determination of peak locations and amplitudes for automated interpretation of spectra","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063621/","accessionNumber":"12344652","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063621/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of peak locations and amplitudes for automated interpretation of spectra","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"028SDEMPED2011ID205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052106S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059239","isNumber":"6063589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059239","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6063589","articleId":"6063621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6063625,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Bruzzese","affiliation":["Department of Astronautic, Electrical and Energetic Engineering, University of Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Claudio Bruzzese (S'05-M'08) received the M.

The state of the art of the literature concerning the analysis of the stray flux around induction machines, in different positions and with different types of search coil, is here reported. Then, the flux probe here used is presented, together with several acquisitions of stray flux in three positions around the motor and with different techniques of signal analysis. These acquisitions are also compared with measurements collected by means of a commercial flux sensor. The final purpose is to find the best combination of position, sampling frequency, filter, etc. which can give the more interesting information about the \u201chealth\u201d condition of the motor.","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059239/6063589/06063648.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a leakage flux measurement system for condition monitoring of electrical drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Coils","Rotors","Circuit faults","Stator windings","Bars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","condition monitoring","electric drives","leakage currents","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage flux measurement system","condition monitoring","electrical drives","flux coil","induction motors","power converters","flux sensor","sampling frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Induction motors","Magnetic flux leakage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Development of a leakage flux measurement system for condition monitoring of electrical drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063648/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344679","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a leakage flux measurement system for condition monitoring of electrical drives","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"055SDEMPED2011ID123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10853S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059239","isNumber":"6063589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059239","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6063589","articleId":"6063648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6063651,"authors":[{"name":"Jongman Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Jongman Hong (S'09) received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree.","In 2009, he worked at Baker Instrument Company \u2015 An SKF Group Company, Fort Collins, CO, on development of condition monitoring tools for electric machines, as a summer intern.

Conventional optimization method requires solving complex nonlinear equations. Moreover, constraints should be selected such that the number of solved equations equals the variables number to obtain a unique solution. The problem becomes complicated as the number of disconnected phases is more than two. Genetic algorithm is used to solve such optimization problem since it does not involve solving nonlinear equations. Comparison between the conventional optimization technique and GA is carried out using finite element analysis which simulates the machine flux corresponding to each optimum solution.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063674","startPage":"529","endPage":"534","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059239/6063589/06063674.pdf","publicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current optimization for an eleven-phase induction machine under fault conditions using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Stators","Magnetic flux","Search problems","Nonlinear equations","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","fault diagnosis","finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current optimization","eleven-phase induction machine","fault conditions","genetic algorithm","GA","magneto-motive force distribution","MMF distribution","nonlinear equations","optimization problem","finite element analysis","machine flux"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-phase machine","genetic algorithm","finite element analysis","fault conditions","phase loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Current optimization for an eleven-phase induction machine under fault conditions using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344705","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current optimization for an eleven-phase induction machine under fault conditions using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"081SDEMPED2011ID232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07633S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059239","isNumber":"6063589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059239","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6063589","articleId":"6063674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6063689,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A novel practical detection and classification method, using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) associated with a neural technique is developed to detect rotor broken bar faults. In this method, only one phase current is used. Following current spectrum study on hundreds of experimental observations, it was established that the mixed eccentricity harmonic f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ecc_mix</sub>\n has the largest amplitude around the fundamental, under different loads and state (healthy or defective). However f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ecc_mix</sub>\n is related to the slip and the mechanical rotational frequency. It becomes obvious that the detection of the rotor broken bars harmonic is made easy. The amplitude of this harmonic and the slip (detection criterion) are used as the neural network inputs. The last provides reliably, its decision on the state of the machine. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063690","startPage":"632","endPage":"637","publicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2011.6063690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063589","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics & Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059239/6063589/06063690.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broken bar fault diagnosis of induction motors using MCSA and neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063690/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Broken bar fault diagnosis of induction motors using MCSA and neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12344721","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broken bar fault diagnosis of induction motors using MCSA and neural network","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"097SDEMPED2011ID174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087259S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059239","isNumber":"6063589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059239","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6063589","articleId":"6063690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6063691,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this study, we use a one-layer, feed-forward, artificial neural network (ANN), trained using the back-propagation algorithm, to model the behavior of a lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery. Then, possible improvements to the neural network model using a multilevel approach are discussed. A neural controller was then developed on the basis of this model to control the battery voltage.

Besides, for the three-phase grid-connected inverter, under the unbalanced grid voltage condition, the injected grid currents will become unbalanced. This paper aims at weakening the effect of the grid voltages on the injected grid currents for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter. The full-feedforward scheme of the grid voltages is investigated in this paper. The full-feedforward function of the grid voltages in the stationary \u03b1-\u03b2 frame for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter is proposed. This full-feedforward function consists of three parts, which is proportional part, derivative part and second derivative part. With the proposed full-feedforward scheme of the grid voltages, approximately zero steady-state error of the injected grid currents at line frequency can be achieved even with proportional-integral (PI) compensators as the injected grid current regulators in the stationary \u03b1-\u03b2 frame. The injected grid current distortion and unbalance caused by the grid voltages are also greatly reduced. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed full-feedforward scheme is verified by the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063754","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","startPage":"96","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A full-feedforward scheme of grid voltages for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A full-feedforward scheme of grid voltages for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063754/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343851","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063754/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A full-feedforward scheme of grid voltages for a three-phase grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0160108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068869S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6063765,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez","id":"37274433700"},{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Busquets-Monge","id":"37265964100"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal S.

Some of them are simple but imply low efficiency compared with more sophisticated method. The short-circuit current is a simple method to achieve the maximum power point based on the fact that the current at the maximum power point is proportional to the short circuit current. Nevertheless, the measurement of the short circuit current implies high waste of energy. In this paper a short circuit current estimator based on a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model of the PV array is proposed looking for overcoming the main disadvantages of the short circuit current method. The short-circuit current could be estimated under any weather condition in real time, without disconnecting the photovoltaic generator andmeasuring it. Simulation in a grid connected system shows attractive features such as high accuracy, and simple design.

Experimental results are presented and interpreted for five prototype converters, converting universal ac input voltage to 400 V dc. The results demonstrate that the phase shifted semi-bridgeless PFC boost converter is ideally suited for automotive level I residential charging applications in North America, where the typical supply is limited to 120 V and 1.44 kVA.

In addition to a neutral point potential in the dc-link, this topology features in each phase a flying phase capacitor. Balancing these four internal converter voltages around their references, while providing fast torque and/or current control for the machine, is an intrinsically challenging control problem. Model predictive direct torque control (MPDTC) is an ideal candidate to address this problem. It is shown in this paper, how MPDTC can be adapted to this new five-level topology. Compared to direct torque control (DTC), the performance results of MPDTC are very promising-for the same switching frequency the harmonic distortions of the stator currents and the torque can be more than halved. At the same time the very fast torque response of DTC is maintained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive direct torque control of a five-level ANPC converter drive system","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063792","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063792.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive direct torque control of a five-level ANPC converter drive system","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063792/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343889","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive direct torque control of a five-level ANPC converter drive system","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0570343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089164S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6063817,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Cao","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37407390900"},{"name":"Xianhao Yu","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"firstName":"Xianhao","lastName":"Yu","id":"38026133800"},{"name":"Xi Lu","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37599118400"},{"name":"Wei Qian","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37398325500"},{"name":"Fang Zheng Peng","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"firstName":"Fang Zheng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37278944800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6063817","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Switches","Stress","Inductance","Zero current switching","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","switched capacitor networks","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-wing multilevel modular capacitor-clamped DC-DC converter","reduced capacitor voltage stress","voltage conversion ratio","capacitor current stress","capacitor number","distributed stray inductance","zero current switching","input current ripple","input capacitor size","power density","power 100 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel","Switched-Capacitor DC-DC","Modular","ZCS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063817","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063817.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A double-wing multilevel modular capacitor-clamped dc-dc converter with reduced capacitor voltage stress","abstract":"This paper presents a double-wing multilevel modular capacitor-clamped (DW-MMCCC) dc-dc converter.

When the conversion ratio is equal to N, the total device and capacitor number of the even conversion ratio DW-MMCCC is 3N-2 and N, which is the same with the corresponding SW-MMCCC. The total device and capacitor number of odd conversion ratio DW-MMCCC is 3N-1 and N+1 respectively. By using the distributed stray inductance existing in the circuit, zero current switching (ZCS) can be achieved for all the switches of DW-MMCCC. And by using multi-phase DW-MMCCC, the input current ripple and input capacitor size can be reduced significantly. Compared with the traditional multilevel dc-dc converter, the power density of DW-MMCCC could be increased by about ten times. A 100 W three-phase 3X-ZCS-DW-MMCCC prototype has been built and tested.

In this paper, a new MV topology using diode rectifier, three-level boost (TLB) and NPC converter has been proposed to further reduce the cost and size. The dc-link maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control scheme has been proposed with which the TLB performs MPPT and balancing of dc-link capacitors and thus provides a greater flexibility for NPC control. The simulation results for 3MW/3000V/53.33Hz non-salient pole PMSG wind energy system validate the proposed topology and control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063819.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6063819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-level boost converter based medium voltage megawatt PMSG wind energy conversion systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Rectifiers","Capacitors","Wind turbines","Wind energy","Reactive power","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","permanent magnet generators","power generation control","rectifying circuits","synchronous generators","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-level boost converter","medium voltage megawatt PMSG wind energy conversion systems","medium voltage back-to-back neutral-point clamped converters","MV BTB NPC converters","wind turbine manufacturers","BTB two-level converters","TLB converter","DC-link maximum power point tracking control scheme","DC-link MPPT control scheme","DC-link capacitors","NPC control","diode rectifier","power 2 MW","power 3 MW","voltage 3000 V","frequency 53.33 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Three-level boost converter based medium voltage megawatt PMSG wind energy conversion systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063819/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343916","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-level boost converter based medium voltage megawatt PMSG wind energy conversion systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0880908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095353S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6063826,"authors":[{"name":"Mickel Budhia","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mickel","lastName":"Budhia","id":"37680612600"},{"name":"Grant A.

The performance of the magnetic couplers that transfer power determines the overall feasibility of a complete system. Single sided flux couplers have a unidirectional flux pattern and can be used under an EV with minimal loss to the (steel) chassis. Circular pads are single sided and the most common topology and these are investigated with consideration of magnetic field leakage guidelines. Following this, a new polarized coupler topology (referred to as a \u201cDouble-D-Quadrature\u201d (DDQ)) is presented.

In this work, power scheduling aspects of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are addressed. The use of electric vehicles (EVs) as demand response resources and unidirectional vehicle-to-grid benefits are investigated. Power draw can be scheduled with the EV charger in control of charging or via control by a utility or an aggregator. Charging cost functions suitable for charger- and utility-controlled power-draw scheduling are presented. Ancillary service levels possible with unidirectional vehicle-to-grid are quantified using different charging scenarios. Impacts of various power-draw schedules and vehicle participation as a demand-response resource on electricity prices are evaluated. These include cost benefits to both owners and load-serving entities. Ideas to encourage vehicle-to-grid participation are discussed.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063856.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"834","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost benefits and vehicle-to-grid regulation services of unidirectional charging of electric vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cost benefits and vehicle-to-grid regulation services of unidirectional charging of electric vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/6063856/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12343953","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost benefits and vehicle-to-grid regulation services of unidirectional charging of electric vehicles","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"1250452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052883S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6063857,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Moghe","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Moghe","id":"37391514500"},{"name":"Frank Kreikebaum","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kreikebaum","id":"37398786800"},{"name":"Jorge E.

The use of single SiC MOSFETs with a 10 kV reverse blocking voltage will lead to an improved lamp and driver efficiency as compared to the use of a number of series Si switches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063901","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063901.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1131","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformer-less current controlled driver for a dielectric barrier discharge lamp using HV silicon carbide (SiC) switching devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transformer-less current controlled driver for a dielectric barrier discharge lamp using HV silicon carbide (SiC) switching devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6063901/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343998","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063901/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformer-less current controlled driver for a dielectric barrier discharge lamp using HV silicon carbide (SiC) switching devices","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"1740172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057619S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6063914,"authors":[{"name":"D. \u010cu\u010dak","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a"],"firstName":"D.","lastName":"\u010cu\u010dak","id":"38667860600"},{"name":"M.

As to date, the use of GaN devices in power converters is still in its infancy, but its widespread application is a near reality. PV converter industry is one of the areas which would greatly benefit from the new GaN technology. The most important requirements for a PV converter, efficiency and cost effectiveness, can both be addressed with improved switching devices. This paper presents a performance comparison of a PV module integrated DC-DC converter based on commercially available GaN and Si power devices. The presented results show that the first generation of GaN devices outperforms the best in class Si devices.

High efficiency of envelope amplifier can be obtained through modulating the supply voltage of the linear regulator. Instead of tracking the envelope, the buck converter has discrete output voltage that corresponding to particular duty cycles which achieve total ripple cancellation. The transient model for minimum time control is explained, and the calculation of transient times that are pre-calculated and inserted into a lookup table is presented.

Due to space constraints a practical solution for UAVs is to employ electric-starter generators (ESG) embedded in gas turbine engines to facilitate electric engine crank, assist the engine to the desired idle speed and generate power to drive the onboard auxiliaries [2]. However, the traditional sensors that provide accurate knowledge of the machine rotor position to facilitate precise control of the ESG cannot be used because of the adverse operating conditions. This paper describes the challenges of embedding and coupling a position sensorless based permanent magnet ESG directly onto a single shaft of a small, low-cost, gas turbine engine. The complete hardware and control architecture was tested on an experimental test rig using a dynamometer to mimic the gas turbine engine. Following the testing in laboratory, the system was commissioned into the gas turbine Small Electric Engine Demonstrator (SEED).

This issue is particularly critical when low carrier-fundamental frequency ratios are used such as in aerospace applications, where high fundamental frequencies exist. A multilevel Active Shunt Filter with a low switching frequency is proposed to mitigate the lowest order carrier frequency terms. However low carrier frequencies lead to reference voltage phase delay and attenuation and can introduce significant baseband harmonics. These effects cannot be hidden by employing multiple modulator converters. In order to overcome these problems, a multi-sampled modulation approach is proposed, which allows duty cycle updating (n-1) times per switching period for each H-bridge of one phase of the n-level converter (rather than only once or twice as in the regularly sampled PWM). The proposed modulation approach was combined with predictive current control in order to enhance the system performance. The control loop performance compared to regularly sampled PWM is experimentally verified by employing a five-level ASF in a 400Hz power network.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6063956","startPage":"1483","endPage":"1488","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06063956.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-sampled carrier-based PWM for multilevel active shunt power filters for aerospace applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-sampled carrier-based PWM for multilevel active shunt power filters for aerospace applications","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6063956/","accessionNumber":"12344053","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6063956/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-sampled carrier-based PWM for multilevel active shunt power filters for aerospace applications","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"2290628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061356S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6063956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6063964,"authors":[{"name":"Tahar Hamiti","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Tahar","lastName":"Hamiti","id":"37658120600"},{"name":"Chris Gerada","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Gerada","id":"37268041400"},{"name":"Michael Rottach","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rottach","id":"38018218000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6063964","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Electromagnetics","Torque","Heat sinks","Magnetic separation","Permanent magnet motors","Heat transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight optimisation","genetic algorithms","combined electromagnetic-thermal cosimulation environment","vertically mounted surface mount permanent magnet synchronous motor","naturally ventilated surface mount permanent magnet synchronous motor","PMSM","parallel computing environment","nonlinear constrained optimisation problem","GA","electromagnetic design parameters","thermal design parameters"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new approach for the design optimisation of a naturally ventilated, vertically mounted surface mount permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).

The ideal stationary charging system requires no input from the user, and places as few restrictions on either parking location, or environmental conditions (i.e. rain or snow) as possible. The success of inductive charging systems is contingent largely on the design of the magnetic coupling components; i.e. the track pad and the pickup. This paper details a new topology for the track pad, consisting of two largely coplanar, partially overlapping coils positioned such that there is no mutual inductance between them. This arrangement prevents interaction of the two coils, and allows the currents within them to be independent in both phase and magnitude. By controlling the phase and magnitude of the two coil currents, the magnetic field can be shaped to assist in power transfer to a pickup underneath an EV.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064008","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064008.pdf","startPage":"1832","endPage":"1838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bipolar primary pad topology for EV stationary charging and highway power by inductive coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064008/","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar primary pad topology for EV stationary charging and highway power by inductive coupling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344105","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064008/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar primary pad topology for EV stationary charging and highway power by inductive coupling","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"2810358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04584S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6064010,"authors":[{"name":"Di Yao","affiliation":["Maxim Integrated Products, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Yao","id":"37531222400"},{"name":"Christopher G.

Transformer (SST) application [1]. The dc-dc stage of the SST application requires a compact high performance resonant transformer that operates under high electric stress and frequency. The RCT discussed in this work brings the virtues of the coaxial-type transformer, which has been use in radio frequency applications, to medium-voltage power conversion applications. The high frequency parasitic effects, which are negligible at 60Hz, become a significant concern in a SST operating above kHz range. Hence, the parasitics of the transformer need to be accurately predicted and controlled for quality power control and safety. The RCT not only minimizes the parasitics of the transformer but also integrates a resonant tank comprised of a series inductance and shunt capacitance by utilizing the stray magnetic and electric flux within the transformer. The limited space in compact size is efficiently used and materials can be optimized. The unique analytic design method of an RCT is introduced and the equivalent circuit model is developed in this paper. The specific design is based on the high performance transformer for a dual-active bridge (DAB) converter, which is one of the most popular topologies in bidirectional power conversion, in the dc-dc stage of the SST application being developed at the FREEDM System Center and its concept is verified with FEM analysis and experiments.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064014.pdf","startPage":"1873","endPage":"1880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical modeling of a medium-voltage and high-frequency resonant coaxial-type power transformer for a solid state transformer application","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analytical modeling of a medium-voltage and high-frequency resonant coaxial-type power transformer for a solid state transformer application","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344111","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064014/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical modeling of a medium-voltage and high-frequency resonant coaxial-type power transformer for a solid state transformer application","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"2870939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058537S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064036,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A new simplified model of the neutral-point voltage dynamics is derived for the proposed modulation strategy. This model shows that the neutral-point current is proportional to the power drawn from the converter and it enables the use of well established classical control theory for neutral-point voltage controller design. A PI controller is used for neutral-point voltage balance. The implementation of the proposed modulation strategy and controller is simple. It does not require any information about the output phase currents. The controller is implemented in a 7.5 kW induction machine based drive with only 14 \u03bcF DC-link capacitors.

Moreover, it is becoming a need that the wind power generation system should be more active, and able to contribute to the grid recovery by injecting reactive current during grid faults. Consequently, the full-scale power converter solutions are becoming more and more popular to fulfill the growing challenges in the wind power application. Nevertheless, the loading of the power devices in full-scale power converters, especially during grid faults may compromise the reliability performance and further increase the cost of the system. In this paper, three promising grid side multilevel converter topologies for the next generation 10 MW wind turbines are proposed and basically designed as case study. The operation status, as well as loss and thermal distributions of power devices are investigated, simulated and compared aimed at various Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) conditions. It is found that the all of the proposed converter topologies will suffer from higher junction temperature in some heavy loaded power devices especially the diodes under LVRT, and both of the three-level and five-level H-bridge topologies show more potential to reduce the device stress than the well-known three-level Neutral Point Clamped topology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal analysis of multilevel grid side converters for 10 MW wind turbines under Low Voltage Ride Through","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064048","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064048.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thermal analysis of multilevel grid side converters for 10 MW wind turbines under Low Voltage Ride Through","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064048/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344145","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal analysis of multilevel grid side converters for 10 MW wind turbines under Low Voltage Ride Through","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"3210842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068555S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6064050,"authors":[{"name":"Mingkai Mu","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingkai","lastName":"Mu","id":"37588183800"},{"name":"Yipeng Su","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yipeng","lastName":"Su","id":"37402249300"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37291116000"},{"name":"Fred C.

When an ac-dc LED driver with the function of power factor correction (PFC) outputs a pulsating current to drive LEDs, electrolytic capacitor is not required any longer. However, the pulsating current brings flicker with twice the line frequency. In this paper, the concept of flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less ac-dc driver for LED lighting is proposed, which consists of an electrolytic capacitor-less PFC converter and a bidirectional buck/boost converter. The bidirectional buck/boost converter provides the path for the ac component in the pulsating current of the PFC converter to flow through, leaving a pure dc current to drive the LEDs without flicker. The voltage of the output filter capacitor of the bidirectional converter is intentionally designed to have large ripple, and thus the capacitance can be greatly reduced. Consequently, the output filter capacitor can adopt film capacitor instead of electrolytic capacitor. So the ac-dc LED driver has no flicker and has a long lifetime. A 48 V, 0.7 A output prototype is built and tested in the lab, and the experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less ac-dc LED driver.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064076","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","startPage":"2318","endPage":"2325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less ac-dc LED driver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less ac-dc LED driver","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064076/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344173","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064076/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less ac-dc LED driver","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"3490143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059347S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064088,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37711693100"},{"name":"Dong Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37401419100"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716390800"},{"name":"Fred Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Wang","id":"37277654900"},{"name":"Leon M.

The dynamic performance of this module is evaluated by double pulse test up to 150\u00b0C, under 650 V dc bus voltage and 60 A drain current, with different turn-on and turn-off gate resistances. The current unbalance phenomenon and phase-leg shoot-through problem are analyzed too.

While much research has been conducted on the High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) made of GaN and Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN), the discussion of third quadrant operation is sparse. Furthermore, the merits of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT, in particular its switching speed, make it suitable for switched-capacitor circuits.

However, there are many limitations to the off-line and on-line methods currently used for PMSM rotor quality assessment. In this paper, an inverter-embedded technique for automated detection and classification of PMSM rotor faults is proposed as an alternative. The main concept is to use the inverter to perform a test whenever the motor is stopped, to detect rotor faults independent of operating conditions or load torque oscillations, which is not possible with motor current signature analysis (MCSA). The d-axis is excited with a dc+ac signal, and the variation in the inductance pattern due to the change in the degree of magnetic saturation caused by demagnetization or eccentricity is observed for fault detection. An experimental study on a 7.5kW PMSM verifies that demagnetization and eccentricity can be detected and classified independent of the load with high sensitivity.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064103.pdf","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064103","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of rotor demagnetization and eccentricity faults for PM synchronous motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of rotor demagnetization and eccentricity faults for PM synchronous motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064103/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064103/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344200","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of rotor demagnetization and eccentricity faults for PM synchronous motors","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"3800054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082394S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064109,"authors":[{"name":"Sayed Ali Khajehoddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queensu University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sayed Ali","lastName":"Khajehoddin","id":"37293797100"},{"name":"Masoud Karimi-Ghartemani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queensu University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Karimi-Ghartemani","id":"38276660200"},{"name":"Praveen Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queensu University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Jain","id":"37274768800"},{"name":"Alireza Bakhshai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queensu University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bakhshai","id":"37266634300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064109","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Frequency control","Robustness","Delay","Inverters","Uninterruptible power systems","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","frequency control","phase locked loops","robust control","sampling methods","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency controller","adaptive resonant controller","fixed point digital implementation","sampling frequency","robust resonant controller","polar coordinates","trigonometric operations","phase locked loop","delta-domain implementation","uninterruptable power supply"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064109","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064109.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency adaptive resonant controller for fixed point digital implementation at high sampling frequency","abstract":"For applications with high sampling frequency and word length limitation, this paper presents a robust resonant (R) controller.

Twenty-four MOSFETs and twelve Schottky diodes have been assembled in a 10 kV half H-bridge power module to increase the current handling capability to 120 A per switch without compromising the die-level characteristics. For the first time, a custom designed system (13.8 kV to 465/\u221a3 V solid state power substation) has been successfully demonstrated with these state of the art SiC modules up to 855 kVA operation and 97% efficiency.

Some of them are specific to the discrete component geometry, and the others come from stray couplings between every element of the system (the tracks as well as the components themselves). Their influences on an EMC filter response will be pointed out at first. These phenomena are commonly neglected for practical reasons. It is indeed easier to have them as low as possible by following some guidelines. The filter response is therefore the closest from the theoretical behaviour without stray couplings, but it is not the best optimisation. This paper proposes a new way to optimise an EMC filter by considering some parasitic phenomena through a new analytical modelling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064130.pdf","startPage":"2693","endPage":"2700","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal stray magnetic couplings for EMC filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic separation","Electromagnetic compatibility","Optimization","Analytical models","Couplings","Transfer functions","Delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","electromagnetic compatibility","filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal stray magnetic couplings","EMC filters","electo-magnetic compatibility","electrostatic imperfections","magnetic imperfections","discrete component geometry","parasitic phenomena"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal stray magnetic couplings for EMC filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344227","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal stray magnetic couplings for EMC filters","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"4110260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065561S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064133,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang Hammel","affiliation":["SEW-EURODRIVE GmbH and Company KG, Bruchsal, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Hammel","id":"38556661700"},{"name":"Ralph M.

However these types of machines have no geometrical saliencies and the exploitable magnetic anisotropies result solely from magnetic saturation and are therefore very small. The measurable position dependent current components resulting from injected high frequency voltages are hence very small and a high resolution current measurement is needed. This paper proposes a novel technique for injecting an alternating carrier voltage. The high frequency current components are measured using delta-sigma-modulators. Suitable design of the low-pass filters and appropriate processing of the measured current values allows to achieve a very high signal to noise ratio. The proposed analytical approach to separate the high frequency current components from the fundamental wave current portion avoids any interference between the current controller and the high frequency voltage injection. Therefore the extracted position information will not be affected by the fundamental current components even during transient conditions. The separation scheme is free of any motor parameters and can cope with significant nonlinear inductances.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064133","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064133.pdf","startPage":"2717","endPage":"2724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution sensorless position estimation using delta-sigma-modulated current measurement","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064133/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344230","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064133/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution sensorless position estimation using delta-sigma-modulated current measurement","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"4140706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056067S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6064145,"authors":[{"name":"Tsarafidy Raminosoa","affiliation":["Electrical Machines Lab, GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tsarafidy","lastName":"Raminosoa","id":"37293755300"},{"name":"Tahar Hamiti","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Research Group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Tahar","lastName":"Hamiti","id":"37658120600"},{"name":"Michael Galea","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Research Group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Galea","id":"37531777700"},{"name":"Chris Gerada","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Research Group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Gerada","id":"37268041400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064145","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"abstract":"This paper considers the feasibility of equipping the main landing gears with electric motors for the aircraft traction during the taxi phase.

The idea is to replace ordinary capacitors of a 3-level flying capacitor inverter by supercapacitors and operate them under variable voltage conditions. This approach eliminates the need of interfacing dc-dc converters for supercapacitor integration and thus considerably improves the overall efficiency. However, the major problem of this unique system is the change of supercapacitor voltages. An analysis on the effects of these voltage variations are presented. A space vector modulation method, built from the scratch, is proposed to generate undistorted current even in the presence of dynamic changes in supercapacitor voltages. A supercapacitor voltage equalisation algorithm is also proposed. Furthermore, resistive behavior of supercapacitors at high frequencies and the need for a low pass filter are highlighted. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system in suppressing short term wind power fluctuations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Supercapacitors","Inverters","Switches","Modulation","Wind power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","invertors","low-pass filters","supercapacitors","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-level capacitor clamped inverter","power smoothing element","wind power system","direct integration scheme","short term power fluctuation mitigation","3-level flying capacitor inverter","DC-DC converter","space vector modulation method","supercapacitor voltage equalisation algorithm","low pass filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064168","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064168.pdf","startPage":"2963","endPage":"2970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis on the possibility of using capacitors of a three-level capacitor clamped inverter as power smoothing elements for wind power systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analysis on the possibility of using capacitors of a three-level capacitor clamped inverter as power smoothing elements for wind power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064168/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064168/","accessionNumber":"12344264","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis on the possibility of using capacitors of a three-level capacitor clamped inverter as power smoothing elements for wind power systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"4490274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067918S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6064170,"authors":[{"name":"Mebtu Beza","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Environment, Chalmers, University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mebtu","lastName":"Beza","id":"37590035300"},{"name":"Massimo Bongiorno","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Environment, Chalmers, University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Bongiorno","id":"37565335900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064170","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"abstract":"This paper deals with a control strategy for power oscillation damping using Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with energy storage.

Compared to conventional heterodyning process, the proposed method is simple to implement and appropriate for PWM switching frequency signal injection. The high frequency voltage signal can be injected in the stationary reference frame or in the estimated rotor reference frame. In this paper, two sensorless methods are proposed according to the injection reference frame. To verify the proposed methods, 5kHz voltage signal injection with 5kHz PWM switching frequency inverter system in both reference frames were implemented.

Particularly attractive is the interior PM (IPM) machine, since it is characterized by two torque components: the PM torque and the reluctance torque. Thanks to this feature, the IPM machine is able to operate under flux-weakening conditions, as required by many applications, such as automotive, machine tools, washing machines, and so on. Another feature is that the rotor position can be detected without sensor also at zero speed, by means of techniques based on high-frequency signal injection. The aim of this paper is to investigate the torque components and the sensorless position detection capability of an IPM dual three-phase machine equipped with two fractional-slot windings. These two windings are designed to be supplied by two separate converters, yielding an increase of the fault-tolerant capability of the machine. The analysis and the tests presented deal with the capability of the machine when it operates under healthy as well as faulty conditions, that is, when one three-phase winding set is removed and only one continues to be supplied.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064178","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064178.pdf","startPage":"3037","endPage":"3044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless rotor position detection capability of a dual three-phase fractional-slot IPM machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064178/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless rotor position detection capability of a dual three-phase fractional-slot IPM machine","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344274","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064178/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless rotor position detection capability of a dual three-phase fractional-slot IPM machine","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"4590238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105324S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064180,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Karimi-Ghartemani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queens University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Karimi-Ghartemani","id":"38276660200"},{"name":"Sayed Ali Khajehoddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queens University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sayed Ali","lastName":"Khajehoddin","id":"37293797100"},{"name":"Praveen Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queens University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Jain","id":"37274768800"},{"name":"Alireza Bakhshai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queens University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bakhshai","id":"37266634300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064180","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Band pass filters","Harmonic analysis","Mathematical model","Frequency estimation","Equations","Power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","computational complexity","phase locked loops","signal conditioning circuits","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-locked loop","DC component","analog/digital converters","signal conditioning","low-frequency oscillations","pre-filter","signal estimation","transient response","computational complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064180","abstract":"This paper studies two methods of addressing the DC component in phase-locked loop (PLL) systems.

The risk of instability due to the use of constant power loads stems from the implementation of controlled output power conversion systems. In three phase converters, these issues are difficult to measure. Although there have been developments in the determination of system stability at interfaces due to stability, a framework to perform measurements necessary for such a determination has not been fully developed. This paper presents a method to measure three phase impedances in the D-Q rotating reference frame for three phase AC systems and demonstrates the successful implementation and operation of such a system.

An established method to achieve very low current distortions during steady-state operation is to employ offline calculated optimized pulse patterns (OPP). Achieving high dynamic performance, however, proves to be very difficult in a system operated by OPPs. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the optimal steady-state performance of OPPs with the very fast dynamics of trajectory tracking control. A constrained optimal control problem with a receding horizon policy, i.e. model predictive control (MPC), is formulated and solved. Results show that the combination of MPC with OPPs satisfies both the strict steady-state as well as the dynamic performance requirements imposed by the most demanding industrial applications. This is achieved without resorting to complicated structures such as observers of the state variable fundamental components of the electrical machine, which are required by state-of-the-art methods. A further advantage of the MPC method is the use of a receding horizon policy to provide feedback and a high degree of robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064215","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064215.pdf","startPage":"3306","endPage":"3313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive pulse pattern control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064215/","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive pulse pattern control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344310","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064215/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive pulse pattern control","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"4960159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075095S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064229,"authors":[{"name":"Till Boller","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Drives lab, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Till","lastName":"Boller","id":"37399217400"},{"name":"Joachim Holtz","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Drives lab, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Holtz","id":"37267042900"},{"name":"Akshay Kumar Rathore","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Akshay Kumar","lastName":"Rathore","id":"37395556200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064229","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Switching frequency","Optimization","Harmonic distortion","Inductors","Switches","Medium voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","motor drives","PWM invertors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal pulsewidth modulation","dual three-level inverter system","single dc link circuit","five-level output voltage waveforms","drive motor","open stator windings","common mode voltage components","motor voltages","off-line optimization method","harmonic distortion","motor currents","switching frequency","drive system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064229","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064229.pdf","startPage":"3406","endPage":"3410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal pulsewidth modulation of a dual three-level inverter system operated from a single dc link","abstract":"Operating a dual three-level inverter system from a single dc link circuit is an economic solution for generating five-level output voltage waveforms and to double the output power compared to a single three-level inverter.

This paper presents an improved gradient driver structure and a new modulation scheme, with which the switching frequency will vary according to the slew rate of the current command. The corresponding output filter design is also introduced. With the proposed technique the switching loss can be reduced and evenly distributed in all the bridges, therefore the utilization ratio of the semiconductor devices is improved and the number of devices in parallel can be reduced. A 2 MVA platform has been built and fully tested. The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed structure and modulation technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bridge circuits","Switching

Shunt Active Filter (SAF) used for harmonic compensation in new generation aircrafts, where a Variable Speed Variable-Frequency (VSVF) power system, typically between 360 and 900Hz, is nowadays used. Due to the high supply frequency, such applications are particularly demanding for both power and control devices, requiring control capabilities even for frequencies up to several kHz. Furthermore variable supply frequency leads to variable frequency harmonics in the aircraft grid that are challenging to track and compensate. An original and effective solution based on an iterative learning control approach, where both the number of samples per period and the sampling frequency are changed, is studied and implemented. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064246/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344341","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Variable sampling frequency in iterative learning current Control for Shunt Active Filter in aircraft power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable sampling frequency in iterative learning current Control for Shunt Active Filter in aircraft power systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"5270483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051245S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064271,"authors":[{"name":"Nam-Joon Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nam-Joon","lastName":"Ku","id":"38027652300"},{"name":"Hong-Ju Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Ju","lastName":"Jung","id":"37065899200"},{"name":"Rae-Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Rae-Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37371073200"},{"name":"Dong-Suk Hyun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Suk","lastName":"Hyun","id":"37271430600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064271","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor diodes","Switching loss","Silicon carbide","Switches","Clamps","Inverters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","PWM invertors","silicon compounds","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching loss minimized PWM method","high switching frequency three-level inverter","clamp diode","reverse recovery characteristic","switching states","numerical analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064271","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064271.pdf","startPage":"3702","endPage":"3707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel switching loss minimized PWM method for a high switching frequency three-level inverter with a SiC clamp diode","abstract":"The previous papers introduce the inverters replacing Si diode with SiC diode to reduce the switching loss. In the NPC inverter, the switching loss is also reduced by replacing device in the clamp diode. However, the switching loss in IGBT is large and the reduced switching loss cannot be still neglected. This paper presents the reverse recovery characteristic according to the change of switching states when Si diode and SiC diode are used as clamp diode and proposes a method to minimize the switching loss containing the reverse recovery loss in NPC inverter at low modulation index. It is expected that the reverse recovery loss can be almost eliminated and the switching loss can be considerably reduced by the proposed method.

In the SDRE approach, the nonlinear system is assumed as a frozen-in-time linear time varying system, the state conditions which include parameter variations were reflected to the feedback system.

In addition to the high-frequency leakage current caused by the PWM switching schemes, low-frequency leakage current limits the value of dc-side common-mode (CM) capacitors, thereby leading to the bulky dc passive filters for many distributed generation (DG) system applications. In order to reduce the low-frequency dc CM voltage ripple, this paper proposes a PWM modulation scheme and an associated controller for the grid-connected converter based on the North American single-phase (1\u03a6) system. The modeling, controller design and ac passive filter design are analyzed.

However, the inherent resonance of an LCL filter makes the control of such a system challenging, and different passive and active damping strategies have been developed till now. This paper aims to the damping problems of LCL filters and proposes a new approach to realize active damping. Based on traditional virtual resistance damping strategy, the new algorithm employs a lead compensation block in the capacitor current feedback loop so as to alleviate the impact of control delay. It is easy to be transformed from conventional virtual resistance damping method since just an additional digital filter is needed. Theoretical analyses for the essence equivalent relationship between passive damping and virtual resistance damping, as well as the impact investigation of control delay are made in details. The results show that the traditional virtual resistance active damping method is equivalent to passive damping of connecting damping resistance in parallel with the capacitor in the control block diagram, while the proposed virtual resistance active damping method is equivalent to passive damping of connecting damping resistance in series with the capacitor in the control block diagram. Both simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064287","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","startPage":"3816","endPage":"3822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved virtual resistance damping method for grid-connected inverters with LCL filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved virtual resistance damping method for grid-connected inverters with LCL filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064287/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344382","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064287/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved virtual resistance damping method for grid-connected inverters with LCL filters","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"5680396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118418S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064290,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Mo","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Mo","id":"37717666500"},{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Poh Chiang","lastName":"Loh","id":"37275742000"},{"name":"Andrew","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Andrew","id":"38016482100"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064290","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Inductors","Switches","Transient analysis","Switching frequency","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","invertors","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control","Z-source neutral point clamped inverter","current control","system constraints","load current","impedance network inductor current","capacitor voltage","transient response","stability","level constraint","variable switching frequency","operation steady state simulation","transient state simulation","reference tracking ability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064290","abstract":"This paper presents Model Predictive Control (MPC) of Z-source Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter.

The proposed current balancer can use a 6-in-1 IGBT module. Two legs perform a half-bridge inverter based current balancer, which compensates the reactive and unbalanced active components on the source-side. The third-leg performs a power de-coupler with a dc-capacitor voltage balancer. This power de-coupler sinks the power fluctuation, which flows into the dc capacitors, caused by the unbalanced conditions of two half-bridge inverters. Thus the capacity of the dc capacitors of the half-bridge inverter based current balancer can be dramatically reduced as compared to those of the previously proposed current balancer. The basic principle of the proposed half-bridge inverter based current balancer with the reduced dc capacitors is discussed in detail, and then confirmed by digital computer simulation using PSIM software. A prototype experimental model is constructed and tested. Experimental results demonstrate that the balanced source currents are obtained on the secondary-side of the pole-mounted distribution transformer, reducing the capacity of the dc capacitors of the half-bridge inverter based current balancer.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2011.6064347","startPage":"4233","endPage":"4239","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056715/6063732/06064347.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A half-bridge inverter based current balancer with the reduced dc capacitors in single-phase three-wire distribution feeders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A half-bridge inverter based current balancer with the reduced dc capacitors in single-phase three-wire distribution feeders","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064347/","accessionNumber":"12344442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064347/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A half-bridge inverter based current balancer with the reduced dc capacitors in single-phase three-wire distribution feeders","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"6280399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075919S","chronDate":"17-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056715","isNumber":"6063732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056715","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6063732","articleId":"6064347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6064349,"authors":[{"name":"Subhashish Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Subhashish","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37307719200"},{"name":"Saman Babaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Babaei","id":"38505942900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0541-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0542-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0540-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6064349","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064349","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Snubbers","Logic gates","Voltage measurement","Valves","Switches","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","RC circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["series connected IGCT","three-level neutral point clamped voltage source inverter pole","high power converters","EMTDC model","three level NPC inverter pole","switching transitions","RC snubber circuit","dynamic voltage sharing","H-bridge","voltage 4.5 kV","current 4 kA","apparent power 12 MVA"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports design and experimental verification of series connected 4.5kV, 4kA IGCT based high power three-level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter pole.

Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064380/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12343770","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of wireless sensor networks towards the Internet of Things: A survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of wireless sensor networks towards the Internet of Things: A survey","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"EvolutionWirelessVilei2032739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096975S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056504","isNumber":"6064354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056504","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6064354","articleId":"6064380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6064400,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Balyan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Balyan","id":"37586248100"},{"name":"Davinder S Saini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Davinder S","lastName":"Saini","id":"37286234600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-026-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1439-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-027-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6064400","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Delay","Spread spectrum communication","Complexity theory","Telecommunication traffic","Wideband","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code assignment design","code reassignment design","new code blocking","WCDMA networks","orthogonal variable spreading factor codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OVSF codes","code blocking","assignment","reassignment"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes supports variable data rates using different physical channels.

The separation is performed in three stages. In the first stage, the mixing matrix in each frequency bin is estimated by the proposed single source detection and clustering (SSDC) algorithm. In the second stage, by assuming complex-valued super-Gaussian distribution, the sources are estimated by minimizing a mean-square-error (MSE) criterion. Special consideration is given to reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. In the last stage, the estimated sources in each frequency bin are aligned for recovery. In our simulations, the proposed algorithm outperformed conventional algorithm in terms of the mixing-error-ratio and the signal-to-distortion ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6058570/6064496/06064629.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underdetermined convolutive blind source separation using a novel mixing matrix estimation and MMSE-based source estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Vectors","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation","Source separation","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underdetermined convolutive blind source separation","mixing matrix estimation","MMSE-based source estimation","super-Gaussian signal","frequency bin","complex-valued super-Gaussian distribution","mean square error criterion","mixing error ratio","signal-to-distortion ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Underdetermined convolutive blind source separation using a novel mixing matrix estimation and MMSE-based source estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064629/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344605","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underdetermined convolutive blind source separation using a novel mixing matrix estimation and MMSE-based source estimation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"mlsp2011paper122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054599S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6058570","isNumber":"6064496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6058570","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6064496","articleId":"6064629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064650,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, based on alpha stable processes, an analytical co-channel interference model is proposed for multi-cell multiple-input multi-output (MIMO) cellular networks. The impact of different channel parameters on the new interference model is analyzed numerically. Furthermore, the exact normalized downlink average capacity is derived for a multi-cell MIMO cellular network with co-channel interference. Moreover, the closed-form normalized downlink average capacity is derived for cell-edge users in multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) cooperative cellular networks with co-channel interference. From the new co-channel interference model and capacity formulas, the impact of cooperative antennas and base stations on cell-edge user performance in the multi-cell multi-antenna cellular network is investigated by numerical methods. Numerical results show that cooperative transmission can improve the capacity performance of multi-cell multi-antenna cooperative cellular networks, especially in a scenario with a high density of interfering base stations. The capacity performance gain is degraded with the increased number of cooperative antennas or base stations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.11.101551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/06064713.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.11.101551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3298","endPage":"3309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Cooperative Cellular Network with Co-Channel Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Cooperative Cellular Network with Co-Channel Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064713/","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6064713/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359552","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of a Multi-Cell Multi-Antenna Cooperative Cellular Network with Co-Channel Interference","sourcePdf":"3298-tw1110-ge.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098552S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6064713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6064852,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Umbu Tana Amah","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computational Engineering and the Communications Engineering Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany","Communication Technology Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Aditya Umbu Tana","lastName":"Amah","id":"37396079800"},{"name":"Anja Klein","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Klein","id":"37288187900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6064852","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Array signal processing","Antennas","Network coding","Signal to noise ratio","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-regenerative multi-way relaying","repetition","channel state information","multi-antenna relay station","stationary channels","space-time analog network coding transmission","zero forcing detection","back-propagated self-interference cancellation","joint detection","maximisation of signal to noise ratio transceive beamforming","single stream decoding","multi-way communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-way relaying","analog network coding","space-time block code"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Regenerative Multi-Way Relaying: Space-Time Analog Network Coding and Repetition","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.101411.111780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","endPage":"1364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06064852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.101411.111780","startPage":"1362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064852","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate non-regenerative multi-way relaying when channel state information is not available at the multi-antenna relay station (RS). For stationary channels, space-time analog network coding (STANC) transmission is applied at the RS. For non-stationary channels, the RS applies repetition transmission. For both transmission schemes, in order to obtain the data streams of the other nodes, each node has to perform three receive processing operations successively: Zero Forcing (ZF) detection, back-propagated self-interference cancellation and joint detection. We assess the achievable sum rate performance of non-regenerative multi-way relaying for the proposed transmission schemes. It is shown that STANC with joint detection outperforms both benchmark transmissions, namely, ZF and Maximisation of Signal to Noise Ratio (MSNR) transceive beamforming with single stream decoding performed at each node. When the channels are non-stationary, the repetition transmission enables the multi-way communication and in medium to high SNR region, it outperforms MSNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425084","htmlLink":"/document/6064852/","displayDocTitle":"Non-Regenerative Multi-Way Relaying: Space-Time Analog Network Coding and Repetition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Regenerative Multi-Way Relaying: Space-Time Analog Network Coding and Repetition","sourcePdf":"1362-cl1112-amah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066932S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6104419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6104419","articleId":"6064852","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064854,"authors":[{"name":"Zaishuang Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zaishuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37711266300"},{"name":"Qiuliang Xie","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiuliang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37398168900"},{"name":"Kewu Peng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37274592000"},{"name":"Zhixing Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6064854","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":26,"totalDownloads":2902},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064854","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Digital video broadcasting","Bit error rate","Turbo codes","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase measurement","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["APSK constellation","amplitude phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM counterpart","Gray mapping","high independent demapping loss","Gray-APSK","iterative demapping","average mutual information analysis","bit error rate simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["APSK","Gray mapping","shaping gain"]}],"abstract":"Amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) constellation is superior to its quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) counterpart from the mutual information point of view.

The continuous wideband tunability of the microwave photonic filter is also demonstrated by adjusting the bias current of FP-SOA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2174196","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6083491/06064859.pdf","startPage":"3542","endPage":"3550","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2174196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Passband Microwave Photonic Filter With Continuous Wideband Tunability Based on Electro-Optic Phase Modulator and Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2011","displayDocTitle":"Single Passband Microwave Photonic Filter With Continuous Wideband Tunability Based on Electro-Optic Phase Modulator and Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","volume":"29","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/6064859/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12384918","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Passband Microwave Photonic Filter With Continuous Wideband Tunability Based on Electro-Optic Phase Modulator and Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2174196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071548S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6083491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6083491","articleId":"6064859","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6064860,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung Kyu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyung Kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"38182611300"},{"name":"Renata Melamud","affiliation":["SiTime Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Renata","lastName":"Melamud","id":"37397374900"},{"name":"Saurabh Chandorkar","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Chandorkar","id":"37394390200"},{"name":"James Salvia","affiliation":["SiTime Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Salvia","id":"37397373600"},{"name":"Shingo Yoneoka","affiliation":["MCube Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoneoka","id":"37390970800"},{"name":"Thomas W.

Many attempts based on analytical schemes are exerted for this purpose. However, these analytical methods are developed for specific problems, and usually synthesis of the radiation pattern is subject to only one restriction. On the other hand, optimization algorithms are utilized for more general problems. However, these algorithms require more computational time. In this letter, a new hybrid technique for synthesizing arbitrary-shaped radiation pattern using a linear array is developed. The algorithm is based on a combination between the method of moments (MoM) and the genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed algorithm is applied to synthesis of both symmetric and asymmetric radiation pattern distributions with minimum number of elements. Excellent agreement is obtained by comparison to other analytical and optimization techniques.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2174189","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/06064870.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2174189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Design of Linear Antenna Arrays Using a Hybrid MoM/GA Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design of Linear Antenna Arrays Using a Hybrid MoM/GA Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064870/","volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6064870/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2011","accessionNumber":"12335718","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Design of Linear Antenna Arrays Using a Hybrid MoM/GA Algorithm","sourcePdf":"lawp-hussein-2174189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066276S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"6064870","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6064871,"authors":[{"name":"Tam N.

The method is formulated as a hidden Markov model, where the hidden states correspond to the different fingering configurations and the observed acoustic features are obtained from a multiple fundamental frequency estimator that measures the salience of a range of candidate note pitches within individual time frames. Transitions between consecutive fingerings are constrained by a musical model trained on a database of chord sequences, and a heuristic cost function that measures the physical difficulty of moving from one configuration of finger positions to another. The method was evaluated on recordings from the acoustic, electric, and the Spanish guitar and clearly outperformed a non-guitar-specific reference chord transcription method despite the fact that the number of chords considered here is significantly larger.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2174227","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6125258/06064873.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2174227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Transcription of Guitar Chords and Fingering From Audio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Transcription of Guitar Chords and Fingering From Audio","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12485327","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6064873/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Transcription of Guitar Chords and Fingering From Audio","sourcePdf":"tasl-barbancho-2174227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077414S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6064873","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6064874,"authors":[{"name":"Yiteng Arden Huang","affiliation":["We Voice, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6145765/6064874/6064874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiteng (Arden) Huang (S'97\u2013M'01) received the B.S. degree from the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1994 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in 1998 and 2001, respectively, all in electrical and computer engineering.","From March 2001 to January 2008, he was a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ.

The simplicity and relative effectiveness of this class of approaches make them the dominant choice in practical systems. Over the past years, many popular algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms, no matter how they are developed, have one feature in common: the solution is eventually formulated as a gain function applied to the STFT of the noisy signal only in the current frame, implying that the interframe correlation is ignored. This assumption is not accurate for speech enhancement since speech is a highly self-correlated signal. In this paper, by taking the interframe correlation into account, a new linear model for speech spectral estimation and some optimal filters are proposed. They include the multi-frame Wiener and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filters. With these filters, both the narrowband and fullband signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can be improved. Furthermore, with the MVDR filter, speech distortion at the output can be zero. Simulations present promising results in support of the claimed merits obtained by theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Noise reduction","Speech enhancement","Frequency domain analysis","Noise measurement","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal denoising","speech enhancement","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi frame approach","frequency domain single channel noise reduction problem","short time Fourier transform","noisy signal","speech enhancement","speech spectral estimation","optimal filter","multiframe Wiener filter","minimum variance distortionless response filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency domain","interframe correlation","maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) filter","minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter","single-channel noise reduction","speech enhancement","tradeoff filter","Wiener filter"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2174226","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06064874.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2174226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Frame Approach to the Frequency-Domain Single-Channel Noise Reduction Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Frame Approach to the Frequency-Domain Single-Channel Noise Reduction Problem","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12536600","publicationDate":"May 2012","volume":"20","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064874/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Frame Approach to the Frequency-Domain Single-Channel Noise Reduction Problem","sourcePdf":"tasl-huang-2174226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091504S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6064874","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6064879,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Chai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Center for Integrated Systems, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6117780/6064879/6064879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Chai received the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2009.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Center for Integrated Systems, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, working on the fabrication of carbon-related materials and carbon-based devices, including testing and characterization of the resulting prototypes."]},"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Chai","id":"37577947100"},{"name":"Arash Hazeghi","affiliation":["Quswami Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6117780/6064879/6064879-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Hazeghi received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","During his time at Stanford, he was a member of the Stanford Nanoelectronics Group led by Prof. Wong.

In this paper, the performance and the energy dissipation of graphene spin interconnects in a nonlocal spin-torque (NLST) circuit are compared against those of the CMOS circuit at the end of the silicon technology roadmap (technology year 2020). The interconnect-oriented limitations of the NLST circuit are quantified through exhaustive simulations. The impact of the electron scattering at the edges of the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) on the speed and the energy dissipation of the NLST circuit are evaluated. It is found that, if the edges in the GNR scatter electrons with a 100% probability, then the delay of the interconnect in the NLST circuit is 10\u00d7 higher than its value at perfectly passivated GNR edges for an interconnect with a length of 100 gate pitches and a width of 14 nm. The scattering of electrons at the GNR edges leads to inefficient spin injection in the interconnect, which increases the energy dissipation of the NLST circuit. Energy versus delay landscapes of the NLST circuit and the CMOS circuit are compared. It is found that the energy versus delay of the NLST circuit exhibits a minimum in energy, which is in striking in contrast with the energy-versus-delay behavior of the CMOS circuit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphene Nanoribbon Spin Interconnects for Nonlocal Spin-Torque Circuits: Comparison of Performance and Energy Per Bit With CMOS Interconnects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2171186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6117780/06064882.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2171186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Graphene Nanoribbon Spin Interconnects for Nonlocal Spin-Torque Circuits: Comparison of Performance and Energy Per Bit With CMOS Interconnects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6064882/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426999","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphene Nanoribbon Spin Interconnects for Nonlocal Spin-Torque Circuits: Comparison of Performance and Energy Per Bit With CMOS Interconnects","sourcePdf":"ted-rakheja-2171186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095033S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6117780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6117780","articleId":"6064882","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6064883,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri Tkachev","affiliation":["Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6117780/6064883/6064883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuri Tkachev (M'05) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, Moscow, Russia, in 1983.","From 1983 to 1987, he was a Research Engineer with the Institute of Micro Devices, Kiev, Ukraine, developing CMOS and MNOS EEPROM technology.

Two assumptions are made: 1) The Zadeh AND operator is employed as the t-norm operator; 2) type-reduction is performed by the Karnik-Mendel (KM) type-reduction method. The main contributions are the methodology that identifies the input conditions, where the KM algorithm uses a new switch point to compute the bounds of the type-reduced set, the closed-form expressions that relate the inputs and output of an IT2 fuzzy controller, and insights into the potential performance improvement because of the inclusion of the footprint of uncertainty (FOU). Compared with its T1 counterpart, two additional FOU parameters generate 31 extra local regions, each providing a unique relationship between the inputs and output signals. The generation of a relatively large number of local regions at the cost of two extra design parameters indicates that an IT2 fuzzy controller may be able to provide better performance. Furthermore, by comparing the analytical structure with the corresponding T1 counterpart, the potential advantages to use the IT2 over the T1 fuzzy controller are studied. Four interesting characteristics are identified, and they provide insights into why the IT2 fuzzy controller may better balance the conflicting aims of fast rise time and small overshoot.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2174061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6205698/06064887.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2174061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6205698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Structure and Characteristics of Symmetric Karnik\u2013Mendel Type-Reduced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PI and PD Controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064887/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Structure and Characteristics of Symmetric Karnik\u2013Mendel Type-Reduced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PI and PD Controllers","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761927","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064887/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Structure and Characteristics of Symmetric Karnik\u2013Mendel Type-Reduced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PI and PD Controllers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-tan-2174061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102423S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6205698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6205698","articleId":"6064887","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6064888,"authors":[{"name":"Xun-Lin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China","Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6176019/6064888/6064888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xun-Lin Zhu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Information Engineering Institute of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhengzhou, China, in 1986, the M.S. degree in mathematics from Zhengzhou University in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2008.","From November 2008 to December 2009, he was a Research Fellow with the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Further, many CPSs that utilize Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) technologies will require the use of energy harvesting methods to extend their lifetimes. For this application class, there are currently few algorithmic techniques that combine performance sensitive processing and communication with efficient management techniques for energy harvesting. Our paper addresses this problem. We first propose a general purpose, multihop WSN architecture capable of supporting time-critical CPS systems using energy harvesting. We then present a set of Harvesting Aware Speed Selection (HASS) algorithms. Our technique maximizes the minimum energy reserve for all the nodes in the network, thus ensuring highly resilient performance under emergency or fault-driven situations. We present an optimal centralized solution, along with an efficient, distributed solution. We propose a CPS-specific experimental methodology, enabling us to evaluate our approach. Our experiments show that our algorithms yield significantly higher energy reserves than baseline methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2174247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6387656/06064890.pdf","endPage":"526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harvesting-Aware Energy Management for Time-Critical Wireless Sensor Networks With Joint Voltage and Modulation Scaling","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2174247","startPage":"514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Harvesting-Aware Energy Management for Time-Critical Wireless Sensor Networks With Joint Voltage and Modulation Scaling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064890/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188375","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6064890/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harvesting-Aware Energy Management for Time-Critical Wireless Sensor Networks With Joint Voltage and Modulation Scaling","sourcePdf":"tii-zhang-2174247-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090737S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6387656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6387656","articleId":"6064890","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6064895,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c1lvaro Hernandez","affiliation":["GEINTRA Group, Department of Electronics, University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcala de Henares, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6205705/6064895/6064895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00c1lvaro Hern\u00e1ndez (M'06) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Alcal\u00e1 (UAH), Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain, and from Blaise Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, France, in 2003.","He is currently an Associate Professor of digital systems and electronic design with the GEINTRA Group, Department of Electronics, UAH.

Unlike conventional machine learning situations, data flow targeted by incremental learning becomes available continuously over time. Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to abandon the traditional assumption of the availability of representative training data during the training period to develop decision boundaries. Under scenarios of continuous data flow, the challenge is how to transform the vast amount of stream raw data into information and knowledge representation, and accumulate experience over time to support future decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a general adaptive incremental learning framework named ADAIN that is capable of learning from continuous raw data, accumulating experience over time, and using such knowledge to improve future learning and prediction performance. Detailed system level architecture and design strategies are presented in this paper. Simulation results over several real-world data sets are used to validate the effectiveness of this method.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2171713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099844/06064897.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2171713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Learning From Stream Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Learning From Stream Data","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409297","pubMedId":"22057060","htmlLink":"/document/6064897/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Learning From Stream Data","sourcePdf":"tnn-he-pt1-2171713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137677S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6099844","articleId":"6064897","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064898,"authors":[{"name":"Zhishan Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099844/6064898/6064898-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhishan Guo (S'10) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the M.Phil. degree in mechanical and automation engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

One can find several estimation schemes in the literature related to the direction of arrivals and/or direction of departures, but their ultimate performance in terms of the statistical resolution limit (SRL) have not been fully investigated. In this correspondence, we fill this lack. Particulary, we derive the SRL to resolve two closely spaced targets in clutter interference using a MIMO radar with widely separated antennas. Toward this end, we use a hypothesis test formulation based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Furthermore, we investigate the link between the SRL and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to resolve two closely spaced targets for a given probability of false alarm and for a given probability of detection. Finally, theoretical and numerical analysis of the SRL are given for several scenarios (with/without clutter interference, known/unknown parameters of interest and known/unknown noise variance).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06064907.pdf","startPage":"987","endPage":"992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Resolution Limit for Source Localization With Clutter Interference in a MIMO Radar Context","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Clutter","MIMO radar","Signal resolution","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","interference (signal)","MIMO radar","radar clutter","radar signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical resolution limit","source localization","clutter interference","MIMO radar","multiple input multiple ouput radar","direction of arrival","generalized likelihood ratio test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutter interference","MIMO radar","performance analysis","statistical resolution limit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Resolution Limit for Source Localization With Clutter Interference in a MIMO Radar Context","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6064907/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471553","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Resolution Limit for Source Localization With Clutter Interference in a MIMO Radar Context","sourcePdf":"tsp-elkorso-2174232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185916S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6064907","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6064908,"authors":[{"name":"Lionel Fillatre","affiliation":["ICD LM2S, UMR STMR CNRS 6279, Universit\u00e9 de technologie de Troyes, Troyes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6064908/6064908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lionel Fillatre (M'11) received the M.Sc. degree in decision and information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in systems optimization from the Troyes University of Technology (UTT), France, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From 2005 to 2007, he was with T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France.

The mean level and the covariance matrix of the image, considered as a quantized Gaussian random matrix, are unknown. An adaptive statistical test is designed such that its probability distribution is always independent of the unknown image parameters, while ensuring a high probability of hidden bits detection. This test is based on the likelihood ratio test except that the unknown parameters are replaced by estimates based on a local linear regression model. It is shown that this test maximizes the probability of detection as the image size becomes arbitrarily large and the quantization step vanishes. This provides an asymptotic upper-bound for the detection of hidden bits based on the LSB replacement mechanism.

It has been shown that some of these beamformers can be formulated equivalently as one-dimensional (ID) covariance fitting problems. Based on this formulation, we show that these beamformers lead to inherently nonoptimum results in the presence of interferers. To mitigate the detrimental effect of interferers, we extend the ID covariance fitting approach to multidimensional (MD) covariance fitting, modeling the source steering vectors by means of uncertainty sets. The proposed MD covariance fitting approach leads to a nonconvex optimization problem. We develop a convex approximation of this problem, which can be solved, for example, by means of the logarithmic barrier method. The complexity required to compute the barrier function and its first- and second-order derivatives is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer based on MD covariance fitting achieves an improved performance as compared to the state-of-the-art narrowband beamformers in scenarios with large sample support.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06064910.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"740","endPage":"753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Multidimensional Covariance Fitting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Multidimensional Covariance Fitting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064910/","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6064910/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471556","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Multidimensional Covariance Fitting","sourcePdf":"tsp-rubsamen-2174233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077211S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6064910","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6064918,"authors":[{"name":"Robert S.

Currently the ability to manage the total system is available only through a centralized controller, which limits flexibility, reconfigurability, and reliability. These limitations can be avoided while still providing system level coordination through the use of distributed controls based on local information. All elements of the power system including source, loads, and the network itself have influence, interaction, and coupling to all other elements. Therefore, it is necessary to model and control a microgrid as a system of systems that share some common aspects, such as voltage levels, but can operate independently. Using local information in the form of the bus voltage, these techniques do not rely on a centralized controller, which improves system reliability. However, it is important to design the microgrid in such a manner as to take advantage of the energy not just from the generation sources, but also the energy stored in the individual points-of-load as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064918/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12543444","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Load as an Energy Asset in a Distributed DC SmartGrid Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Load as an Energy Asset in a Distributed DC SmartGrid Architecture","sourcePdf":"tsg-balog-2167722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068665S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6064918","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6064922,"authors":[{"name":"Niklas Lotze","affiliation":["Fritz Huettinger Chair of Microelectronics, Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6109882/6064922/6064922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Niklas Lotze (S'10) received the Dipl.-Ing.

However, power converters are inherently nonlinear and time-varying systems. Therefore, a small-signal harmonic model needs to be derived. While there have been many methods to obtain the small-signal models of DC-DC converters, most of these methods cannot be directly applied to AC-DC converters. Moreover, while accurate methods exist for obtaining accurate models of open-loop AC-DC converters, there are few existing methods for obtaining accurate models for closed-loop AC-DC converters. This paper proposes an analytical method for obtaining an accurate small-signal harmonic model for a power converter. The proposed method is based on state-variable sensitivity methods, which have been previously used to derive a transfer function of a DC-DC converter. This paper will show what modifications are required to extend it to derive the small-signal harmonic model of a closed-loop AC-DC converter. A small-signal harmonic model of a closed-loop pulse-width modulated (PWM) voltage source converter (VSC) with synchronous frame current controllers and a dc voltage controller is derived based on the proposed method. The results are in good agreement with large-signal simulations by means of PSCAD/EMTDC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638988","htmlLink":"/document/6064923/","displayDocTitle":"Derivation of a Small-Signal Harmonic Model for Closed-Loop Power Converters Based on the State-Variable Sensitivity Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivation of a Small-Signal Harmonic Model for Closed-Loop Power Converters Based on the State-Variable Sensitivity Method","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lian-2169731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147865S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6174505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6174505","articleId":"6064923","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6064943,"authors":[{"name":"Blake Nelson","affiliation":["School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Blake","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37557887400"},{"name":"Robert M.

When used by the numerical analyst to debug the solver, the ability for the imagery to precisely reflect the data is critical. In practice, the investigator interactively selects from a palette of visualization tools to construct a scene that can answer a query of the data. This is effective as long as the implicit contract of image quality between the individual and the visualization system is upheld. OpenGL rendering of scientific visualizations has worked remarkably well for exploratory visualization for most solver results. This is due to the consistency between the use of first-order representations in the simulation and the linear assumptions inherent in OpenGL (planar fragments and color-space interpolation). Unfortunately, the contract is broken when the solver discretization is of higher-order. There have been attempts to mitigate this through the use of spatial adaptation and/or texture mapping. These methods do a better job of approximating what the imagery should be but are not exact and tend to be view-dependent. This paper introduces new rendering mechanisms that specifically deal with the kinds of native data generated by high-order finite element solvers. The exploratory visualization tools are reassessed and cast in this system with the focus on image accuracy. This is accomplished in a GPU setting to ensure interactivity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06064943.pdf","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Based Interactive Cut-Surface Extraction From High-Order Finite Element Fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Data visualization","Linear approximation","Tensile stress","Image color analysis","Graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","finite element analysis","image processing","ray tracing","rendering (computer graphics)","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-based interactive cut-surface extraction","high-order finite element field","GPU-based ray-tracing system","interactive visualization","3D simulation","high-order finite element method","imagery","visualization tool","image quality","visualization system","OpenGL rendering","scientific visualization","texture mapping","image accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-order finite elements","spectral/hp elements","cut-plane extraction","GPU-based root-finding","GPU ray-tracing","cutsurface extraction."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Based Interactive Cut-Surface Extraction From High-Order Finite Element Fields","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359376","pubMedId":"22034297","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Based Interactive Cut-Surface Extraction From High-Order Finite Element Fields","sourcePdf":"ttg2011121803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076984S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6064943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6064948,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Correa","affiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Correa","id":"37282925900"},{"name":"Peter Lindstrom","affiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lindstrom","id":"37269320000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6064948","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Robustness","Data mining","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation","gradient methods","graph theory","mesh generation","pattern clustering","sampling methods","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsely sampled data","sparse irregular sampling","high dimensional signal","topological decomposition","topological clustering","gradient estimation","neighborhood strategy","k-nearest neighbor","neighborhood connection","spurious connection","Delaunay triangulation","empty region graph","neighborhood-based analysis tool","topological decomposition","neighborhood graph","high dimensional data set","low dimensional data set","scalar function visualization","robust data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neighborhood graphs","topology","sparsely sampled data."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064948","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06064948.pdf","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Robust Topology of Sparsely Sampled Data","abstract":"Sparse, irregular sampling is becoming a necessity for reconstructing large and high-dimensional signals. However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods \u2212 a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time. We describe the implications of our work in the analysis and visualization of scalar functions, and provide general strategies for computing and applying our neighborhood graphs towards robust data analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064948/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359381","pubMedId":"22034302","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Towards Robust Topology of Sparsely Sampled Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Robust Topology of Sparsely Sampled Data","sourcePdf":"ttg2011121852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045301S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6064948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6064988,"authors":[{"name":"Jessica Hullman","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Hullman","id":"38016234500"},{"name":"Nick Diakopoulos","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Diakopoulos","id":"37591165700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6064988","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5458},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064988","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Rhetoric","Semiotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visualization rhetoric","framing effects","communicative information visualization","exploratory information visualization","end-user interpretation","political messaging","decision making","literary study","narrative information visualization","critical theory","semiotics","journalism","political theory","design tactics","visual representation","textual annotation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rhetoric","narrative visualization","framing effects","semiotics","denotation","connotation."]}],"abstract":"Narrative visualizations combine conventions of communicative and exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story.

We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels-the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity-and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.255","startPage":"2231","endPage":"2240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06064988.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12359421","pubMedId":"22034342","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6064988/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2011122231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07727S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6064926","articleId":"6064988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6064996,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bostock","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bostock","id":"37591067400"},{"name":"Vadim Ogievetsky","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Ogievetsky","id":"38016292400"},{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heer","id":"37550791300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6064996","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1339,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":7827},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Cascading style sheets","Image color analysis","Debugging","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer animation","data visualisation","document handling","user interfaces","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven documents","representation-transparent approach","Web visualization","toolkit-specific abstraction","native representation","standard document object model","document elements","dynamic transforms","representational transparency","animation","scene graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","user interfaces","toolkits","2D graphics."]}],"abstract":"Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06064996.pdf","startPage":"2301","endPage":"2309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D\u00b3 Data-Driven Documents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"D\u00b3 Data-Driven Documents","volume":"17","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6064996/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359428","pubMedId":"22034350","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6064996/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D\u00b3 Data-Driven Documents","sourcePdf":"ttg2011122301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113278S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"1339","xplore-issue":"6064926","articleId":"6064996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6065008,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Cui","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37391623900"},{"name":"Shixia Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Shixia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406039100"},{"name":"Li Tan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Tan","id":"38024441100"},{"name":"Conglei Shi","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Conglei","lastName":"Shi","id":"38019494400"},{"name":"Yangqiu Song","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Yangqiu","lastName":"Song","id":"37407140300"},{"name":"Zekai Gao","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Zekai","lastName":"Gao","id":"38023993900"},{"name":"Huamin Qu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Huamin","lastName":"Qu","id":"37272637300"},{"name":"Xin Tong","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Tong","id":"37394723000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6065008","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":199,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":3337},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065008","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text analysis","Data visualization","Tag clouds","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data visualisation","feature extraction","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TextFlow","topics evolution","visualization technique","topic mining technique","three-level feature extraction","topic evolution trend","critical event","keyword correlation","coherent visualization","convey complex relationships","topic mining model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text visualization","Topic evolution","Hierarchical Dirichlet process","Critical event."]}],"abstract":"Understanding how topics evolve in text data is an important and challenging task.

Modern data visualization problems in the domains of news analysis, network security and financial applications, require visual analysis of incremental data, which poses specific challenges that are normally not solved by static visualizations. The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest. We demonstrate the validity of our techniques by applying them on incremental data coming from online news streams in different time frames.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06065015.pdf","startPage":"2479","endPage":"2488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065015/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12359447","pubMedId":"22034369","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065015/","volume":"17","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"ttg2011122479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116001S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6064926","articleId":"6065015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6065026,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Cao","id":"37604309600"},{"name":"David Gotz","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of the technique, especially in support of complex multidimensional cluster analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6064926/06065026.pdf","startPage":"2581","endPage":"2590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6065026/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359458","pubMedId":"22034380","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters","sourcePdf":"ttg2011122581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086438S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6064926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6064926","articleId":"6065026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6065048,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Amanatidis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Computer Technology, TEI of Western Macedonia, Kastoria, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Amanatidis","id":"38017809700"},{"name":"Michael Dossis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Computer Technology, TEI of Western Macedonia, Kastoria, Greece"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Dossis","id":"37547922700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-962-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6065048","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Cellular neural networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Image edge detection","Computers","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","coprocessors","edge detection","hardware description languages","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioral synthesis tool","cellular neural network","image processing applications","hardware implementation","CCC HLS framework","RTL VHDL implementations","ADA specifications","RTL micro-architectures","edge-detection","half toning","morphological operations","custom coprocessor compilation","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["behavioral synthesis","high-level synthesis","ASIC-FPGA design","cellular neural networks","edge detection","halftoning","image morphology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065048","abstract":"In this contribution, behavioral synthesis tools are used for hardware implementation of a cellular neural network with the ability to accomplish image processing tasks in real time.

The tight closed-form expression of the proposed scheduling system for outage probability is derived. We also present asymptotic analysis to quantify diversity order and SNR gain.

Our proposed system transmits duplex data of 480 Mbit/s and 240 Mbit/s in the downlink and uplink directions, respectively at mm-wave frequencies of 25 GHz or 50 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.101711.111794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06065241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.101711.111794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Carrier-Multiplexed Duplex 64-QAM Radio-over-Fiber Transmission for Distributed Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Carrier-Multiplexed Duplex 64-QAM Radio-over-Fiber Transmission for Distributed Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425094","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6065241/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Carrier-Multiplexed Duplex 64-QAM Radio-over-Fiber Transmission for Distributed Antennas","sourcePdf":"1368-cl1112-ghafoor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078514S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6104419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6104419","articleId":"6065241","onlineDate":"31 October 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6065251,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This is partly due to the complexity of the script, which has more than 800 unique ligatures. In addition, segmentation and recognition of individual characters often becomes difficult due to the writing style as well as degradations in the print. For these reasons, robust OCRs are non existent for Hindi. Therefore, Hindi document repositories are not amenable to indexing and retrieval. In this paper, we propose a scheme for retrieving relevant Hindi documents in response to a query word. This approach uses BLSTM neural networks. Designed to take contextual information into account, these networks can handle word images that can not be robustly segmented into individual characters. By zoning the Hindi words, we simplify the problem and obtain high retrieval rates. Our simplification suits the retrieval problem, while it does not apply to recognition. Our scalable retrieval scheme avoids explicit recognition of characters. An experimental evaluation on a dataset of word images gathered from two complete books demonstrates good accuracy even in the presence of printing variations and degradations.

The manual labeling of the data by a human expert is a tedious and costly procedure. In this paper we propose an efficient and low-cost semi-automatic labeling system for character datasets. First, the data is represented in different abstraction levels, which is clustered after in an unsupervised manner. The different clusters are labeled by the human experts and finally an unanimity voting is considered to decide if a label is accepted or not. The experimental results prove that labeling only less than 0.5% of the training data is sufficient to achieve 86.21% recognition rate for a brand new script (Lampung) and 94.81% for the MNIST benchmark dataset, considering only a K-nearest neighbor classifier for recognition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.60","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065315.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-supervised Ensemble Learning Approach for Character Labeling with Minimal Human Effort","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-supervised Ensemble Learning Approach for Character Labeling with Minimal Human Effort","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6065315/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345178","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065315/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-supervised Ensemble Learning Approach for Character Labeling with Minimal Human Effort","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4520a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07497S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6065320,"authors":[{"name":"Lobna Haddad","affiliation":["REGIM: REsearch Group on Intelligent Machines, National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS), University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Lobna","lastName":"Haddad","id":"38016948900"},{"name":"Tarek M.

The developed adaptation module is added after the recognition system, and its role is to examine the output of the independent system and produce a more correct output vector close to the desired response of the user. To achieve this end, we conceive an adaptation module based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) which is built using an incremental training algorithm. Two adaptation strategies are applied for adaptation module training: increase the number of new hidden units and adjust the parameters of the nearest unit (weights and location of center) using the standard descent gradient. This new architecture is evaluated by the adaptation of two recognition systems, one for digit recognition and one for alphanumeric character recognition. The results, reported according to the cumulative error, show that the adaptation module (AM) leads to decreasing the classification error and is capable of fast adaptation to the users handwriting. Moreover, results are compared with those carried out using the weights updating strategy of the nearest center apart from the addition of new units. In fact, the adaptation module decreases an average of 50% the error rate with standard recognition systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.65","startPage":"284","endPage":"288","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065320.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of On-line Recognition Systems Using a RBF-Neural Network Based Writer Adaptation Module","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Training","Databases","Vectors","Neurons","Text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","radial basis function networks","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online recognition system","RBF-neural network","radial basis function network","writer adaptation module","user response","incremental training algorithm","standard descent gradient method","digit recognition","alphanumeric character recognition","user handwriting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Writer Adaptation","Module Adaptation","Incremental learning of RBF-NN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of On-line Recognition Systems Using a RBF-Neural Network Based Writer Adaptation Module","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065320/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345183","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of On-line Recognition Systems Using a RBF-Neural Network Based Writer Adaptation Module","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4520a284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08745S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6065331,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37960905500"},{"name":"Michael Blumenstein","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Blumenstein","id":"37270157400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1350-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-5363"}],"articleNumber":"6065331","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"abstract":"Similar to many other pattern recognition problems, feature extraction contributes significantly to the overall performance of an off-line signature verification system.

A layout entity -- such as letters of the text, initials or headings -- is composed of a set of characteristic segments or structures, which is dissimilar for distinct classes in the manuscripts under consideration. This fact is exploited in order to segment a manuscript page into homogeneous regions. Historical documents traditionally involve challenges such as uneven writing support and varying shapes of characters, fluctuating text lines, changing scripts and writing styles, and variance in the layout itself. Hence, a part-based detection of layout entities is proposed using a multi-stage algorithm for the localization of the entities, based on interest points. Results show that the proposed method is able to locate initials, headings and text areas in ancient manuscripts containing stains, tears and partially faded-out ink sufficiently well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6065363/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345225","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Layout Analysis for Historical Manuscripts Using Sift Features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout Analysis for Historical Manuscripts Using Sift Features","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4520a508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05485S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6065369,"authors":[{"name":"Ray Smith","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, USA"],"firstName":"Ray","lastName":"Smith","id":"37615898800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1350-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-5363"}],"articleNumber":"6065369","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065369","abstract":"Although large language models are used in speech recognition and machine translation applications, OCR systems are \"far behind\"\u009d in their use of language models.

Because HMM is still not a common method in this field nowadays, in this paper, we will introduce a novel algorithm using HMM for the segmentation issue above.

Then we used a three-stage method to recognize the GUs. At the first stage, all the GUs are classified into nine groups by decision tree using three features of the GUs. At the second stage, the GUs in each group are classified individually by five independent BP Neutral Networks whose inputs are other five feature vectors of the GUs. At the last stage, the five results of each GU group from the above five classifiers are combined to provide the final recognized result.

Subgraph spotting is a very interesting research problem for various application domains where the use of a relational data structure is mandatory. Our proposed method accomplishes subgraph spotting through graph embedding. We achieve automatic indexation of a graph repository during off-line learning phase, where we (i) break the graphs into 2-node sub graphs (a.k.a. cliques of order 2), which are primitive building-blocks of a graph, (ii) embed the 2-node sub graphs into feature vectors by employing our recently proposed explicit graph embedding technique, (iii) cluster the feature vectors in classes by employing a classic agglomerative clustering technique, (iv) build an index for the graph repository and (v) learn a Bayesian network classifier. The subgraph spotting is achieved during the on-line querying phase, where we (i) break the query graph into 2-node sub graphs, (ii) embed them into feature vectors, (iii) employ the Bayesian network classifier for classifying the query 2-node sub graphs and (iv) retrieve the respective graphs by looking-up in the index of the graph repository. The graphs containing all query 2-node sub graphs form the set of result graphs for the query. Finally, we employ the adjacency matrix of each result graph along with a score function, for spotting the query graph in it. The proposed subgraph spotting method is equally applicable to a wide range of domains, offering ease of query by example (QBE) and granularity of focused retrieval. Experimental results are presented for graphs generated from two repositories of electronic and architectural document images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345297","htmlLink":"/document/6065435/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Subgraph Spotting through Explicit Graph Embedding: An Application to Content Spotting in Graphic Document Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subgraph Spotting through Explicit Graph Embedding: An Application to Content Spotting in Graphic Document Images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4520a870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040753S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6065468,"authors":[{"name":"Asif Shahab","affiliation":["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Asif","lastName":"Shahab","id":"38016698600"},{"name":"Faisal Shafait","affiliation":["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Shafait","id":"37284121200"},{"name":"Andreas Dengel","affiliation":["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Dengel","id":"37330869800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1350-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-5363"}],"articleNumber":"6065468","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Bayesian methods","Image segmentation","Text recognition","Image recognition","Optical character recognition software","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","character sets","image colour analysis","image segmentation","indexing","object detection","optical character recognition","rendering (computer graphics)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian approach","photo time-stamp recognition","URL","meta information","automatic indexing","attention-based model","visual saliency","overlaid text extraction","image rendering","Bayesian framework","time-stamp detection","time-stamp segmentation","overall object recall","text segmented binarized image","OCR system","font styles","time-stamp color"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["overlaid text detection/recognition","photo time-stamp detection/recognition","visual saliency","Bayesian model for text detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065468","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065468.pdf","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Approach to Photo Time-Stamp Recognition","abstract":"Time-stamps and URLs overlaid artificially on images add useful meta information which can be used for automatic indexing of images and videos.

Our model of visual saliency is based on a Bayesian framework and works very well for the task of time-stamp detection and segmentation as is evident by overall object recall of 80% and precision of 70%. Our method produces a clean text segmented binarized image, which can be used for recognition directly by an OCR system.

The high degree of intraclass variation along with the presence of clutter makes accurate recognition difficult, yet the semantic information conveyed by sections of text within images or graphics makes their recognition an important problem. Previous work has shown that, on the two most commonly used datasets of such characters, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors have outperformed other methods. In this work we consider two extensions of the HOG descriptor to include features at multiple scales, and evaluate their performance using characters taken from images and graphics. We demonstrate that, by combining pairs of oriented gradients at different scales, it's possible to achieve an increase in performance of 12.4% and 5.6% on the two datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.219","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1089","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptors for Robust Character Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptors for Robust Character Recognition","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065477/","accessionNumber":"12345339","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptors for Robust Character Recognition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4520b085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041337S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6065484,"authors":[{"name":"Akhtar Jamil","affiliation":["Department of Computer Software Engineering, National University of Sciences &Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Akhtar","lastName":"Jamil","id":"37947929800"},{"name":"Imran Siddiqi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Software Engineering, National University of Sciences &Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Siddiqi","id":"37949353600"},{"name":"Fahim Arif","affiliation":["Department of Computer Software Engineering, National University of Sciences &Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Fahim","lastName":"Arif","id":"37295177600"},{"name":"Ahsen Raza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Software Engineering, National University of Sciences &Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ahsen","lastName":"Raza","id":"38182208600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1350-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-5363"}],"articleNumber":"6065484","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Indexing","Text recognition","Image segmentation","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","filtering theory","gradient methods","natural language processing","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge based features","artificial Urdu text localization","video images","content based video indexing","content based video retrieval","digital media","audio visual content","semantic indexing","gradient magnitude","run length smoothing algorithm","RLSA","edge density filter","noise elimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Urdu text detection","Gradient edge detection","Run length smoothing alogrithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065484","abstract":"Content-based video indexing and retrieval has become an interesting research area with the tremendous growth in the amount of digital media. In addition to the audio-visual content, text appearing in videos can serve as a powerful tool for semantic indexing and retrieval of videos. This paper proposes a method based on edge-features for horizontally aligned artificial Urdu text detection from video images. The system exploits edge based segmentation to extract textual content from videos. We first find the vertical gradients in the input video image and average the gradient magnitude in a fixed neighborhood of each pixel. The resulting image is binarized and the horizontal run length smoothing algorithm (RLSA) is applied to merge possible text regions. An edge density filter is then applied to eliminate noisy non-text regions. Finally, the candidate regions satisfying certain geometrical constraints are accepted as text regions. The proposed approach evaluated on a data set of 150 video images exhibited promising results.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.226","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1124","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065484.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-Based Features for Localization of Artificial Urdu Text in Video Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Edge-Based Features for Localization of Artificial Urdu Text in Video Images","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065484/","accessionNumber":"12345346","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065484/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-Based Features for Localization of Artificial Urdu Text in Video Images","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"4520b120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102446S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6065245","isNumber":"6065247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6065245","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6065247","articleId":"6065484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6065487,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Claudiu Ciresan","affiliation":["IDSIA, USI/SUPSI, Manno-Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dan Claudiu","lastName":"Ciresan","id":"37888542800"},{"name":"Ueli Meier","affiliation":["IDSIA, USI/SUPSI, Manno-Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ueli","lastName":"Meier","id":"37902697300"},{"name":"Luca Maria Gambardella","affiliation":["IDSIA, USI/SUPSI, Manno-Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luca Maria","lastName":"Gambardella","id":"37270036000"},{"name":"Jurgen Schmidhuber","affiliation":["IDSIA, USI/SUPSI, Manno-Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Schmidhuber","id":"37304241400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1350-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-5363"}],"articleNumber":"6065487","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":236,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":5640},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Committees for Handwritten Character Classification","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6065245/6065247/06065487.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1139","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065247","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2011.229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NIST","Training","Error analysis","Handwriting recognition","Neural networks","Character recognition","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network committees","handwritten character classification","MNIST handwriting recognition benchmark","graphics cards","trained CNN","NIST SD 19","NIST digits","NIST letters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","Graphics Processing Unit","Handwritten Character Recognition","Committee"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065487","abstract":"In 2010, after many years of stagnation, the MNIST handwriting recognition benchmark record dropped from 0.40% error rate to 0.35%.

This emerging trend of achieving energy efficiency in cellular networks is motivating the standardization authorities and network operators to continuously explore future technologies in order to bring improvements in the entire network infrastructure. In this article, we present a brief survey of methods to improve the power efficiency of cellular networks, explore some research issues and challenges and suggest some techniques to enable an energy efficient or \"green\" cellular network. Since base stations consume a maximum portion of the total energy used in a cellular system, we will first provide a comprehensive survey on techniques to obtain energy savings in base stations. Next, we discuss how heterogenous network deployment based on micro, pico and femtocells can be used to achieve this goal. Since cognitive radio and cooperative relaying are undisputed future technologies in this regard, we propose a research vision to make these technologies more energy efficient. Lastly, we explore some broader perspectives in realizing a \"green\" cellular network technology.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.092311.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.092311.00031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6065679/06065681.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Cellular Networks: A Survey, Some Research Issues and Challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Green Cellular Networks: A Survey, Some Research Issues and Challenges","volume":"13","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065681/","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12359787","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Cellular Networks: A Survey, Some Research Issues and Challenges","sourcePdf":"02Hasan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151468S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6065679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"817","xplore-issue":"6065679","articleId":"6065681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6065726,"authors":[{"name":"L.

These systems can accommodate increased users at longer distances potentially at low cost. With the increasing demand for higher bandwidths, current networks may soon require that bit rates upgrade to 100 Gb/s and beyond. However, the traditional on-off-keyed PON cannot be scaled up to such bit rates, as very high-speed opto-electronic devices are required that are still maturing. Therefore, to provide a comprehensive solution to these scalability issues of existing PONs, we propose a spectrally efficient (4 bit/s/Hz) 100 Gb/s long-reach PON based on 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and frequency interleaved directly detected optical orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing. We show that the proposed system may operate effectively over 100 km of single mode fiber with a 1024-way split and a receiver bandwidth of 25 GHz. It is also shown that the system can be provisioned to support even higher numbers of users (e.g., 2048, 4096, etc.) simply by varying the order of QAM with little compromise in bit rates. Moreover, the effects of various link parameters such as laser linewidths, fiber dispersion, filter profiles, etc. are also investigated for proper link dimensioning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable and Spectrally Efficient Long-Reach Optical Access Networks Employing Frequency Interleaved Directly Detected Optical OFDM","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.3.000881","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/6102629/06065726.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.3.000881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","displayDocTitle":"Scalable and Spectrally Efficient Long-Reach Optical Access Networks Employing Frequency Interleaved Directly Detected Optical OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6065726/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12425153","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable and Spectrally Efficient Long-Reach Optical Access Networks Employing Frequency Interleaved Directly Detected Optical OFDM","sourcePdf":"881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074149S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6102629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6102629","articleId":"6065726","onlineDate":"01 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6065727,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Y.

At the same time, for large segments of embedded markets, parameters like cost and performance continue to be as important as reliability. This paper presents a compiler-based methodology for facilitating the design of fault-tolerant embedded systems. The methodology is supported by an infrastructure that permits to easily combine hardware/software soft errors mitigation techniques in order to best satisfy both usual design constraints and dependability requirements. It is based on a generic microprocessor architecture that facilitates the implementation of software-based techniques, providing a uniform isolated-from-target hardening core that allows the automatic generation of protected source code (hardened code). Two case studies are presented. In the first one, several software-based mitigation techniques are implemented and evaluated showing the flexibility of the infrastructure. In the second one, a customized fault tolerant embedded system is designed by combining selective protection on both hardware and software. Several trade-offs among performance, code size, reliability, and hardware costs have been explored. Results show the applicability of the approach. Among the developed software-based mitigation techniques, a novel selective version of the well known SWIFT-R is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2011.54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/6134781/06065735.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2011.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6134781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compiler-Directed Soft Error Mitigation for Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Compiler-Directed Soft Error Mitigation for Embedded Systems","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2012","accessionNumber":"12486951","htmlLink":"/document/6065735/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compiler-Directed Soft Error Mitigation for Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"ttq2012020159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124997S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6134781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6134781","articleId":"6065735","onlineDate":"01 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":6065747,"authors":[{"name":"Shekoofeh Saboktakin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6214970/6065747/6065747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shekoofeh Saboktakin (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. degree from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in September 2007 and May 2011, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","She is currently a research associate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba.

At the present time, a commercial PMSG wind turbine primarily makes use of a passive rectifier followed by an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter. Although a PMSG wind turbine with two back-to-back voltage source IGBT converters is considered more efficient, it has not been widely adopted by the wind power industry. This paper investigates both the conventional and a novel vector control mechanism for a PMSG wind turbine that has two side-by-side voltage source pulsewidth modulation converters. The proposed approach is based on a direct-current vector control mechanism for control of both machine- and grid-side converters of a PMSG wind turbine. Then, an optimal control strategy is developed for integrated control of PMSG maximum power extraction, reactive power, and grid voltage support controls. A transient system simulation using SimPowerSystem is built to investigate the performance of the conventional and proposed control techniques for the PMSG wind turbine under steady and gusty wind conditions. This paper shows that when using the direct-current vector control structure, a PMSG system has excellent performance in various aspects.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2174254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06065760.pdf","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2174254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Direct-Current Vector Control of Direct-Driven PMSG Wind Turbines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065760/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Direct-Current Vector Control of Direct-Driven PMSG Wind Turbines","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12571275","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6065760/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Direct-Current Vector Control of Direct-Driven PMSG Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2174254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106725S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"283","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6065760","onlineDate":"01 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6065763,"authors":[{"name":"Lindsay V.

This solution generates models of the system, assesses the models' performance in detecting faults, and then uses the models and their performance to detect anomalies in new event streams. A new resource-based Petri net formalism is introduced to model these types of systems. The model generation uses an algorithm based on workflow mining to generate resource-based models.

The electronic properties of these defects are consistent with the increases in threshold voltage and 1/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n noise in proton irradiation experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2170433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6093861/06065780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2170433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093861","startPage":"2918","endPage":"2924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation-Induced Defect Evolution and Electrical Degradation of AlGaN/GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-Induced Defect Evolution and Electrical Degradation of AlGaN/GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6065780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408872","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6065780/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-Induced Defect Evolution and Electrical Degradation of AlGaN/GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistors","sourcePdf":"tns-puzyrev-2170433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148933S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6093861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6093861","articleId":"6065780","onlineDate":"01 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":6065842,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Conventional OFDM system utilizes cyclic prefix to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI), however it leads to spectral inefficiency. WPT is used in the paper instead of conventional DFT to improve the performance of OFDM system.

When the initial frequency equals to the frequency deviation during a half symbol duration, and the chirp rate is negative slope, the output of multipath signal in matched filter has the same phase or the reverse phase as that of direct signal, the impact of multipath signal on BER performance of demodulation is alleviated.

The flight experiments under strong wind show the UAV could track the generalized landing trajectory robustly and touch the ground with high precision and security.","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066471","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06066471.pdf","startPage":"1965","endPage":"1970","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated landing control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6066471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated landing control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12435978","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6066471/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated landing control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E30697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060887S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6066471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6066484,"authors":[{"name":"Jinlei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jinlei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406673400"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37350692600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6066484","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6066484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Table lookup","Iterative decoding","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Logic gates","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["min-sum unit","multinormalized-factors","LPDC decoder","equivalent gate count"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","nomalized min-sum","multiplier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066484","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06066484.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","startPage":"910","endPage":"913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Min-sum unit with multi-normalized-factors for LPDC decoder","abstract":"A min-sum unit with multi-normalized-factors which is used in LDPC decoder is proposed.

Besides, with the increases of scheduling users, much larger capability and diversity gain of the system can be obtained. As for a scheduling algorithm, exhaustive method is an approach that can get the largest capability of the system by multi-user scheduling. However, this algorithm is quite complex and usually brings huge workload to a base station with multiple antennas, hence the cost of operation to a base station has substantial increased. In this paper, we propose one simple user selection algorithm with low complexity.

In addition, under the same reconstruction conditions, IANN-CS algorithm has a good compromise between reconstruction precision and convergence rate, what is more, the observation value needed in ANN CS and IANN-CS algorithm are less than which in the existing reconstruction algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm based on artificial neural network","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066532","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06066532.pdf","startPage":"1860","endPage":"1863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6066532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6066532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An improved compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm based on artificial neural network","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6066532/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12436039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm based on artificial neural network","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E36645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041174S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6066532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6066535,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Lianjuan","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lianjuan","id":"38014670500"},{"name":"Bao Jingfu","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bao","lastName":"Jingfu","id":"37547719000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6066535","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Stability analysis","Circuit stability","Noise figure","Negative feedback","Radio frequency","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","high electron mobility transistors","low noise amplifiers","microstrip lines","ultra wideband technology","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-wideband low noise amplifier design","compact design","unconditionally stable amplifier","wide-band characteristics","matching mechanism","lumped-elements","microstrip lines","FHX35LG","PHEMT","ATF-54143","negative feedback technique","frequency band","software ADS","matching network","covered band","gain-flatness","noise figure","linear output power","frequency 0.5 GHz to 6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low noise","ultra wide-band","negative feedback","wideband matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6066535","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06066535.pdf","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 0.5\u20136GHz ultra-wideband low noise amplifier design","abstract":"In this letter, the design of a compact, two-stage, low noise, unconditionally stable, amplifier from 0.5 to 6 GHz is discussed.

Using 64 point FFT with radix-2, decimation in time (DIT) algorithm as the design objective, only an adder block and a multiplier block with pipeline structure and floating point arithmetic are adopted applying this design method. According to different classifications of twiddle factor, corresponding butterfly operations can be implemented to save the total calculation time to only 1100 clock cycles for 64 point FFT. In addition, multiple FFT processor blocks can be integrated for parallel computing to achieve higher data throughput rate. Compared with some other designs of 64 point FFT, the final results show that the proposed design has better real-time performance and lower system level complexity with the same amount of resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06066737.pdf","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1399","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6066737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and realization of small point FFT processor based on twiddle factor classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Pipelines","Engines","Adders","Timing","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","fast Fourier transforms","floating point arithmetic","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small point FFT processor","twiddle factor classification","fast Fourier transform processor","power consumption","decimation in time algorithm","DIT algorithm","pipeline structure","floating point arithmetic","twiddle factor","parallel computing","digital signal processing","DSP cores"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fast Fourier transform (FFT)","radix-2","decimation in time (DIT)","twiddle factor","field programmable gate array (FPGA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6066737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and realization of small point FFT processor based on twiddle factor classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6066737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403101","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and realization of small point FFT processor based on twiddle factor classification","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E54643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081388S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6066737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6066742,"authors":[{"name":"Gong Kexian","affiliation":["Institute of Zhengzhou Information science and technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gong","lastName":"Kexian","id":"38014725900"},{"name":"Dong Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Zhengzhou Information science and technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38019671600"},{"name":"Ge Lindong","affiliation":["Institute of Zhengzhou Information science and technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Lindong","id":"37426184400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6066742","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Synchronization","Finite impulse response filter","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Switches","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","quadrature amplitude modulation","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing","fractionally-spaced equalization","QAM signal","Gardner algorithm","CMA-MMA equalization","channel aberration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind equalization","fractionally-spaced","MMA","timing"]}],"abstract":"A new joint algorithm between timing and fractionally-spaced equalization is proposed.

Firstly, thermal spreading resistance is calculated, and then thermal simulation is done using finite element method. Influencing factors in thermal spreading are analyzed by these two methods and the results are matched quite well. An optimal thickness of heat sink is found, and the minimal thermal resistance of heat sink is attained in this thickness value. The optimal thickness decreases after increasing area of heat source. In flipchip LED, thermal resistance decreases after increasing area of Au bumps and the thickness of PN junction available at the present technology. At the same Au usage, reduce the area of each bump and increase the number of bumps could effectively decrease thermal resistance of PN junction and have good temperature evenness.

CMOS image sensors gave birth to the low-cost, high-volume camera phone market and are being adopted for various high-end applications. The backside illumination technique has significant advantages over the front-side illumination due to separation of the optical path from the metal interconnects. Wafer bonding plays a key role in manufacturing backside illuminated sensors. The cost-effective integration of miniaturized cameras in various handheld devices becomes realized through the introduction of CMOS image sensor modules or camera modules manufactured with wafer-level processing and integration techniques. We developed various technologies enabling wafer-level processing and integration, such as (a) wafer-to-wafer permanent bonding with oxide or polymer layers for manufacturing backside illuminated sensor wafers, (b) wafer-level lens molding and stacking based on UV imprint lithography for making wafer-level optics, (c) conformal coating of various photoresists within high aspect ratio through-silicon vias, and (d) advanced backside lithography for various metallization processes in wafer-level packaging. Those techniques pave the way to the future growth of the digital imaging industry by improving the electrical and optical aspects of devices as well as the module manufacturability.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2011.6067039","publicationTitle":"2011 12th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology and High Density Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology and High Density Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056740/6066691/06067039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2011.6067039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066691","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS image sensor wafer-level packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6067039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CMOS image sensor wafer-level packaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6067039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12355522","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6067039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS image sensor wafer-level packaging","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"K10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05341S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056740","isNumber":"6066691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056740","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6066691","articleId":"6067039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6067547,"authors":[{"name":"Han Mei","affiliation":["Zhejiang Business Technology Institute, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Mei","id":"38020652800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6067547","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Testing","Wind turbines","Transmitters","Wind power generation","Wind speed","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","data acquisition","power engineering computing","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design","testing system","small grid-off wind turbine generator","LabVIEW","Mongolia","data acquisition","antiinterference","wind energy","virtual instruments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["grid-off wind turbine generator","virtual instruments","LabVIEW","testing system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6067547","abstract":"Base on the analysis of the existing test systems for the small grid-off wind turbine generator, a new test system considering the weather conditions of Inner Mongolia is proposed based on LabVIEW..

Frequent and unnecessary handover is another problem for hierarchical network environment that must be optimized to improve the performance of macrocell/femtocell integrated network.

The simulation results are accurate, and prove that this method can meet the need of improving the accuracy of the correction of bad data and enhancing the performance of the network.","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067574","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1897","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06067574.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of genetic algorithm-neural network for the correction of bad data in power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Convergence","Genetics","Training","Biological neural networks","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system security","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","bad data correction","power system stability","power system security","BP neural network","Kunming power grid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","BP neural network","the correction of bad data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6067574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic algorithm-neural network for the correction of bad data in power system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6067574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403170","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic algorithm-neural network for the correction of bad data in power system","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E64424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035035S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6067574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6067586,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Yin","id":"38023946300"},{"name":"Xingcheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Xingcheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292949900"},{"name":"Chulong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Chulong","lastName":"Liang","id":"38022395800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6067586","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Algorithm design and analysis","Niobium","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","parity check codes","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cycle entropy","low-density parity-check codes","parity-check matrix","nonbinary elements","randomly-constructed nonbinary LDPC cycle codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonbinary LDPC cycle code","cycle entropy","girth"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the design of a type of low- density parity-check (LDPC) codes called cycle codes whose parity-check matrix have exactly weight-2 columns.

Dynamic block prefetching can be used in combination with other optimized methods, such as search branch unwinding. This approach can be used to improve the performance in general-purpose processors which own hardware cache and heterogeneous acceleration cores which not provide hardware supported memory coherence or have limited on chip storage.

The faults make circuit's output signal delay. This paper proposed an effective test generation algorithm for the crosstalk fault. Kernighan-Lin-Fiduccia-Mattheyses(KLFM) method is used to cut the circuit into two parts including the left and right parts. For the right part, the fault can be propagated to the output using neural networks method, the test patterns obtained by the method become a constraint condition; for the left part, a crosstalk fault equation can be obtained. The patterns that satisfy the constraint condition and make the delay equation have maximal value are the test generation patterns for the crosstalk fault. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm's fault coverage can reach 96% and the algorithm's test generation time is less than that of other references.","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067669","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06067669.pdf","startPage":"2628","endPage":"2631","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital circuit crosstalk delay faults test generation based on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6067669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Digital circuit crosstalk delay faults test generation based on neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12422989","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6067669/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital circuit crosstalk delay faults test generation based on neural networks","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E72887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067577S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6067669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6067671,"authors":[{"name":"Ruan Wei-hua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Institute of Industry Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ruan","lastName":"Wei-hua","id":"38301825600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6067671","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Software","Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Sequential circuits","Digital signal processing","Cyclones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative logarithmic function","FPGA chip EP2C5T144","QuartusII software","sequential circuit","interpolation method","fast clock frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NLF","FPGA","Synthesis","Simulation","Hardware Test"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the realization of the Negative Logarithmic Function based on the FPGA chip EP2C5T144 by QuartusII software.

In this DPDTS, DDS algorithm is used in frequency control, while soft microprocessor MicroBlaze is instanced for user interface control. Time delay is separated into wide range coarse delay and narrow range fine delay. Wide range coarse delay is achieved through counter, while narrow range fine delay is achieved through cascaded absolute delay element called IODELAYE1 in FPGA. Besides, the DPDTS, with the ability of automatic clock switch, can protect the controlled laser system.

In this design, we use LDMOS devices with a power ratio of 1:1:1, The radial stubs are utilized in the dc bias network to increase the bandwidth. The power added efficiency of the proposed three-stage Doherty PA has been maintained 47% at an average output power of 46 dBm, which is 9 dB backed-off from the peak output power of 55 dBm. The simulation results clearly show that the three-stage Doherty is an efficient architecture among the various Doherty PAs, especially for a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6067756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6067756/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12423076","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization design of a broadband three-stage Doherty power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization design of a broadband three-stage Doherty power amplifier","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E74979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049229S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6067756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6067777,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University Yantai, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37960490300"},{"name":"Guo-Sheng Rui","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University Yantai, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Sheng","lastName":"Rui","id":"37926477400"},{"name":"Jun Miao","affiliation":["Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Miao","id":"37087078201"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0321-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0320-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0319-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6067777","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Amplitude estimation","Interference","Accuracy","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","antennas","minimum shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic spectrum-based algorithm","single antenna mixture","non-cooperative communication field","amplitude algorithm","single antenna MSK mixing signals","cyclic spectrum","high-intensity spectral lines","fast cyclic spectrum","amplitude estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MSK mixing signals","Amplitude estimation","Cyclic spectrum","Spectral-line illegibility","Single antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6067777","doi":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECC.2011.6067777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066262","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6036130/6066262/06067777.pdf","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic spectrum-based algorithm of estimating amplitudes for single antenna mixture","abstract":"Aimed at non-cooperative communication field an amplitude algorithm is proposed for single antenna MSK mixing signals.

Moreover, another two input dividing ratio are discussed, obtaining the power additional efficiency and power gain respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6067919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6067919/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12402954","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 460MHz three-stage Doherty power amplifier with uneven power driving","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 460MHz three-stage Doherty power amplifier with uneven power driving","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"E97808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040029S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6036130","isNumber":"6066262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036130","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6066262","articleId":"6067919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6068196,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6110251/6068196/6068196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Wu received the B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2006, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Minnesota in 2010.

A heavily coded system corresponds to a low transmission rate with few ARQ re-transmissions, whereas lighter coding corresponds to a higher transmitted rate but more retransmissions. The optimum packet error probability, where optimum refers to the maximization of the average successful throughput, is derived and is shown to be a decreasing function of the average signal-to-noise ratio and of the channel diversity order. A general conclusion of the work is that the optimum error probability is quite large (e.g., 10% or larger) for reasonable channel parameters, and that operating at a very small error probability can lead to a significantly reduced throughput. This conclusion holds even when a number of practical ARQ considerations, such as delay constraints and acknowledgement feedback errors, are taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102011.100152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102011.100152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06068196.pdf","startPage":"3363","endPage":"3374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding versus ARQ in Fading Channels: How Reliable Should the PHY Be?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coding versus ARQ in Fading Channels: How Reliable Should the PHY Be?","volume":"59","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068196/","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425637","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068196/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding versus ARQ in Fading Channels: How Reliable Should the PHY Be?","sourcePdf":"3363-tc1112-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123729S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6068196","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6068197,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"38007473700"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao","id":"37283006000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6068197","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2288},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Optimization","OFDM","Throughput","Joints","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","combinatorial mathematics","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay assignment","optimal channel assignment","OFDM-based multirelay multipair two-way communication networks","radio resource utilization","wireless relay network","multiple user pairs","bidirectional communications","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing transmission","subcarrier pairing","subcarrier allocation","throughput maximization","relay selection","combinatorial optimization problem","maximum weighted bipartite matching problem","relay nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relaying","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","subcarrier pairing","graph theory","maximum weighted bipartite matching (MWBM)"]}],"abstract":"Efficient utilization of radio resources in wireless networks is crucial and has been investigated extensively.

Our analysis shows that the cooperative diversity gain has different characteristics from that in non-CR systems since the transmit power of a secondary transmitter is limited by the interference power constraint. If a fixed interference power constraint is imposed, the cooperative diversity gain is lost regardless of the number of relays even if peak transmit power grows to infinity. We analyze the critical value of peak transmit power beyond which increasing peak transmit power does not help in improving the outage probability.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive estimation algorithm to estimate Doppler shifts in a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) radio system with multiple Doppler subpaths. By modeling doubly selective channels using a basis expansion model (BEM), an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based adaptive estimation method is developed to extract accurate Doppler shift information. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis is conducted to study the performance bound of the proposed estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated Doppler shift results, a frequency domain equalizer (FDE) based receiver architecture is developed to exploit Doppler diversity in the frequency domain. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate that this receiver architecture features a low complexity while still achieving a good performance compared with traditional CDMA receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102011.090300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6149856/06068203.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.102011.090300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Adaptive Frequency Domain Estimation of Doppler Shifts with CRLB Analysis for CDMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"EM-Based Adaptive Frequency Domain Estimation of Doppler Shifts with CRLB Analysis for CDMA Systems","volume":"60","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527263","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068203/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-Based Adaptive Frequency Domain Estimation of Doppler Shifts with CRLB Analysis for CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"198-tc1201-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112757S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6149856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6149856","articleId":"6068203","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6068220,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Fei Mao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environment and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun-Fei","lastName":"Mao","id":"37592613100"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environment and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292996400"},{"name":"Run Xiong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environment and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Run","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37709304300"},{"name":"Hai-Jian Geng","affiliation":["China SatelliteMaritime Tracking and Control Department, Jiangyin, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Jian","lastName":"Geng","id":"38242832100"},{"name":"Ji-Zhen Tang","affiliation":["China SatelliteMaritime Tracking and Control Department, Jiangyin, China"],"firstName":"Ji-Zhen","lastName":"Tang","id":"38238172700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6068220","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Periodic structures","Reflection","Numerical stability","Stability analysis","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCS-FDTD algorithm","periodic structures","finite-difference time-domain method","periodic boundary condition","stability condition","Sherman-Morrison formula","nontridiagonal linear systems","ADI-FDTD method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","periodic structure","weakly conditional"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the weakly conditional technique is applied to the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, called WCS-FDTD in short.

A centralized formulation is considered first and then its distributed counterpart, in which agents require knowledge only of their neighbors' states for the controller implementation.

Between April 26 and May 9, 2010, an airborne campaign with the L-band radiometer EMIRAD-2 was carried out within one SMOS pixel (44 \u00d7 44 km) in the Skjern River Catchment, Denmark. Concurrently, ground sampling was conducted within three 2 \u00d7 2 km patches (EMIRAD footprint size) of differing land cover. By means of this data set, the objective of this study is to present the validation of SMOS L1C brightness temperatures \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n of the selected node. Data is stepwise compared from point via EMIRAD to SMOS scale. From ground soil moisture samples, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n's are pointwise estimated through the L-band microwave emission of the biosphere model using land cover specific model settings. These \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n's are patchwise averaged and compared with EMIRAD \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n's. A simple uncertainty assessment by means of a set of model runs with the most influencing parameters varied within a most likely interval results in a considerable spread of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n's (5-20 K). However, for each land cover class, a combination of parameters could be selected to bring modeled and EMIRAD data in good agreement. Thereby, replacing the Dobson dielectric mixing model with the Mironov model decreases the overall RMSE from 11.5 K to 3.8 K. Similarly, EMIRAD data averaged at SMOS scale and corresponding SMOS \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TB</i>\n 's show good accordance on the single day where comparison is not prevented by strong radio-frequency interference (RFI) (May 2, avg.

While the advantages of solid data sets of high spatial coverage and density throughout spatial scales for SMOS validation could be clearly demonstrated, small temporal variability in soil moisture conditions and RFI contamination throughout the campaign limited the extent of the validation work. Further attempts over longer time frames are planned by means of soil moisture network data as well as studies on the impacts of organic layers under natural vegetation and higher open water fractions at surrounding grid nodes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil moisture","Heating","Minerals","Agriculture","Vegetation mapping","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moisture","remote sensing","soil","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SMOS brightness temperature","HOBE airborne campaign","Western Denmark","Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission","global surface soil moisture field","temporal resolution","water management","climate prediction","AD 2010 04 26 to 05 10","EMIRAD-2","Skjern River Catchment","uncertainty assessment","Dobson dielectric mixing model","Mironov model","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airborne campaign","L-band","L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB)","passive microwaves","soil moisture","Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission","validation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2170177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6186863/06068242.pdf","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2170177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of SMOS Brightness Temperatures During the HOBE Airborne Campaign, Western Denmark","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Validation of SMOS Brightness Temperatures During the HOBE Airborne Campaign, Western Denmark","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068242/","volume":"50","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068242/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12691979","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of SMOS Brightness Temperatures During the HOBE Airborne Campaign, Western Denmark","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bircher-2170177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132024S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6186863","articleId":"6068242","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6068244,"authors":[{"name":"Mei-Yung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronic Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/6068244/6068244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mei-Yung Chen received the B.S. degree from Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan, in 1992, the M.S. degree from Chungyuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Mechatronic Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei.

Specifically, in this system, a new structure with an adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC) algorithm is described, which aims to achieve the following three goals: 1) a large moving range (millimeter level); 2) precise positioning (micrometer level); and 3) fast response. The system consists of a moving carrier platform, six permanent magnets (PMs) attached to the carrier, and six electromagnets mounted on a fixed base. After exploring the characteristics of the magnetic forces between PMs and electromagnets, the general 6-DOF dynamic model of this system is derived and analyzed. Then, because of the naturally unstable behavior inherent in maglev systems, the proposed ASMC guarantees satisfactory performance of the maglev system. Experiments have successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the overall system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2174531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6220909/06068244.pdf","startPage":"4128","endPage":"4139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2174531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6220909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experiment of a Macro\u2013Micro Planar Maglev Positioning System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068244/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experiment of a Macro\u2013Micro Planar Maglev Positioning System","volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12804825","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068244/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experiment of a Macro\u2013Micro Planar Maglev Positioning System","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2174531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085235S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6220909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6220909","articleId":"6068244","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6068247,"authors":[{"name":"Udaya K.

With the emergence of applications such as electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid systems, IPT systems with bidirectional power flow have become a recent focus. In contrast to simple unidirectional IPT systems, bidirectional systems are complex in nature and essentially require more sophisticated and robust control strategies. This paper proposes a new controller, which is based on power-frequency droop characteristics of IPT systems, to regulate its power flow in both directions without a dedicated communication link. The proposed controller is applicable to unidirectional as well as bidirectional IPT systems with either single or multiple loads and ensures that power intake by the load side is always kept within the capability of the supply side. Analysis, together with both experimental and simulated results, of a 1-kW single-load bidirectional IPT system is presented with discussions to show that the proposed droop controller can successfully be used to regulate the two-way power flow.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06068247.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2174537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2174537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power\u2013Frequency Controller for Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency control","Load flow","Voltage control","Bidirectional control","Frequency conversion","Reactive power","Coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency control","inductive power transmission","load flow control","power control","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-frequency controller","bidirectional inductive power transfer systems","IPT technology","electric vehicles","vehicle-to-grid systems","bidirectional power flow","unidirectional IPT systems","robust control strategy","power-frequency droop characteristics","power flow regulation","dedicated communication link","single-load bidirectional IPT system","droop controller","two-way power flow","power 1 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contactless power","electric vehicle (EV) resonant circuit","inductive power transfer (IPT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Power\u2013Frequency Controller for Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Systems","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6068247/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968356","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power\u2013Frequency Controller for Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-madawala-2174537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053612S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6068247","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6068250,"authors":[{"name":"Duleepa J.

However, in contrast to unidirectional IPT systems, bidirectional IPT systems require more sophisticated control strategies to control the power flow. An indispensible component of such control strategies is the robust and accurate synchronization between the primary- and pickup-side converters, without which the transfer of real power in any direction cannot be guaranteed. This paper proposes a novel technique that synchronizes converters on both the primary and pickup sides of bidirectional IPT systems. The technique uses an auxiliary winding, located on the pickup side, to produce a synchronizing signal which, in turn, can be utilized to regulate the real power flow. This paper also presents a mathematical model for the proposed technique and investigates its sensitivity for component tolerances. The viability of the technique, which is applicable to both single- and multiple-pickup IPT systems, is demonstrated through both simulations and experimental results of a 1-kW prototype bidirectional IPT system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2174536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06068250.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"309","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2174536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Synchronization Technique for Bidirectional IPT Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Synchronization Technique for Bidirectional IPT Systems","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6068250/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968357","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Synchronization Technique for Bidirectional IPT Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-thrimawithana-2174536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067971S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6068250","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6068251,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilei Yao","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6361304/6068251/6068251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhilei Yao was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1981.

However, the waveform qualities of the grid current in grid-connected mode and the output voltage in stand-alone mode are poor under the nonlinear critical load with the conventional control. The impact of the nonlinear load on the grid current is analyzed. The proposed control is illustrated in detail. By adding the load current into the filter inductor current loop, the influence of the nonlinear load on the grid current can be eliminated, and the waveform quality of the output voltage in stand-alone mode can be improved. The control method is simple and easy to be achieved. The grid-connected inverter is stable at both modes. The filter inductor is chosen. Simulation and experimental results from a 1-kW dual-buck full-bridge grid-interactive inverter with a diode rectifier load verify the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068251/","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6068251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13136550","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Control of Single-Phase Grid-Connected Inverters With Nonlinear Loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Single-Phase Grid-Connected Inverters With Nonlinear Loads","sourcePdf":"tie-yao-2174535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088294S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6361304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6361304","articleId":"6068251","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6068257,"authors":[{"name":"Suat U.

The power amplifiers under test are a standard class-AB amplifier and a Doherty amplifier. The PAPR reduction methods are based on a state-of-the art convex optimization formulation and on the standard clipping and filtering technique. The DPD method consists of modeling the behavior of the power amplifier using a parallel Hammerstein model, and then extracting the inverse parameters based on the indirect learning architecture. To achieve better DPD performance, extracting the DPD parameters based on multiple-step iterations is investigated. The cases where PAPR reduction and DPD are applied separately and combined are studied and investigated. Power amplifier figures of merit are evaluated. Good performance is shown when combining both pre-processing techniques up to a certain operating point where DPD performance deteriorates due to generation of strong peaks in the signal. In addition, a difference in the power amplifier behavior is reported and analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2170583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6097087/06068260.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2170583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6097087","startPage":"3504","endPage":"3511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction and Digital Pre-Distortion for OFDM Based Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction and Digital Pre-Distortion for OFDM Based Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408794","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6068260/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction and Digital Pre-Distortion for OFDM Based Systems","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nader-2170583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063075S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6097087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6097087","articleId":"6068260","onlineDate":"02 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6068263,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Vena","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Conception et dInt\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS), Grenoble Institute of Technology, Valence, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6097087/6068263/6068263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arnaud Vena received the Eng.

The proposed tag is based on 5 `C' like metallic strip resonators having resonance frequency within the band of 2.5 GHz to 7.5 GHz. The tag is potentially low-cost since only one conductive layer is needed for the fabrication.

Target code is meant to be generated from design models through appropriate model transformations, once the code has been generated, quality attributes of the embedded system are evaluated by execution monitoring/analysis tools. Eventually, in order to complete a model-driven round-trip approach, provision of back-annotation of the target code analysis results to modeling level is crucial for evaluating and consequently optimizing the design models for ensuring preservation of analyzed extra-functional aspects. In this work the problem of providing such approach in terms of process and related challenges is described together with a proposed solution. Particular emphasis is put on the description of how both traceability information and code analysis results are formalized in order to enable the desired back-annotating capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/SEAA.2011.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAA.2011.39","startPage":"200","endPage":"208","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 37th EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068192/6068309/06068345.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 37th EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Round-Trip Support for Model-Driven Engineering of Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Round-Trip Support for Model-Driven Engineering of Embedded Systems","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-2 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068345/","accessionNumber":"12345675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068345/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Round-Trip Support for Model-Driven Engineering of Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"4488a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069288S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068192","isNumber":"6068309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068192","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6068309","articleId":"6068345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6068518,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Yahia","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche Mod\u00e9lisation, Analyse et Commande des Syst\u00e8mes MACS, Universit\u00e9 de Gab\u00e8s, Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Gab\u00e8s, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Yahia","id":"37282319500"},{"name":"Mohamed N.

The finite element method characterizes waves in the arbitrarily shaped discontinuities and the total response of the circuit is obtained by applying the modified multimodal variational formulation. The size of the scattering matrix of the total circuit depends only on the number of accessible modes in the beginning and the end of the overall structure. This feature makes the computation time of our hybrid method independent from distances between discontinuities of the circuit. The proposed hybrid method is successfully applied to the full-wave analysis of filters with great practical interest (i.e., multimode filters), thus improving computation time and memory storage against several full-wave finite element method based computer aided design tools.","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2011.6068518","publicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056716/6068506/06068518.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2011.6068518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rectangular waveguide filter design using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068518/","displayDocTitle":"Rectangular waveguide filter design using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345715","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068518/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rectangular waveguide filter design using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"mms20110submission004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06335S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056716","isNumber":"6068506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056716","xplore-issue":"6068506","articleId":"6068518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6068539,"authors":[{"name":"Malek Ben Hammouda","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Microsyst\u00e8mes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res (UQTR), Trois Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Malek","lastName":"Ben Hammouda","id":"38282684800"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Domingue","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Microsyst\u00e8mes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res (UQTR), Trois Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Domingue","id":"37397842900"},{"name":"Messaoud Ahmed-Ouameur","affiliation":["Lyrtech Inc., Quebec, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Messaoud","lastName":"Ahmed-Ouameur","id":"38276586200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1814-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1813-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9822"}],"articleNumber":"6068539","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068539","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Micromechanical devices","Impedance matching","Capacitance","PHEMTs","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","high electron mobility transistors","impedance matching","microfabrication","micromechanical devices","microwave amplifiers","mobile radio","UHF amplifiers","UHF transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS based tunable microwave amplifier design","reconfigurable PCS 1900 mobile application","RF amplifier","compact tunable MEMS impedance matching network","PHEMT transistor","MEMS circuits","UW-MEMS process","frequency 2 GHz","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF-MEMS tuner","DMTL","CPW","Impedance matching","reconfigurable matching network"]}],"abstract":"A RF amplifier based on compact tunable MEMS impedance matching network was designed for sub-2GHz frequency applications.

Its architecture is based on super-heterodyne receiver supporting Sub-Band Sensing technique. In this study, the IEEE 802.22 radio system characteristics are dispatched throughout the different RF receiver blocks. Besides, theoretical computation and various techniques of the system level design are developed. Simulation results for RF characteristics such as noise figure (NF), linearity (third order intercept point, (IIP3)), gain, and output power are introduced. The obtained specifications for each RF block proved that its linearity and NF requirements are related to its own gain performance. The receiver performs a total gain of 54dB and an IIP3 of -17.8dBm for low gain mode. It achieves 105dB as gain, IIP3 of -23.7dBm and a noise figure of 6.6dB for high gain mode.","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2011.6068555","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056716/6068506/06068555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2011.6068555","publicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of adaptive modulation on system level design for IEEE802.22 Cognitive Radio receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of adaptive modulation on system level design for IEEE802.22 Cognitive Radio receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068555/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345752","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of adaptive modulation on system level design for IEEE802.22 Cognitive Radio receiver","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"mms20110submission041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086126S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056716","isNumber":"6068506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056716","xplore-issue":"6068506","articleId":"6068555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6068561,"authors":[{"name":"Jungsik Park","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Division, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea","Department of Computer and Radio Communications Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jungsik Park","id":"37087708741"},{"name":"Jiyong Park","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Division, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jiyong Park","id":"37087708390"},{"name":"Junho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Radio Communications Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Junho Choi","id":"37087710425"},{"name":"Young-Sik Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Radio Communications Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Sik Kim","id":"37087147164"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1814-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1813-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9822"}],"articleNumber":"6068561","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":633},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Slot antennas","Correlation","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","capacitors","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","planar inverted-F antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna","T-shaped ground slot","chip capacitor","closely packed planar inverted F antennas","closely packed PIFA","WLAN band","mobile phone applications","antenna gain","frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.48 GHz","efficiency 40 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna","MIMO","WLAN","mobile phone","correlation","mutual coupilng","isolation","capacitor","slot"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a T-shaped ground slot with a chip capacitor to improve isolation between two closely packed planar inverted F antennas (PIFAs) is presented at the WLAN band of 2.4 GHz - 2.48 GHz for mobile phone applications.

A new algebraic estimation method is proposed, in order to exploit the powerful algebraic ASTC technique in wide-band systems, when the CFOs occur with small variation and to overcome the sensitivity of the ASTC codes in frequency synchronization problemof OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2011.6068562","publicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056716/6068506/06068562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2011.6068562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068506","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Carrier Frequency Offset estimator for ASTC-MIMO-OFDM systems over correlated frequency selective channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Carrier Frequency Offset estimator for ASTC-MIMO-OFDM systems over correlated frequency selective channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345759","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6068562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Carrier Frequency Offset estimator for ASTC-MIMO-OFDM systems over correlated frequency selective channel","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"mms20110submission048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065885S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056716","isNumber":"6068506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056716","xplore-issue":"6068506","articleId":"6068562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6068564,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hayouni","affiliation":["6tel Research Unit, Higher School of Communications Sup COM, University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hayouni","id":"38016172400"},{"name":"Nabil Dakhli","affiliation":["6tel Research Unit, Higher School of Communications Sup COM, University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Dakhli","id":"37596933300"},{"name":"Fethi Choubani","affiliation":["6tel Research Unit, Higher School of Communications Sup COM, University of Carthage, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fethi","lastName":"Choubani","id":"37299362800"},{"name":"Tan-Hoa Vuong","affiliation":["ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France"],"lastName":"Tan-Hoa Vuong","id":"38000062800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1814-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1813-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9822"}],"articleNumber":"6068564","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Microstrip","Time domain analysis","Microstrip antennas","Antenna measurements","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip antennas","microwave antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D FDTD analysis","compact UWB planar antenna","compact UWB rectangular patch antenna","convex circled form","partial grounded FR4 epoxy substrate","printed antenna","Ansoft HFSS simulation","radiofrequency application","frequency 3.55 GHz to 4.6 GHz","frequency 7.4 GHz to 11.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorbing boundary conditions","FDTD method","Gaussian impulse excitation","UWB antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a compact UWB rectangular patch antenna with two convex circled forms is presented.

The loss of sub channel orthogonality leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI). Using many algorithms for channel estimation, we will show that, for a 16- QAM modulation, the LMMSE algorithm performs well to achieve this estimation but when the SNR (Signal Noise Rate) is high, the three algorithms (LS, LMMSE and Lr-LMMSE) performs similarly. The challenge in this paper is that we will demonstrate that the LMMSE algorithm performs well with the block pilot insertion and is not suitable just with comb pilot insertion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056716/6068506/06068567.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2011.6068567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2011.6068567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LMMSE channel estimation for block - pilot insertion in OFDM systems under time varying conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Interference","Estimation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMMSE channel estimation","block-pilot insertion","OFDM systems","time varying conditions","intercarrier interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM Systems","Channel Estimation","block - pilot insertion","time varying channel","LMMSE","Lr-LMMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"LMMSE channel estimation for block - pilot insertion in OFDM systems under time varying conditions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068567/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345764","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LMMSE channel estimation for block - pilot insertion in OFDM systems under time varying conditions","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"mms20110submission053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050275S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056716","isNumber":"6068506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056716","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6068506","articleId":"6068567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6068575,"authors":[{"name":"Maha Dakhli","affiliation":["6Tel@Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Dakhli","id":"37846071200"},{"name":"Rafik Zayani","affiliation":["6Tel@Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rafik","lastName":"Zayani","id":"37297085500"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["6Tel@Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37297081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1814-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1813-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9822"}],"articleNumber":"6068575","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Artificial neural networks","MIMO","Bit error rate","Neurons","Nonlinear distortion","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multilayer perceptrons","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radio receivers","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network compensator","MMSE receiver","HPA","MIMO OFDM systems","minimum mean square error","nonlinear distortions","NL distortions","high power amplifier","feedforward multilayer perceptron","MLP","Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm","VBLAST MIMO OFDM","Rayleigh fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VBLAST","MIMO","OFDM","HPA","NEURAL NETWORK","MLP","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a method based on Neural Network (NN) technique and accompanied with MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error), which corrects at the receiver level, the Non-Linear (NL) distortions due to the HPA (High Power Amplifier).

Many research works concern the design and development of new technological applications to improve marine communications. Particularly, a wireless communication system based on WiMAX standard at the 5.8 GHz band (license-exempt band) could be a good candidate. As an initial task, a propagation channel measurement campaign in maritime environments was carried out to investigate the impact of the wireless channel in different situations. This work provides large scale path loss measurements over sea around urban environments. In particular, a radio link between a buoy and a ship at 5.8 GHz is studied. NLOS (Non-Line-Of-Sight) paths are investigated in depth and they are compared to LOS (Line-Of-Sight) paths. The designed measurement system is described and the experimental measurements are shown. An empirical model is obtained using these experimental data and the key wireless channel parameters are analyzed. In addition, the empirical model is compared to the free space and two-ray theoretical models. This investigation is useful, among others, for planning Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks offshore around these challenge environments.","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2011.6068590","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6056716/6068506/06068590.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2011.6068590","publicationTitle":"2011 11th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buoy-to-ship experimental measurements over sea at 5.8 GHz near urban environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Buoy-to-ship experimental measurements over sea at 5.8 GHz near urban environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068590/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12345785","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buoy-to-ship experimental measurements over sea at 5.8 GHz near urban environments","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"mms20110submission076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049228S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6056716","isNumber":"6068506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056716","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6068506","articleId":"6068590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6068596,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An easy integration into existing systems makes the multi frequency transponder competitive on the market because commercial HF and UHF readers can be used. Only two input pins are necessary to connect the chip to a broadband antenna by using the concept of combining a balanced HF and an unbalanced UHF frontend.

However, the majority of RFID applications require the utilization of multiple RFID readers and therefore effective and efficient planning of their networks is a major concern. Network planning is a complex process that involves different steps, one of which is its topology design. In this paper, we focus on the topology design process of a RFID network following an optimization-based approach. More precisely, we propose a multi-objective cost function that is used to evaluate candidate solutions for the position and power levels of the set of RFID readers to be deployed. In order to obtain optimal solutions we applied Genetic Algorithms, a well known heuristic technique. Finally, a developed software tool to assist in the topology design is also presented and processing delay measurements are performed.","doi":"10.1109/RFID-TA.2011.6068653","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6058515/6068591/06068653.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID-TA.2011.6068653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFID network topology design based on Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Genetic algorithms","Network topology","Topology","Equations","Mathematical model","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID network topology design","genetic algorithms","radio frequency identification","RFID readers","network planning","topology design process","optimization-based approach","multiobjective cost function","heuristic technique","processing delay measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Radio Frequency Identification","Network Planning","Network Topology Design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"RFID network topology design based on Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12355995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFID network topology design based on Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"p300botero.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077173S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6058515","isNumber":"6068591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6058515","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6068591","articleId":"6068653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6068660,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Malek","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Malek","id":"37265613000"},{"name":"Ali Miri","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Miri","id":"37273732400"},{"name":"Luis Orozco-Barbosa","affiliation":["University of Castilla La Mancha, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Orozco-Barbosa","id":"38182197800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0027-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0028-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0026-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6068660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Protocols","Public key","RFID tags"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backward link authentication","RFID tags","radio frequency identification","RFID systems","McEliece cryptosystem","asymmetric cryptosystem","communication confidentiality","password-based protocol"]}],"abstract":"The content of an Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag should be protected from unauthorized access and only trusted readers should be able to modify the data on the tag. Providing security for RFID systems is a challenging task mainly due to the hardware limitations and economical constraints of RFID systems. In this work, we focus on the problem of authenticating readers to RFID tags or Backward Link Authentication. Most authentication schemes for RFID systems function on a password-based protocol or a symmetric-key algorithm, which often lacks strong security or has the key-management problem. In this work, we propose an adaptation of an asymmetric cryptosystem, i.e. McEliece cryptosystem, to design an authentication scheme suitable for RFID systems. We show that the proposed authentication scheme has a small overhead and can be efficiently implemented in low-cost RFID tags. The same authentication system with slight modifications can be reused to provide communication confidentiality.

This technology can be found in the utmost fields of our daily life, e.g. supply-chain management, libraries, access management etc. Since the first RFID Tags possessed very small computational capacity only mathematical and logical operations and one-way hash functions could be used. However, in the last years RFID technology achieved that CPU speed on which PKI systems can be run. In this paper we present our elliptic curve cryptography based authentication protocol which proofs against the well-known attacks. Furthermore, we introduce a performance analysis and a comparison with other EC based protocols.

The feasibility analysis indicates that a passive fully-integrated \u03bcRFID tag, with on-chip antenna, can be realized in 65-nm SOI CMOS technology at 60 GHz with an operating range of about 20 cm. The 65-nm SOI CMOS technology represents a good candidate due to its better performance in terms of low-losses, low-power consumption and lower leakage current if compared with standard bulk process. The proposed circuit does not require complex package or bonding, thanks to the on-chip antenna, and it does not need battery. The low-cost technology and low-weight and low-area occupation are important features of this \u03bcRFID, especially if produced in large scale for the mass-market. Since the design of integrated antennas in silicon technology is one of the main challenge, especially for this proposal, two 60-GHz antennas have been designed by means of 3D-EM simulator: a CPW double-slot antenna and a CPS dipole one. The simulation results show a gain of 4.44 dBi and 3.23 dBi for the proposed double slot and dipole on-chip antennas, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","CMOS integrated circuits","Antenna radiation patterns","Coplanar waveguides","Gain","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","coplanar waveguides","millimetre wave antennas","radiofrequency identification","silicon-on-insulator","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feasibility study","on-chip antenna","fully integrated \u03bcRFID tag","CMOS SOI","low-power consumption","lower leakage current","standard bulk process","3D-EM simulator","CPW double-slot antenna","CPS dipole one","silicon technology","frequency 60 GHz","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60-GHz","65nm CMOS SOI (Silicon on Insulator)","CoPlanar Waveguide (CPW)","CoPlanar Strip (CPS)","Onchip integrated antenna","Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RFID-TA.2011.6068678","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6058515/6068591/06068678.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID-TA.2011.6068678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility study and on-chip antenna for fully integrated \u03bcRFID tag at 60 GHz in 65 nm CMOS SOI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6068678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility study and on-chip antenna for fully integrated \u03bcRFID tag at 60 GHz in 65 nm CMOS SOI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6068678/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6068678/","accessionNumber":"12356020","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility study and on-chip antenna for fully integrated \u03bcRFID tag at 60 GHz in 65 nm CMOS SOI","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"p457fonte.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075963S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6058515","isNumber":"6068591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6058515","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6068591","articleId":"6068678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6068711,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A variety of data mining tools and techniques are available in the industry, but they have been used in a very limited way for meteorological data. In this paper, a neural network-based algorithm for predicting the atmosphere for a future time and a given location is presented. We have used Back Propagation Neural (BPN) Network for initial modelling. The results obtained by BPN model are fed to a Hopfield Network. The performance of our proposed ANN-based method (BPN and Hopfield Network based combined approach) tested on 3 years weather data set comprising 15000 records containing attributes like temperature, humidity and wind speed. The prediction error is found to be very less and the learning converges very sharply. The main focus of this paper is based on predictive data mining by which we can extract interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from huge amount of meteorological data.","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069300","startPage":"192","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069300.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weather Data Mining using Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069300/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Weather Data Mining using Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069300/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12356066","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weather Data Mining using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042886S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6069305,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, a modified Nauta's OTA with double CMOS pair is proposed and is used for implementing a programmable Gm-C filter. The double CMOS pair enables the transconductance to be varied by varying the bias voltages at high impedance nodes. This in turn results in programmability of the filter (F-tuning). For the purpose of comparison, the proposed OTA and Nauta's OTA reported in the literature are implemented in UMC-0.18\u03bcm CMOS process and studied through simulation. The proposed OTA results in 11 dB increase in the PSRR and 21 dB increase in the CMRR compared to the Nauta's OTA. The tunable second order Gm-C band pass filter using the proposed OTA is implemented and studied. Simulation of filter is done with BSIM3V3 parameters under (\u00b10.9V) supply voltage and (\u00b11.4V) supply voltage for biasing of double CMOS pair. It is verified from the post-layout simulation that the filter can be tuned over the range (10MHz-300MHz).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069305.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of Gm-C filter using modified Nauta OTA with double CMOS pair","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology","Transconductance","Computer architecture","Simulation","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","modified Nauta OTA","double CMOS pair","programmable Gm-C filter","transconductance","UMC-0.18\u03bcm CMOS process","tunable second order Gm-C band pass filter","BSIM3V3 parameters","supply voltage","post-layout simulation","size 0.18 mum","noise figure 11 dB to 21 dB","frequency 10 MHz to 300 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OTA","Gm-c filter","double CMOS pair","bandpass"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of Gm-C filter using modified Nauta OTA with double CMOS pair","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356071","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of Gm-C filter using modified Nauta OTA with double CMOS pair","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05093S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6069312,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

In this paper, the design and functionality of a novel ultra low power stable SRAM cell is discussed which addresses power minimization as well as stability against large variation in temperature which is ideally suited for space applications. This paper explores a novel circuit level approach to reduce power in the SRAM cell during active mode of operation as well as standby mode by incorporating NMOS-PMOS pair in each pull down path. During active mode power reduction takes place by increasing the impedance of the ground path and thus reducing the current. In the idle mode, the state of the SRAM cell is retained to a good logic-1(0) value and sub threshold leakage is reduced by utilizing stack effect. It is found that this cell operating at a supply voltage value of 0.5V, using 50nm BSIM models resulted in about 19X power savings in active mode and 21X times in stand-by state-retention mode. Better stability is also reported with large variations in temperature when compared to the standard 6-T SRAM cell and other representative low leakage power SRAM cells due to self controlling feedback. The NMOS- PMOS pair provides the compensation against the linear dependence of current on temperature. This novel cell achieves excellent active mode power minimization (which is usually not addressed in SRAM designs which achieve standby mode power minimization) along with good leakage power reduction.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069360.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel stable sram for ultra low power deep submicron cache memories","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel stable sram for ultra low power deep submicron cache memories","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356125","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6069360/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel stable sram for ultra low power deep submicron cache memories","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04538S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6069375,"authors":[{"name":"Apurba Gorai","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Apurba","lastName":"Gorai","id":"38026038900"},{"name":"Ashish Ghosh","affiliation":["Center for Soft Computing Research, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37291941500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9477-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9478-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9475-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9476-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6069375","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1316},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069375","abstract":"Image enhancement is aimed to improve image quality by maximizing the information content in the input image. In this article a PSO based hue preserving color image enhancement technique is proposed. The process is as follows. Image enhancement is considered as an optimization problem and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve it. The quality of the intensity image is improved by a parameterized transformation function, in which parameters are optimized by PSO based on an objective function. The intensity transformation function uses local and global information of the input image and the objective function considers the entropy and edge information to measure the image quality. The enhanced color image is then obtained by scaling, which sometimes leads to gamut problem for few pixels. Rescaling is done to the saturation component to remove the gamut problem. The algorithm is tested on several color images and results are compared with two other popular color image enhancement techniques like hue-preserving color image enhancement without gamut problem (HPCIE) and a genetic algorithm based approach to color image enhancement (GACIE). Visual analysis, detail and background variance of the resultant images are reported. It has been found that the proposed method produces better results compared to other two methods.","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069375","startPage":"563","endPage":"568","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069375.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hue-preserving color image enhancement using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Image enhancement","Genetic algorithms","Entropy","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","genetic algorithms","image colour analysis","image enhancement","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","image quality","PSO based hue preserving color image enhancement technique","parameterized transformation function","intensity transformation function","edge information","entropy","gamut problem","genetic algorithm based approach","visual analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hue-preserving color image enhancement using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356140","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hue-preserving color image enhancement using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063545S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6069382,"authors":[{"name":"R Archana","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Science &Technology, Kerala, Angamaly, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Archana","id":"37542035400"},{"name":"A.

The generic technique for image binarization requires choosing a threshold value and comparing the pixel values with the threshold and classifying as black and white. The proposed algorithm calculates a global optimum threshold by learning from the image background and foreground features. A simple two-weight neural network is implemented to cluster the foreground and background pixels. Here an adaptive thresholding technique based on competitive learning is selected for Weight Updating. The developed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA platform hardware system, which consists of two functional blocks. The first block is used to obtain the threshold value for the image frame; another block to apply the threshold value to the frame. This parallelism and the simple hardware component of both blocks make this approach suitable for real-time applications, while the performance remains comparable with the Otsu technique frequently used in off-line threshold determination. Results from the proposed algorithm are presented for numerous examples, both from simulations and experimentally using the FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069387","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","startPage":"633","endPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and development of FPGA based adaptive thresholder for image processing applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of FPGA based adaptive thresholder for image processing applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069387/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356152","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6069387/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of FPGA based adaptive thresholder for image processing applications","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086586S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6069410,"authors":[{"name":"Latha R.

The prototype development includes building the hardware and software subsystems for the robot. The robot controller has developed using the Altera DE2 Development Board with the software implementation done in Quartus II 8.1 and NIOS II IDE using C language programming. Hardware development of the robot involves building the main chassis, the stepper motor and drivers, sensor circuitries and electro pneumatic controls of the air brush for painting. The software implementation includes converting the MATLAB code to C and VHDL codes to generate the coordinates when the area of the workspace is provided. These coordinates are used to specify the changes in length for the supporting string. The robot movements from point to point are done based on changing the respective suspension lengths to reach a particular coordinate. A path planning algorithm was developed and validated in MATLAB with two path options, z-path and u-path. The paint area was also plotted on the workspace in the GUI. In the functional prototype, the robot is able to paint a workspace specified by user, avoiding all windows area. However, the quality of painting needs to be greatly improved before deployments are possible.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069415.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAINTbot - FPGA based wall painting service robot prototype","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"PAINTbot - FPGA based wall painting service robot prototype","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356178","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6069415/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAINTbot - FPGA based wall painting service robot prototype","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086814S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6069427,"authors":[{"name":"Sandip Chanda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Techno India, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Chanda","id":"37860772000"},{"name":"Abhinandan De","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, Howrah, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Abhinandan","lastName":"De","id":"37446426300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9477-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9478-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9475-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9476-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6069427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Power system stability","Load flow","Optimization","Indexes","Particle swarm optimization","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","particle swarm optimisation","power transmission economics","power transmission lines","power transmission reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","deregulated power system","swarm intelligence based optimization","power system networks","transmission line overload","power transaction requests","line congestion","system stability","security","reliability","line outages","system operators","congestion sensitivity index","power network","congestion management charge","FACTS devices","IEEE 30 bus benchmark system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Congestion","Contingency","Congestion","Congestion Sensitivity index"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069427","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059528/6069258/06069427.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems","startPage":"837","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of particle swarm optimisation for relieving congestion in deregulated power system","abstract":"This paper presents a Swarm intelligence based Optimization technique to manage congestion in power system networks with transmission line overload. To maintain all the power transaction requests, line congestion in deregulated systems is almost inevitable which may degrade the system stability, security and reliability by additional line outages. In practice System Operators (SO) charge additional price known as congestion management charge against line limit violation. Thus, restricting power flows within the safe limits is important from stability as well as economy point of view. The algorithm proposed in the present paper uses a standard congestion sensitivity Index to identify the congested lines in a large power network and optimizes `congestion management charge' without any load curtailment and installation of FACTS devices. The operating conditions with the proposed methodology have been demonstrated to be subjected to an improvement with reference to conventional method. The applicability of the proposed methodology has been presented on IEEE 30 bus benchmark system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069427/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12356189","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069427/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of particle swarm optimisation for relieving congestion in deregulated power system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of particle swarm optimisation for relieving congestion in deregulated power system","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05323S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059528","isNumber":"6069258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059528","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6069258","articleId":"6069427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6069465,"authors":[{"name":"K.

E.g., VHDL 2008 extended the concept of generics from integral numbers to types, packages and subroutines. This paper presents a hardware description language based on the VHDL semantics - THDL++. It supports the extended generic concept and improves it further by supporting compile-time lists with \u201cfor each\u201d semantics, inheritance, expression type derivation and late binding. We also present THDL++ compiler with 2 back-ends: a synthesizable VHDL-87 back-end makes it easy to integrate THDL++ into any existing design flow, and a C++ back-end that generates a cycle-accurate model for fast simulation. We illustrate how using THDL++ significantly reduces design effort compared to raw VHDL by making the code more readable and reusable. As a case study, we present a hardware LZSS (ZIP) compressor, targeting Xilinx FPGAs that's development was accelerated by using THDL++. We demonstrate how using THDL++ reduced the amount of code lines by a factor of 1.85 compared to VHDL and how using the C++ back-end increased simulation performance by a factor of 8 compared to ModelSim [1].

During the last decades, several partition methodologies have been proposed, most of them based on software and hardware performance estimations. A common limitation of these methodologies is that the source code of the hardware part has to be modified and/or adapted in order to obtain accurate hardware estimations. This paper presents a new hardware performance estimation tool that works with high-level system specifications. An important advantage of the proposal is that the same source code can be used for hardware and software estimations. In order to obtain the execution time of the hardware partition during system simulation, every element of the algorithm is decomposed into primitive operations that are dynamically queued in a sliding-window of limited size. Several hardware-related restrictions are applied to this queue and two dynamic scheduling methodologies are used. The first scheduling methodology enables the estimation of a low bound of the hardware execution time. This estimation should be faster than any implementation of the hardware part. The second methodology provides an upper limit of the execution time that represents a hardware implementation with a low synthesis effort. These limits help designers to decide if it worthwhile to adapt part of the code to be implemented in hardware.","publicationTitle":"FDL 2011 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"FDL 2011 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062354/6069466/06069487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware performance estimation by dynamic scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069487/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware performance estimation by dynamic scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12344884","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069487/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware performance estimation by dynamic scheduling","confLoc":"Oldenburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"FDL2011Session6LBSDPaper4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052354S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062354","isNumber":"6069466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062354","xplore-issue":"6069466","articleId":"6069487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ECSI","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6069498,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Grossmann","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6069495/6069498/6069498-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcus Grossmann received the Diplom-Ingenieur (M.S.) degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany, in 2004.","From 2005 to 2010, he was with the Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology.

For an efficient implementation of the equalizer, the linear groupwise SC-MMSE filter is directly derived in the frequency domain by introducing an additional design criterion in the optimization. Special focus is given on different heuristic methods for group selection based on mean-squared error (MSE) and spatial channel correlation criteria. The first method dynamically forms groups incorporating a priori information at each turbo iteration, while the second and third methods provide a static grouping that is valid for all turbo iterations. Results of correlation chart analysis and bit error rate simulations demonstrate that the groupwise turbo frequency domain equalizer (FDE) achieves a large performance gain over the conventional SC-MMSE FDE in intersymbol interference multiple access channels with high spatial correlation among the multiple users' transmitted signals. Moreover, it is shown that the simple static correlation-based grouping scheme when applied to the proposed receiver achieves similar performance than the dynamic MSE-based scheme at a significantly reduced complexity. In addition, to assess the practicality of the novel algorithm in real scenarios, we show numerical results obtained by a series of simulations using channel-sounding field measurement data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/06069498.pdf","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2173555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2173555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Groupwise Frequency Domain Multiuser MMSE Turbo Equalization for Single Carrier Block Transmission Over Spatially Correlated Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Equalizers","Mean square error methods","Interference cancellation","Maximum a posteriori estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","least mean squares methods","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groupwise frequency domain multiuser MMSE turbo equalization","single carrier block transmission","spatial correlated channels","linear groupwise SC-MMSE filter","groupwise soft interference cancelling minimum mean-squared error filtering","optimization","turbo iteration","FDE","intersymbol interference multiple access channels","channel-sounding field measurement data","bit error rate simulations","turbo iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation chart analysis","groupwise minimum mean-squared error turbo equalization","single carrier transmission","spatially correlated channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Groupwise Frequency Domain Multiuser MMSE Turbo Equalization for Single Carrier Block Transmission Over Spatially Correlated Channels","volume":"5","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6069498/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360028","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Groupwise Frequency Domain Multiuser MMSE Turbo Equalization for Single Carrier Block Transmission Over Spatially Correlated Channels","sourcePdf":"jstsp-grossmann-2173555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111507S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6069498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069519,"authors":[{"name":"Robert S.

After 13 years in the research area with Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, he joined UCSB in 1984, where he is currently with the Department of Materials and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 1990, he co-founded optical concepts, later acquired as Gore Photonics, to develop novel vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) technology, and in 1998, he co-founded Agility Communications, Inc., Goleta, CA, later acquired by JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDSU), Milpitas, CA, to develop widely tunable integrated transmitters. At Bell Laboratories, he was initially on waveguided surface-acoustic-wave signal processing devices and coupled-resonator filters. He later developed tunable coupled-cavity lasers using novel reactive-ion etching technology that he created for the new InP-based materials. At UCSB, he continued work on multiple-section tunable lasers, in 1988, inventing the widely tunable multi-element mirror concept, which is currently used in some JDSU products. Near this same time period, he also made seminal contributions to efficient VCSEL designs that continue to be implemented in practical devices to present. More recently, his group has developed high-performance InP-based photonic integrated circuits as well as high-speed VCSELs, and they continue to advance the underlying materials growth and fabrication technologies.

However, modern RF-photonic link applications demand PICs with high spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). The SFDR of active PICs integrating semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is limited by amplified spontaneous emission noise and distortion caused by four-wave mixing. Here, we derive an analytical model for the SFDR of SOAs, and extend it to PICs with arbitrary transfer functions integrating many SOAs. The model is general and applicable to any photonic signal-processing circuit operating in the linear amplification regime below saturation. We show analytically the importance of SFDR-driven photonic design over noise-figure-driven design. Using this model, we explore the SFDR of coupled-ring bandpass filters integrated on a high saturation power integration platform and show SFDR as high as 117.0 dB\u00b7Hz\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2/3</sup>\n for filters with bandwidths in the 1-2 GHz range.

Because the common filtering methods for HSIs are based on the data vectorization or matricization while ignoring the related information between image planes, there are new approaches considering multidimensional data as whole entities, for example, multidimensional Wiener filtering (MWF) based on Tucker3 tensor decomposition. However, if HSIs are not disturbed by white noise, MWF cannot effectively remove the nonwhite noise and obtain the expected signal. To reduce nonwhite noise from HSIs, a new method is proposed in this letter. The first step of this method is to whiten the noise in HSIs through a prewhitening procedure. Then, MWF can help to denoise the prewhitened data. At last, an inverse prewhitening process can rebuild the estimated signal. Comparative studies with existing denoising methods show that the proposed approach has promising prospects in this field.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2169041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06069529.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2169041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonwhite Noise Reduction in Hyperspectral Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069529/","displayDocTitle":"Nonwhite Noise Reduction in Hyperspectral Images","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069529/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonwhite Noise Reduction in Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-bourennane-2169041-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067462S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6069529","onlineDate":"03 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069540,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Acary","affiliation":["BIPOP project-team, INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Saint-Ismier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6187742/6069540/6069540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Acary was born in Laval, France, in 1973.

In addition, when a disturbance acts on the system, the controller attenuates the disturbance effects on the sliding surface by a factor \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i>\n (where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i>\n is the sampling period).

For the low energy consumption, the body channel communication (BCC) PHY is utilized with the theoretical results of Maxwell's equation analysis behind the BCC. Based on the channel analysis, the resonance matching (RM) and contact impedance sensing (CIS) techniques are proposed to enhance the quality of the body channel. A double-FSK modulation scheme is adopted with high scalability to fulfill the IEEE 802.15.6 Task Group specifications. In addition, a low-power double-FSK transceiver is implemented by five circuit techniques: 1) a reconfigurable LNA with CIS; 2) a current-reuse wideband demodulator; 3) a divider-based local oscillator (LO) generation with duty-cycle correction in the receiver; 4) a reconfigurable driver with RM; and 5) a divider-based digital double-FSK modulator in the transmitter. As a result, fully WBAN compatible receiver and transmitter consume 2.4 and 2 mW, respectively, at a data rate of 10 Mb/s, corresponding to energy consumption of 0.24 nJ per received bit and 0.2 nJ per transmitted bit.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6109882/06069578.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6109882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.24-nJ/b Wireless Body-Area-Network Transceiver With Scalable Double-FSK Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Transceivers","Electrodes","Energy efficiency","Frequency shift keying","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","CMOS integrated circuits","Maxwell equations","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless body area network transceiver","scalable double FSK modulation","CMOS technology","low energy consumption","body channel communication","Maxwell equation analysis","resonance matching","contact impedance sensing","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body-area network (BAN)","body-channel communication (BCC)","channel analysis","current-reuse","double-FSK","duty cycle correction","energy-efficient","FSK","FSK demodulator","FSK modulator","low energy","low power","transceiver","wireless body-area network (WBAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A 0.24-nJ/b Wireless Body-Area-Network Transceiver With Scalable Double-FSK Modulation","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6069578/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425660","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.24-nJ/b Wireless Body-Area-Network Transceiver With Scalable Double-FSK Modulation","sourcePdf":"jssc-bae-2170632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128534S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6109882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6109882","articleId":"6069578","onlineDate":"03 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069580,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Inti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6069580/6069580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajesh Inti (S'11) received the B.E. degree from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirapalli, India, in 2003, and the M.S. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 2007.

goal is to develop a visual tracking algorithm that is able to track moving objects in the presence of illumination variations in the scene and that is robust to occlusions. We treat the illumination and motion (\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$x{\\hbox {-}}y$</tex> </formula>\n translation and scale) parameters as the unknown \u201cstate\u201d sequence. The observation is the entire image, and the observation model allows for occasional occlusions (modeled as outliers). The nonlinearity and multimodality of the observation model necessitate the use of a particle filter (PF). Due to the inclusion of illumination parameters, the state dimension increases, thus making regular PFs impractically expensive. We show that the recently proposed approach using a PF with a mode tracker can be used here since, even in most occlusion cases, the posterior of illumination conditioned on motion and the previous state is unimodal and quite narrow. The key idea is to importance sample on the motion states while approximating importance sampling by posterior mode tracking for estimating illumination. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over existing PF-based approaches for various face and vehicle tracking. We are also able to detect illumination model changes, e.g., those due to transition from shadow to sunlight or vice versa by using the generalized expected log-likelihood statistics and successfully compensate for it without ever loosing track.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069594/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12615444","pubMedId":"22067364","publicationDate":"April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Particle Filter With a Mode Tracker for Visual Tracking Across Illumination Changes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Filter With a Mode Tracker for Visual Tracking Across Illumination Changes","sourcePdf":"tip-das-2174370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088931S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"32","articleId":"6069594","onlineDate":"03 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6069601,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbo Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6170969/6069601/6069601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongbo Ma (S\u201911) was born in Shaanxi, China, in 1981.

The power supply for LED also requires long life, while maintaining high efficiency, high power factor, and low cost. However, a typical power supply design employs an electrolytic capacitor as the storage capacitor, which is not only bulky, but also with a short lifespan, thus hampering performance improvement of the entire LED lighting system. In this paper, a novel power factor correction (PFC) topology is proposed by inserting the valley-fill circuit in the single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC)-derived converter, which can reduce the voltage stress of the storage capacitor and output diode under the same power factor condition. This valley-fill SEPIC-derived topology is, then, proposed for LED lighting applications. By allowing a relatively large voltage ripple in the PFC design and operating in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the proposed PFC topology is able to eliminate the electrolytic capacitor, while maintaining high power factor and high efficiency. Under the electrolytic capacitor-less condition, the proposed PFC circuit can reduce the capacitance of the storage capacitor to half for the same power factor and output voltage ripple as comparing to its original circuit. To further increase the efficiency of LED driver proposal, a twin-bus buck converter is introduced and employed as the second-stage current regulator with the PWM dimming function. The basic operating principle and analysis will be described in detail. A 50-W prototype has been built and tested in the laboratory, and the experimental results under universal input-voltage operation are presented to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6069601/","accessionNumber":"12615300","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Valley-Fill SEPIC-Derived Power Supply Without Electrolytic Capacitor for LED Lighting Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Valley-Fill SEPIC-Derived Power Supply Without Electrolytic Capacitor for LED Lighting Application","sourcePdf":"tpel-ma-2174446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128981S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6170969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6170969","articleId":"6069601","onlineDate":"03 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6069602,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiwei Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ruiwei Jiang (S'11) received the B.S. degree in industrial engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009.

With the naturally intermittent renewable energy, such as wind energy, playing more important roles, system robustness becomes a must. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach to accommodate wind output uncertainty, with the objective of providing a robust unit commitment schedule for the thermal generators in the day-ahead market that minimizes the total cost under the worst wind power output scenario. Robust optimization models the randomness using an uncertainty set which includes the worst-case scenario, and protects this scenario under the minimal increment of costs. In our approach, the power system will be more reliable because the worst-case scenario has been considered. In addition, we introduce a variable to control the conservatism of our model, by which we can avoid over-protection. By considering pumped-storage units, the total cost is reduced significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2169817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06069602.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2169817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Unit Commitment With Wind Power and Pumped Storage Hydro","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069602/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Unit Commitment With Wind Power and Pumped Storage Hydro","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12692015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069602/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Unit Commitment With Wind Power and Pumped Storage Hydro","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2169817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095521S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"624","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6069602","onlineDate":"03 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6069603,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Oun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Il-Oun Lee (S\u201910) was born in Korea in 1976.

The TL LLC SRC discussed in this paper consists of two half-bridge LLC SRCs in series, sharing a resonant inductor and a transformer. Its main advantages are that the voltage across each switch is clamped at half of the input voltage and that voltage balance is achieved. Thus, it is suitable for high-input-voltage applications. Moreover, due to its simple driving signals, the additional circulating current of the conventional TL LLC SRCs does not appear in the converter, and a simpler driving circuitry is allowed to be designed. With this converter, the operation principles, the gain of the LLC resonant tank, and the zero-voltage-switching condition under wide input voltage variation are analyzed. Both the current and voltage stresses over different design factors of the resonant tank are discussed as well. Based on the results of these analyses, a design example is provided and its validity is confirmed by an experiment involving a prototype converter with an input of 400-600 V and an output of 48 V/20 A. In addition, a family of TL LLC SRCs with double-resonant tanks for high-input-voltage applications is introduced.

The effect of beacon transmitter placement on aggregate interference distribution and capacity-outage performance is studied, considering two scenarios of beacon transmitter placement: a beacon transmitter located 1) at a PU transmitter or 2) at a PU receiver. Based on the developed statistical models for the interference distribution, closed-form expressions for the capacity-outage probability of the PU are derived to examine the effects of various system parameters on the performance of the PU in the presence of interference from SUs. It is shown that the beacon transmitter at the PU receiver imposes less interference and, hence, better capacity-outage probability to the PU than the beacon transmitter at the PU transmitter.

Indeed, M2M is a promising technology for the development of Internet of Things communications platforms, with high potential to enable a wide range of applications in different domains. However, providing suitable answers to the issues stemming from IoT platform design requires middleware-level solutions to enable seamless interoperability between M2M-based applications and existing Internetbased services. To the best of our knowledge, available proposals in the field are still immature and tend to be proof of concept prototypes that address specific issues stemming from IoT domains. This article starts from a different perspective and aims at investigating the possibility of implementing M2M solutions on top of currently available, mature, production-level solutions. In this vein, we here present and discuss the design and implementation of an M2M application in the field of road traffic management that integrates, for the sake of efficiency, with a broad IMS-based service infrastructure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Wireless sensor networks","Intelligent vehicles","Internet","Machine intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","multimedia systems","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M2M-based metropolitan platform","IMS-enabled road traffic management","machine-to-machine communications","mobile network operators","equipment vendors","device manufacturers","middleware-level solutions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6069696/06069709.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M2M-based metropolitan platform for IMS-enabled road traffic management in IoT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"M2M-based metropolitan platform for IMS-enabled road traffic management in IoT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069709/","volume":"49","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069709/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12357013","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M2M-based metropolitan platform for IMS-enabled road traffic management in IoT","sourcePdf":"013FOSCHINILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04811S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6069696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6069696","articleId":"6069709","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6069710,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Gluhak","affiliation":["University of Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Alexander Gluhak is a senior researcher at the University of Surrey, where he works on real world information infrastructures based on the Internet of Things.

In this study, we model the vacant TV channels as a multiserver, multipriority, preemptive queue. Queueing theory has been extensively employed in the open literature to model multiple access architectures as well as analyze network performance in both wired and wireless communication frameworks. On the other hand, to the best of the authors' knowledge, not many researchers have tried to resort to a queueing theory approach to analyze dynamic spectrum access networks on a system level, including the specific case of vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA). Leveraging previously reported quantitative measurements obtained from a wireless spectrum measurement campaign conducted along a major interstate highway (I-90) located in Massachusetts, we modeled vacant TV channels as a multiserver queueing system in which available servers represent vacant TV channels. The servers become unavailable from the perspective of a vehicle in a time/location-varying fashion such that they represent spatially occupied TV channels.

A wide variety of technologies have been proposed recently with different characteristics for diverse application environments. Such emerging technologies can be applied - depending on their specific features - to different e-health use cases. Additionally, some of those technologies have already adopted a path to medical device interoperability, while others are on their way to enable that potential. Hence the need to perform an overview of such technologies, which can be useful when designing interoperable, wireless-enabled e-health solutions. This article therefore reviews the emerging technologies that can be incorporated into the complex e-health information communication ecosystem and details the transport technologies that have adopted a specialized medical profile for ISO/IEEE 11073 interoperability such as USB, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. Discussion is focused on the expected path of novel emerging technologies toward ISO/IEEE 11073-compliant medical device interoperability. As a result, this article provides an up-to-date guideline for designers of standard-compliant wireless-enabled e-health architectures, helping in the selection of the appropriate technology for their designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6069696/06069727.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends and challenges of the emerging technologies toward interoperability and standardization in e-health communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Universal Serial Bus","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Bluetooth","Wireless communication","ISO standards","Information exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","biomedical equipment","Bluetooth","Internet","medical computing","medical information systems","open systems","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information exchange","paradigm shift","wireless transport technologies","medical device interoperability","wireless-enabled e-health solutions","e-health information communication ecosystem","USB","Bluetooth","Zigbee","ISO-IEEE 11073 interoperability","standard-compliant wireless-enabled e-health architectures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Trends and challenges of the emerging technologies toward interoperability and standardization in e-health communications","volume":"49","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6069727/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12357031","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends and challenges of the emerging technologies toward interoperability and standardization in e-health communications","sourcePdf":"031ARAGUESLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057558S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6069696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6069696","articleId":"6069727","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6069807,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xue","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea","Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6165622/6069807/6069807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Xue (S'07-M'10) received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2004 and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from Inha University, Incheon, Korea, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.

An analytical model which reflects the network access features is presented. Allowing multi-homing access and resource element sharing, the RRM problem can be formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem, and the optimal solution provides upper-bound performance. In order to analyze the network selection criterion, we consider an approximated RRM problem with average resource allocations. Two different multi-homing formulations are used, and both are proven to have the same solution, where the network selection is related to the users' rate ratios between different networks. Then, we propose a low complexity suboptimal RRM algorithm, which is composed of a basic part without multi-homing access and a supplementary part with multi-homing support. The basic part makes single network selection and resource allocations. The network selection algorithm is designed based on the criterion found in the approximated problem. After network selection, an efficient resource allocation algorithm is utilized in the OFDMA network, which can employ the multi-user time and frequency diversity well. If multi-homing is allowed, the supplementary part selects the multi-homing users and reallocates partial resources to further improve the performance. Our simulation results show that the proposed suboptimal algorithm can achieve considerable gains over the previous schemes with minor performance degradation compared with the optimal solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6165622/06069807.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.102611.110281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.102611.110281","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Resource Management with Proportional Rate Constraint in the Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069807/","displayDocTitle":"Radio Resource Management with Proportional Rate Constraint in the Heterogeneous Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069807/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12578046","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Resource Management with Proportional Rate Constraint in the Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"1066-tw1203-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100295S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6165622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6165622","articleId":"6069807","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6069810,"authors":[{"name":"Jiunn-Nan Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jiunn-Nan","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37559937500"},{"name":"Shyh-Jong Chung","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37278469100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6069810","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1562},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Antenna measurements","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar inverted-F antennas","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolation enhancement","coupling element","two closely packed antenna","wireless local area network application","WLAN application","antenna element","parallel individual inverted-F antenna","isolation bandwidth","isolation frequency control","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling element","inverted-F antennas (IFAs)","isolation","wireless local area network (WLAN)"]}],"abstract":"This letter introduces a coupling element to enhance the isolation between two closely packed antennas for 2.4-GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) application.

As in many control applications full state measurements are not available for feedback, it is the objective of this paper to propose event-triggered dynamical output-based controllers. The fact that the controller is based on output feedback instead of state feedback does not allow for straightforward extensions of existing event-triggering mechanisms if a minimum time between two subsequent events has to be guaranteed. Furthermore, since sensor and actuator nodes can be physically distributed, centralized event-triggering mechanisms are often prohibitive and, therefore, we will propose a decentralized event-triggering mechanism. This event-triggering mechanism invokes transmission of the outputs in a node when the difference between the current values of the outputs in the node and their previously transmitted values becomes \u201clarge\u201d compared to the current values and an additional threshold. For such event-triggering mechanisms, we will study closed-loop stability and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n-performance and provide bounds on the minimum time between two subsequent events generated by each node, the so-called inter-event time of a node. This enables us to make tradeoffs between closed-loop performance on the one hand and communication load on the other hand, or even between the communication load of individual nodes. In addition, we will model the event-triggered control system using an impulsive model, which truly describes the behavior of the event-triggered control system. As a result, we will be able to guarantee stability and performance for event-triggered controllers with larger minimum inter-event times than the existing results in the literature.

The proposed methods accomplish this by minimizing the circuit's ratio of leakage to active current. The first method, super pipelining, increases the number of pipeline stages compared to conventional ultra low voltage (ULV) pipelining strategies, reducing the leakage/dynamic energy ratio and simultaneously improving performance and energy efficiency. Measurements of super-pipelined multipliers demonstrate 30% energy savings and 1.6\u00d7 performance improvement. Since super pipelining reduces the logic depth between registers, two-phase latch based design is employed to compensate for reduced averaging effects and provide better variation tolerance. The second technique introduces a parallel-pipelined architecture that suppresses leakage energy by ensuring full utilization of functional units and reduces memory size. We apply these techniques to a 16-b 1024-pt complex-valued Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) core along with low-power first-in first-out (FIFO) design and robust clock distribution network. The FFT core is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS and consumes 15.8 nJ/FFT with a clock frequency of 30 MHz and throughput of 240 Msamples/s at V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n=270 mV, providing 2.4\u00d7 better energy efficiency than current state-of-art and >; 10\u00d7 higher throughput than typical ULV designs.

The operation speed is today limited to 40 instructions per second. The power consumption is as low as 100 \u03bcW. The ALU-foil operates at a supply voltage of 10 V and back-gate voltage of 50 V. The microprocessor can execute user-defined programs: we demonstrate the execution of the multiplication of two 4-bit numbers and the calculation of the moving average of a string of incoming 6-bit numbers. To execute such dedicated tasks on the microprocessor, we create small plastic circuits that generate the sequences of appropriate instructions. The near transparency, mechanical flexibility, and low power consumption of the processor are attractive features for integration on everyday objects, where it could be programmed as, amongst other items, a calculator, timer, or game controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069822/","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6069822/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12425678","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An 8-Bit, 40-Instructions-Per-Second Organic Microprocessor on Plastic Foil","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8-Bit, 40-Instructions-Per-Second Organic Microprocessor on Plastic Foil","sourcePdf":"jssc-myny-2170635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07164S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6109882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6109882","articleId":"6069822","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6069827,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Formentin","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Formentin","id":"37593380700"},{"name":"Pierpaolo De Filippi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierpaolo","lastName":"De Filippi","id":"37593375700"},{"name":"Matteo Corno","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft Technical University, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Corno","id":"37402408800"},{"name":"Mara Tanelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Mara","lastName":"Tanelli","id":"37299041900"},{"name":"Sergio M.

For the various standard signals with different bandwidth (BW) and peak-to-average power ratio, the HSA efficiently provides supply signals to the PA by changing the reference value of the hysteresis comparator. The saturated amplifier employs the nonlinear output capacitor to shape the voltage waveform, resulting in the half-sinusoidal or rectangular waveform. Since the nonlinear capacitor generates large out-of-phased second harmonic component with small higher order harmonics, the voltage shaping is mainly carried out by the capacitor and slightly supported by the harmonic loading circuit. Thus, with the harmonic load higher than that of output capacitor, the saturated amplifier can operate with high efficiency. This characteristic enables the saturated PA to operate with broadband characteristic and high efficiency because the design is mainly focused on the fundamental matching problem while the harmonics can be easily kept out of a low efficiency region through the subsequent optimization of the matching circuit. The broadband saturated PA is implemented based on load/source-pull methodology. The broadband matching networks for the high efficiency are synthesized using the simplified real frequency technique. For the BW from 1.3 to 2.7 GHz (70% fractional BW), the measured output power, drain efficiency, and power-added efficiency (PAE) performances are between 39.8-42.0 dBm, 55.8-69.7%, and 51.2-65.3%, respectively. The multimode/multiband ET transmitter with the designed broadband saturated PA is demonstrated at 1.8425-GHz long-term evolution (LTE), 2.14-GHz wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), and 2.6-GHz mobile world wide interoperability for microwave access (m-WiMAX) applications.

It is therefore natural to use admittance parameter descriptions of linear networks, preferably in the form of rational transfer functions that can be directly implemented in the analysis. A problem arises when the measured or calculated frequency-domain response of a linear distributed network must be derived from data that has inherent error, is of limited bandwidth, or is not in the appropriate rational form. A reduced-order rational model that is causal, stable, and passive must be developed. Previous methods of deriving rational functions for the admittance parameters of a network do guarantee stability and causality, but passivity of the model must be assured through subsequent post-processing. Enforcing passivity requires modification of the state-space parameters of the model with consequent introduction of errors. This paper reports on a procedure to simultaneously achieve passivity, accuracy, causality, and stability in the development of an admittance macromodel described using a matrix of rational functions. An iterative inverse eigenvalue algorithm enforces passivity, and is applied by conjoining sets of eigenvalue and admittance constraints. These constraints form a monolithic projection matrix, which simultaneously addresses both passivity and accuracy of the model.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6112732/06069830.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2171500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity Enforcement for Admittance Models of Distributed Networks Using an Inverse Eigenvalue Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069830/","displayDocTitle":"Passivity Enforcement for Admittance Models of Distributed Networks Using an Inverse Eigenvalue Method","volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12427046","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069830/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity Enforcement for Admittance Models of Distributed Networks Using an Inverse Eigenvalue Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-saunders-2171500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113912S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6112732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6112732","articleId":"6069830","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069834,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Lavretsky","affiliation":["Boeing AeroSpace Company, Huntington Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Lavretsky","id":"37299176000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6069834","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1303},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Aerodynamics","Observers","Uncertainty","Output feedback","Vehicles","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aerospace control","asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","linear quadratic Gaussian control","linearisation techniques","matrix multiplication","MIMO systems","observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic properties","LQG/LTR controllers","observer-based adaptive output feedback tracking control design","multiple-input multiple-output dynamical systems","matched uncertainties","LQG/LTR regulators","sufficient conditions","closed loop stability","uniform ultimate boundedness","tracking error dynamics","linearized dynamics","system output-to-input matrix product","full column rank","pseudocontrol signals","minimum-phase dynamics","squaring-up problem","controllable observable triplet","nonminimum phase","MIMO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flight control","optimal and adaptive control","output feedback"]}],"abstract":"This technical note introduces an observer-based adaptive output feedback tracking control design for multi-input-multi-output dynamical systems with matched uncertainties. The reported methodology exploits asymptotic behavior of LQG/LTR regulators. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability and uniform ultimate boundedness of the corresponding tracking error dynamics are formulated. This method is valid for systems whose nominal linearized dynamics are controllable and observable. We assume that the number of the system measured outputs (sensors) is greater than the number of the control inputs (actuators) and that the system output-to-input matrix product has full column rank. In this case, the system can be \u201csquared-up\u201d (i.e., augmented) using pseudo-control signals to yield relative degree one minimum-phase dynamics. Since it is known that the \u201csquaring-up\u201d problem is solvable for any controllable observable triplet (A, B, C), the proposed design is applicable to systems whose regulated output dynamics may be non-minimum phase or have a high relative degree.

DVC is built on distributed source coding (DSC) principles where correlation between sources to be compressed is exploited at the decoder side. In the case of DVC, a current frame available only at the encoder is estimated at the decoder with side information generated from other frames available at the decoder. One of the main challenges in DVC design is that correlation among the source and side information needs to be estimated online and as accurately as possible. Since correlation dynamically changes with the scene, in order to exploit the robustness of DSC code designs, we integrate particle filtering (PF) with standard belief propagation (BP) decoding for inference on one joint factor graph to estimate correlation among source and side information. Correlation estimation is performed online as it is carried out jointly with decoding of the graph-based DSC code. Moreover, we demonstrate our joint bit-plane decoding with adaptive correlation estimation schemes within state-of-the-art DVC systems, which are transform-domain based with a feedback channel for rate adaptation. Experimental results show that our proposed system gives a significant performance improvement compared to the benchmark state-of-the-art DISCOVER codec (including correlation estimation) and the case without dynamic PF tracking, due to improved knowledge of timely correlation statistics via the combination of joint bit-plane decoding and particle-based BP (PBP) tracking.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6193248/06069852.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2171263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2171263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6193248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Correlation Estimation With Particle Filtering for Distributed Video Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Decoding","Estimation","Encoding","Noise","Joints","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decoding","adaptive estimation","filtering theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive correlation estimation","particle filtering","distributed video coding","video encoding complexity reduction","DVC design","belief propagation decoding","joint factor graph","joint bit-plane decoding","correlation statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive decoding; distributed video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Correlation Estimation With Particle Filtering for Distributed Video Coding","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6069852/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12695192","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Correlation Estimation With Particle Filtering for Distributed Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-stankovic-2171263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144172S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6193248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6193248","articleId":"6069852","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069859,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Bayati","affiliation":["Graduate School of Business, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohsen Bayati is an assistant professor of operations, information, and technology at Stanford university Graduate School of Business.

Various technology considerations are presented, including the optimization of the power-switching transistor and passives integration. Two design examples for integrated dc-dc converters are implemented in a 0.5-\u03bcm GaAs E/D pHEMT process. The first uses coupled inductors to reduce the current ripple and enhance the dynamic performance of the converter. The two-phase, 0.5 A/phase converter occupies 2 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm without the output network. An 8.7-nH filter coupled inductor is implemented in 65-\u03bcm-thick top copper metal layer, and flip-chip bonded to the dc-dc converter board. The presented converter converts 4.5-V input to 3.3-V output at 150-MHz switching frequency with a measured power efficiency of 84%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for similar current/voltage ratings. The second example is a hysteric controlled, 100-MHz switching frequency single-phase GaAs pHEMT buck converter designed to drive power amplifier loads. The design can deliver up to 37-dB\u00b7m output power and has a peak efficiency of 88% and a 3-dB bandwidth of 14.5 MHz.","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06069868.pdf","startPage":"2644","endPage":"2656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2174803","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2174803","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069868","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Resistance","PHEMTs","Switches","Gallium arsenide","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","power HEMT","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated high-frequency power converters","pHEMT technology","high-frequency power-switching convertor","integrated power supply","portable wireless systems","power-switching transistor","integrated DC-DC converters","E/D pHEMT process","current ripple","filter coupled inductor","phase converter","top copper metal layer","flip-chip","switching frequency single-phase pHEMT buck converter","power amplifier loads","size 0.5 mum","current 0.5 A","size 65 mum","voltage 4.5 V to 3.3 V","frequency 150 MHz","efficiency 84 percent","frequency 100 MHz","efficiency 88 percent","bandwidth 4.5 MHz","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC power conversion","GaAs technology","power amplifier linearization","power FET switches"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Integrated High-Frequency Power Converters Based on GaAs pHEMT: Technology Characterization and Design Examples","accessionNumber":"12571276","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6069868/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated High-Frequency Power Converters Based on GaAs pHEMT: Technology Characterization and Design Examples","sourcePdf":"tpel-hella-2174803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136539S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6069868","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6069870,"authors":[{"name":"W.X.

The mathematical formulation established can in principle be used to analyze wireless resonator systems with various domino forms. In this study, it is used to analyze and evaluate wireless domino-resonator systems with circular structures because such structures have more than one main power flow paths and have not been analyzed previously. Based on the superposition method, individual power flow paths are analyzed and then their interactions are emerged and explained with vector diagrams. Unlike the resonator pair used by Tesla, it is demonstrated that optimization of the domino systems can be achieved under \u201cnonresonance frequency\u201d operation and optimal load conditions. The shift of the optimal frequency from the resonance frequency is due to the multiple power flow paths. The theoretical results have been favorably verified with practical measurements obtained from two circular systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12805005","htmlLink":"/document/6069870/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless power domino-resonator systems with noncoaxial axes and circular structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless power domino-resonator systems with noncoaxial axes and circular structures","sourcePdf":"tpel-hui-2174655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103519S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6222041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6222041","articleId":"6069870","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6069872,"authors":[{"name":"Mansour Mohseni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6170969/6069872/6069872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mansour Mohseni (S\u201909\u2013M\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical power engineering from Shahid Chamran University, Ahwaz, Iran, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Curtin University, Perth, Australia, in 2011.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University.

The new grid code requires wind generators to ride-through severe low- and high-voltage conditions, provides reactive power support during the fault period, and exhibits fast power recovery after the supply voltage restoration. This paper proposes a new control scheme for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WPPs to fulfill these requirements in one inclusive approach. New design strategies for the outer power control loops of DFIG are suggested and their corresponding P-Q capability curves are rigorously studied. It is shown that safely overloaded converters can enhance the reactive power capability of DFIGs during the fault periods. Moreover, for the inner current control loops, the conventional PI current regulators are replaced with enhanced hysteresis-based current regulators. This current regulator, with very fast transient response, increases low- and high-voltage ride-through capabilities of the DFIG, as requested by the Australian Grid Code. Finally, time-domain simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the capability of the proposed control scheme to fulfill the Australian regulations and examine its positive impacts on the transient response of the adjacent fixed-speed WPP.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2174380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170969","startPage":"2813","endPage":"2824","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6170969/06069872.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE

So far, most PSO algorithms use a single learning pattern for all particles, which means that all particles in a swarm use the same strategy. This monotonic learning pattern may cause the lack of intelligence for a particular particle, which makes it unable to deal with different complex situations. This paper presents a novel algorithm, called self-learning particle swarm optimizer (SLPSO), for global optimization problems. In SLPSO, each particle has a set of four strategies to cope with different situations in the search space. The cooperation of the four strategies is implemented by an adaptive learning framework at the individual level, which can enable a particle to choose the optimal strategy according to its own local fitness landscape. The experimental study on a set of 45 test functions and two real-world problems show that SLPSO has a superior performance in comparison with several other peer algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2171946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6198838/06069879.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2171946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for Global Optimization Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for Global Optimization Problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069879/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12713249","pubMedId":"22067435","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069879/","volume":"42","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Self-Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for Global Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-li-2171946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206516S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6198838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"6198838","articleId":"6069879","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6069880,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["ECIT, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6069880/6069880-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huiqin Du (M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic information science and technology from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree with distinction in radio frequency communication systems from University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2010.","She is currently a Research Fellow in the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science of Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K. Her current research interests include statistical signal processing, wireless MIMO communications, cognitive radio network, and interference alignment."]},"firstName":"Huiqin","lastName":"Du","id":"37708277700"},{"name":"Tharmalingam Ratnarajah","affiliation":["ECIT, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6069880/6069880-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tharmalingam Ratnarajah (A'96\u2013M'05\u2013SM'05) received the B.Eng.

With the perfect knowledge of all links, the optimal secondary transceiver beam former is achieved iteratively. Due to the limited cooperation between SBS and PUs, perfect information of primary links may not be available at SBS which could lead to severe interference to the PUs. Robust designs are developed against the uncertainties in the primary links by keeping the interference to the PU below a prespecifled threshold with high probability.

This paper seeks to develop estimation and detection algorithms that enable cooperative communications for both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks in the presence of MCFOs, MTOs, and unknown channel gains. A novel transceiver structure at the relays for achieving synchronization in AF-relaying networks is proposed. New exact closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation problem are derived. Next, two iterative algorithms based on the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms are proposed for jointly estimating MCFOs, MTOs, and channel gains at the destination. Though the global convergence of the proposed ECM and SAGE estimators cannot be shown analytically, numerical simulations indicate that through appropriate initialization the proposed algorithms can estimate channel and synchronization impairments in a few iterations. Finally, a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder is devised for decoding the received signal at the destination in the presence of MCFOs and MTOs. Simulation results show that through the application of the proposed estimation and decoding methods, cooperative systems result in significant performance gains even in presence of impairments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06069882.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing and Carrier Synchronization With Channel Estimation in Multi-Relay Cooperative Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069882/","displayDocTitle":"Timing and Carrier Synchronization With Channel Estimation in Multi-Relay Cooperative Networks","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471559","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6069882/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing and Carrier Synchronization With Channel Estimation in Multi-Relay Cooperative Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-mehrpouyan-2174792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129883S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6069882","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069883,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Luiz Rebelatto","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6069883/6069883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jo\u00e3o Luiz Rebelatto (S'07) was born in Lapa-PR, Brazil, in 1984.

The aim is to increase the diversity order of the system without reducing its throughput. The proposed scheme, called generalized dynamic-network codes (GDNC), is a generalization of the dynamic-network codes (DNC) recently proposed by Xiao and Skoglund. The design of the network codes that maximize the diversity order is recognized as equivalent to the design of linear block codes over a nonbinary finite field under the Hamming metric. We prove that adopting a systematic generator matrix of a maximum distance separable block code over a sufficiently large finite field as the network transfer matrix is a sufficient condition for full diversity order under link failure model. The proposed generalization offers a much better tradeoff between rate and diversity order compared to the DNC. An outage probability analysis showing the improved performance is carried out, and computer simulations results are shown to agree with the analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Cooperative Diversity Through Network Coding Based on Classical Coding Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174787","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06069883.pdf","startPage":"916","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Cooperative Diversity Through Network Coding Based on Classical Coding Theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6069883/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471560","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Cooperative Diversity Through Network Coding Based on Classical Coding Theory","sourcePdf":"tsp-rebelatto-2174787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074889S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6069883","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069884,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Abumansoor","affiliation":["PARADISE Research Laboratory, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6129945/6069884/6069884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Osama Abumansoor (M'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The data are exchanged among vehicles within each vehicle's respective radio communication range through direct communication. In reality, direct communication is susceptible to interference and blocked by physical obstacles, which prevent the proper exchange of information about localization information. Obstacles can create a state of nonline of sight (NLOS) between two vehicles, which restricts direct communication even when corresponding vehicles exist within each other's physical communication range, thus preventing them from exchanging proper data and affecting the localization services' integrity and reliability. Dealing with such obstacles is a challenge in VANETs as moving obstacles such as trucks are parts of the network and have the same characteristics of a VANET node (e.g., high-speed mobility and change of driving behavior). In this paper, we present a location verification protocol among cooperative neighboring vehicles to overcome an NLOS condition and secure the integrity of localization services for VANETs. The simulation results showed improvement in neighborhood awareness under NLOS conditions. A solution such as that we propose will help to maintain localization service integrity and reliability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2174465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"275","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06069884.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure Cooperative Approach for Nonline-of-Sight Location Verification in VANET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6069884/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Secure Cooperative Approach for Nonline-of-Sight Location Verification in VANET","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471787","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Cooperative Approach for Nonline-of-Sight Location Verification in VANET","sourcePdf":"tvt-abumansoor-2174465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077692S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6069884","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6069885,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyang Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Ding","id":"37403556000"},{"name":"Jianhua Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Ge","id":"37273602800"},{"name":"Daniel Benevides da Costa","affiliation":["Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Sobral, Ceara, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Benevides","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Yi Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37403658800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6069885","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":742},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Relays","Network topology","Multiuser detection","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","decode and forward communication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrally efficient diversity exploitation","downlink cooperative cellular networks","base station","mobile users","half-duplex decode-and-forward relay","spectrum-efficiency enhancement","homogeneous network topology","scheduling","high-signal-to-noise-ratio regime","heterogeneous network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","incremental relaying","opportunistic scheduling","outage behavior"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we advocate the exploitation of direct links for downlink cooperative cellular networks, where one base station (source) communicates with one out of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n mobile users (destinations) by using a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Motivated by the potential spectrum-efficiency enhancement, we propose two spectrally efficient schemes for the diversity exploitation of the considered systems in a homogeneous network topology. By scheduling the user with the best direct link to access the channel, an incremental DF relaying scheme is first presented, and its outage behavior is analyzed, revealing that this scheme can achieve full diversity order (N + 1). To further enhance transmission robustness against fading (in terms of outage probability), an improved scheme is also proposed, which substantially utilizes the opportunistic scheduling mechanism when the direct transmission fails. Outage analysis for this scheme shows that, aside from achieving full diversity order, it can further improve the transmission reliability to fading, compared with the preceding one. In addition, it is indicated that the expected spectral efficiency of the proposed schemes approaches that of direct transmission in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, adjustment of the proposed schemes for heterogeneous network topology is presented, and the corresponding outage behavior is characterized as well.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2174661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06069885.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2174661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"386","endPage":"393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally Efficient Diversity Exploitation Schemes for Downlink Cooperative Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6069885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally Efficient Diversity Exploitation Schemes for Downlink Cooperative Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471788","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6069885/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally Efficient Diversity Exploitation Schemes for Downlink Cooperative Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ding-2174661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058901S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6069885","onlineDate":"04 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6069931,"authors":[{"name":"Idongesit E.

The most likely candidate for early adoption is the nonvolatile memory due to the small cell size (increased scaling potential), increased density as compared to flash, and ability to stack these devices in a crossbar structure. This paper analyzes the feasibility of a memristor memory and introduces an adaptive read, write, and erase method that may be used to realize a more resilient memory system in the face of low yield in the nanotechnology regime. The proposed method is evaluated in simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) and a hand analysis model is extracted to help explain the sources of power and energy consumption. Finally, the power metrics are compared to flash memory technology, and the memristor memory is shown to have an energy per bit consumption about one-tenth that of flash when programming, comparable to flash when erasing, and about one-fourth of flash when reading.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2011.2166805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6069913/06069931.pdf","startPage":"1454","endPage":"1463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2011.2166805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Controlled Writing and Erasing in a Memristor Crossbar Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6069931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Self-Controlled Writing and Erasing in a Memristor Crossbar Memory","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12332246","htmlLink":"/document/6069931/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Controlled Writing and Erasing in a Memristor Crossbar Memory","sourcePdf":"tnano-ebong-2166805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050485S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6069913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6069913","articleId":"6069931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
