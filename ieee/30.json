The NN in the proposed structure performs two functions. The first is to identify the nonlinear system dynamics at all times. Hence, detailed and elaborate models for the DC brushless machines are not needed. Furthermore, unknown nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to model such as load disturbances, system noise and parameter variations can be recognized by the trained neural network. The second function of the NN is to control the motor voltage so that the speed and position are made to follow pre-selected tracks (trajectories) at all times. The control action emulated by the NN is based on the indirect model reference adaptive control. A hardware laboratory setup is utilized to test and evaluate the proposed neural network structure. The paper shows, based on the laboratory test results, that the proposed neural network structure performance was good: the tracking accuracy was very high and the system robustness was quite evident even in the presence of random and severe disturbances.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4738352","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High performance drive of DC brushless motors using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance drive of DC brushless motors using neural network","sourcePdf":"00300142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041618S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"79","articleId":"300142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":300147,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Such partial discharge tests are sensitive to problems associated with overheated insulation, loose stator bars, and pollution, all of which can cause in-service failures with long associated outages and high repair/rewind costs. Unfortunately, the partial discharge test is not widely applied since present test methods require considerable skill to perform, and/or require machine outages. These problems are due to the stator winding partial discharges being masked by high levels of internal and external electrical noise. The authors describe how partial discharge tests have now been developed which eliminate the effect of noise, thus allowing plant personnel to perform the test without any machine outage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.300147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.300147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7424","startPage":"281","endPage":"287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/7424/00300147.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=300147","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Turbines","Insulation testing","Stator windings","Performance evaluation","Stator bars","Pollution","Costs","Noise level","Personnel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","turbogenerators","insulation testing","machine insulation","insulation testing","machine insulation","electric breakdown","electric breakdown","partial discharges","partial discharges","stators","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge testing","turbine generators","motors","stator winding insulation","overheated insulation","loose stator bars","in-service failures","pollution","machine outages","electrical noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical on-line partial discharge tests for turbine generators and motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4738347","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300147/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical on-line partial discharge tests for turbine generators and motors","sourcePdf":"00300147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042249S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"63","articleId":"300147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":300149,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

A desire to gain the ability to evaluate hydrogenerator governors (speed controllers) in forms completely equivalent to that which could be used to control actual hydrogenerators is the primary motivation for this work. The simulator is designed so that one linear system may be conceptualized as an error controller while the second system may be thought of as a plant under control. The simulator is specialized in that it allows direct entry of the hydrogenerator system parameter values of one of two linearized hydrogenerating system plant models. An option to enter the gains of a generic PID controller also exists. This PID controller may be utilized to simulate a governor for a hydrogenerator, thus allowing the real-time simulation of a closed-loop speed-controlled hydrogenerating system. Simulation accuracy is established by comparing computed results to those computed by an accepted \"standard\" software package. An IBM-compatible personal computer and a modified Texas Instruments TMS320C30 digital signal processor evaluation module are the primary hardware used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.300153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7424","startPage":"238","endPage":"242","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/7424/00300153.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.300153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generic DSP-based real-time simulator with application to hydrogenerator speed controller development","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Digital signal processors","Computer simulation","Linear systems","Real time systems","Three-term control","Application software","Error correction","Software packages","Microcomputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric generators","electric generators","machine control","velocity control","digital signal processing chips","digital simulation","electric machine analysis computing","closed loop systems","three-term control","linear systems","controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP-based real-time simulator","hydrogenerator speed controller","digital signal processor","personal computer","linear systems simulation","speed controllers","error controller","generic PID controller","closed-loop system","IBM-compatible personal computer","modified Texas Instruments TMS320C30 DSP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A generic DSP-based real-time simulator with application to hydrogenerator speed controller development","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4738341","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generic DSP-based real-time simulator with application to hydrogenerator speed controller development","sourcePdf":"00300153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03409S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"8","articleId":"300153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":300160,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

We compare several node configurations, and find that the sequence of an EDFA followed by an optical tap and a channel dropping filter provides the highest performance for a wide range in system variables including input signal power, inter-node link loss and its variability, power-tapping ratio, and small-signal gain. Limited network modularity can he achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical fiber networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber losses","Optical fiber filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","optical links","wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibres","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optically-amplified WDM ring network","channel-dropping filters","critical parameters","EDFA","nonamplified rings","node configurations","optical tap","system variables","input signal power","inter-node link loss","power-tapping ratio","small-signal gain","Er-doped fibre amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.300186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7425/00300186.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.300186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optically-amplified WDM ring network incorporating channel-dropping filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=300186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optically-amplified WDM ring network incorporating channel-dropping filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300186/","volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4743273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optically-amplified WDM ring network incorporating channel-dropping filters","sourcePdf":"00300186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029781S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"8","articleId":"300186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":300251,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Musashi Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Ying Li","id":"37350649500"},{"name":"M.

Initially the PEA method could indicate the space charge distribution in the materials only indirectly. Some data processing, for example deconvolution, was necessary to obtain the charge profile. Some very important improvements were made recently to the PEA method which eliminated the need for deconvolution. This paper describes the latest improvements and the practical construction of the detecting electrode system under which the output signal is linearly proportional to the space charge distribution. Nowadays the PEA method can be used to measure the space charge distribution with or without DC electrical stress, not only in free-standing dielectric plates but also directly in coaxial cables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.300251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","startPage":"188","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/7428/00300251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.300251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsed electroacoustic method for measurement of charge accumulation in solid dielectrics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulsed electroacoustic methods","Current measurement","Charge measurement","Pulse measurements","Space charge","Deconvolution","Acoustic measurements","Acoustic pulses","Solids","Acoustic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge measurement","space charge","acoustoelectric effects","acoustic wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsed electroacoustic method","measurement","charge accumulation","solid dielectrics","space charge distribution","detecting electrode system","free-standing dielectric plates","coaxial cables","DC electrical stress"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Pulsed electroacoustic method for measurement of charge accumulation in solid dielectrics","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4678567","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300251/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsed electroacoustic method for measurement of charge accumulation in solid dielectrics","sourcePdf":"00300251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036865S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"331","articleId":"300251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":300258,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of artificial NN in electric field problems, a simple cylindrical electrode system is designed first where the stresses can be computed analytically. It is found that once trained, the NN can give results with mean absolute error of /spl sim/1% when compared with analytically obtained results. In the next section of the paper, a multilayer feedforward NN with a back-propagation algorithm is designed for electrode contour optimization. The NN is first trained with the results of electric field computations for some predetermined contours of an axisymmetric electrode arrangement. Then the trained NN is used to give an optimized electrode contour in such a way that a desired stress distribution is obtained on the electrode surface. The results from the present study show that the trained NN can give optimized electrode contours to get a desired stress distribution on the electrode surface very efficiently and accurately.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4678574","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of artificial neural networks for optimization of electrode contour","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of artificial neural networks for optimization of electrode contour","sourcePdf":"00300258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088832S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"22","articleId":"300258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":300259,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Schottky emission was observed for both PZT capacitors. An accelerated unified test technique which can measure fatigue and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) simultaneously in a short period of time was suggested. Schottky barrier heights are asymmetric between top and bottom electrodes, probably because of different electrode processing conditions during capacitor fabrication. PZT capacitors with RuO/sub x/ show earlier electrical degradation than those with Pt electrodes under DC electric field. However, films on RuO/sub x/ show better breakdown properties under AC field because of a healing effect due to better lattice match between PZT and electrodes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"ISAF '92: Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics","displayPublicationTitle":"ISAF '92: Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics","pdfPath":"/iel3/1016/7437/00300669.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00300669.png","startPage":"225","endPage":"228","doi":"10.1109/ISAF.1992.300669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAF.1992.300669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage current mechanism and accelerated unified test of lead zirconate titanate thin film capacitors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/300669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug-2 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Leakage current mechanism and accelerated unified test of lead zirconate titanate thin film capacitors","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4695229","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-2 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage current mechanism and accelerated unified test of lead zirconate titanate thin film capacitors","confLoc":"Greenville, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"00300669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028901S","chronDate":"30 Aug-2 Sep 1992","isNumber":"7437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1016","citationCount":"7","articleId":"300669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":300674,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

Neither a significant decrease in the polarization nor an increase in the leakage current was observed under unipolar stress. The fatigue effects are explained by an increase in the space-charge regions near the electrodes or oxygen-deficient dendrite growth. A static I-V measurement method for ferroelectric thin films was developed to distinguish the leakage current from the switching current.

It is concluded that the Tektronix SHPi process appears to offer sufficient radiation hardness for the design of fast, low-power amplifier circuits for the Superconducting Super Collider.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1992.301437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel2/1042/7439/00301437.pdf","startPage":"819","endPage":"821 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1992.301437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation hardness measurements on bipolar test structures and an amplifier-comparator circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Radiation hardness measurements on bipolar test structures and an amplifier-comparator circuit","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-31 Oct. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4744398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation hardness measurements on bipolar test structures and an amplifier-comparator circuit","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00301437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035475S","chronDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","isNumber":"7439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1042","citationCount":"5","articleId":"301437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":301440,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The greatest challenge in the trigger is finding methods which suppress the machine background without using lengthy pattern recognition algorithms with prohibitive computing times. This task is optimally suited to a neural network solution. In the present research it is shown that feedforward networks, trained on the topological energy sums from the H1 calorimeter and on first-level tracking trigger information, provide an additional background suppression factor compared to the traditional method which operates with fixed thresholds. The neural network algorithm-implemented by special-purpose fast matrix-vector multiplier chips at the second level of the trigger-allows the lowering of the first-level thresholds, which is important for obtaining good efficiencies for specific physics event classes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1992.301440","startPage":"825","endPage":"827 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1992.301440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7439","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel2/1042/7439/00301440.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A second level neural network trigger in the H1 experiment at HERA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301440/","displayDocTitle":"A second level neural network trigger in the H1 experiment at HERA","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4744400","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-31 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A second level neural network trigger in the H1 experiment at HERA","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00301440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030527S","chronDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","isNumber":"7439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1042","citationCount":"2","articleId":"301440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":301443,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Another net (Tracknet) was made to reconstruct tracks from three decks of chambers. Tracknet has six inputs, three from the Padnet outputs and three from the transit time measurements. Tracknet maps these six inputs into a single output which is proportional to the distance from the colliding beam interaction axis.

The network has been trained to compensate for collimator effects and attenuation. The required ramp filtering is also learned by the ANN. A supervised training scheme was utilized that implemented the generalized delta rule. After training, the backprojection weights were held constant and could be used to reconstruct source distributions other than those used while training. A noiseless Hoffman brain phantom reconstruction using the proposed technique has a 82.5% reduction in mean-squared error (MSE) compared to standard filtered backprojection (FBP) when collimator and attenuation effects were present. For noisy data, if standard noise reduction filters were implemented prior to reconstruction, the ANN images has a lower MSE than standard FBP images that used the same noise filter. For example, Wiener-filtered, 200000 count Hoffman brain projection data reconstruction by the present network had a 50% lower MSE than standard FBP images reconstructed with the same Wiener-filtered data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301508/","accessionNumber":"4710418","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-31 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A spatially-variant SPECT reconstruction scheme using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spatially-variant SPECT reconstruction scheme using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00301508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072007S","chronDate":"25-31 Oct 1992","isNumber":"7439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1042","citationCount":"2","articleId":"301508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":301632,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Li","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"lastName":"Linlin Li","id":"37311027900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9197"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1713"}],"articleNumber":"301632","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":464},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"The static and dynamic properties of injection-locked semiconductor lasers considering the influence of nonlinear gain are presented systematically. Depending on locking conditions, the modulation bandwidth of a semiconductor laser may be increased or decreased by external light injection. However, the relaxation resonance frequency and the damping rate as defined for a solitary Fabry-Perot (FP) laser are always enhanced by injection locking. That is, contrary to that in a solitary FP laser, the modulation bandwidth in an injection-locked laser is not determined solely by the relaxation resonance frequency, because an injection-locked laser is a third-order system. Therefore, a new definition of the modulation bandwidth is presented for such a laser. The performances of injection-locked distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are also discussed.

The measured amplification characteristics of a /spl lambda//4 DFB laser injected with a 2.5 Gb/s signal show good agreement with theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.301640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7447/00301640.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1768","doi":"10.1109/3.301640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant optical amplification in a laser diode: theory and experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Resonant optical amplification in a laser diode: theory and experiment","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767503","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant optical amplification in a laser diode: theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00301640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033374S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"12","articleId":"301640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":301641,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The theory is applicable to dopants such as erbium, neodymium, thulium; praseodymium, and ytterbium. Fiber-amplifier gain is expressed in terms of attenuation coefficients, intrinsic saturation powers, and cross-saturation powers at the pump and signal wavelengths. These parameters can be directly determined from one- and two-beam fiber-transmission measurements. System-independent formulas are given for the slopes and thresholds of ring and linear fiber lasers. Good agreement between theory and experiment has been shown for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers and thulium-doped fiber lasers. Because of the finite-pump-level lifetime, three- and four-level models predict a flattening of the fiber laser slope at higher pumping powers when the fiber is shorter than the optimum length. Approximate system-independent solutions are also given for fiber amplifiers with excited-state absorption at either the pump or signal wavelengths. A novel technique, requiring only one tunable light source, is proposed for finding the best pump wavelength when pump ESA is present. The two-level analytical model recently developed for erbium-doped fibers is a special case of this theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.301646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.301646","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1830","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7447/00301646.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical model for rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analytical model for rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4767509","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301646/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical model for rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers","sourcePdf":"00301646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039729S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"128","articleId":"301646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":301648,"authors":[{"name":"E.

By using the NALM the ratio of the signal peak to ASE was improved from 17.4:1 to 24.9:1. A similar result was obtained for a nonlinear optical-loop mirror (NOLM) with a 6:4 directional coupler. It is noted that pulse transmission through the NALM or the NOLM gives rise to frequency chirp, which means that these fiber devices are not appropriate for use at the midpoint of a long-distance soliton transmission. The chirp characteristics caused by the NALM were also described and the optimum condition for nonlinear switching was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.301648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1842","endPage":"1850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7447/00301648.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.301648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of amplified spontaneous emission from a transmitted soliton signal using a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror and a nonlinear optical loop mirror","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spontaneous emission","Solitons","Mirrors","Chirp","Concatenated codes","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optical devices","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","superradiance","optical solitons","mirrors","laser accessories","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplified spontaneous emission","transmitted soliton signal","nonlinear optical loop mirror","nonlinear amplifying loop mirror","concatenated Er-doped fiber amplifiers","soliton transmission system","signal peak","pulse transmission","frequency chirp","fiber devices","long-distance soliton transmission","chirp characteristics","nonlinear switching","10 Gbit/s","500 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of amplified spontaneous emission from a transmitted soliton signal using a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror and a nonlinear optical loop mirror","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4767511","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301648/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of amplified spontaneous emission from a transmitted soliton signal using a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror and a nonlinear optical loop mirror","sourcePdf":"00301648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088596S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"28","articleId":"301648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":301649,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Using intracavity negative group-velocity-dispersion compensation, nearly transform-limited femtosecond pulses of 48 fs (FWHM) duration were generated with average TEM/sub 00/ output powers of 380 mW at 1.23 /spl mu/m.

We will see that this duality leads naturally to the conclusion that a quadratic phase modulation in time is the analog of a thin lens in space. Therefore, by a suitable combination of dispersion and quadratic phase modulation (now a \"time lens\"), we can synthesize the time-domain analog of an imaging system. Such a temporal-imaging system can magnify time waveforms in the same manner as conventional spatial-imaging systems magnify scenes. We analyze this space-time duality and derive expressions for the focal length and f-number of a time lens. In addition, the principles of temporal imaging are developed and we derive time-domain analogs for the imaging condition, magnification ratio, and impulse response of a temporal-imaging system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time duality and the theory of temporal imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.301659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7447/00301659.pdf","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.301659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Space-time duality and the theory of temporal imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767522","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time duality and the theory of temporal imaging","sourcePdf":"00301659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"432","articleId":"301659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":301682,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Le-Huy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Laval University, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Hoang Le-Huy","id":"37352492600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"301682","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Motion control","Control systems","Electric motors","Microcontrollers","Real time systems","Digital signal processors","Digital signal processing","Concurrent computing","Reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","electric drives","machine control","position control","microcomputer applications","digital signal processing chips","microcontrollers","reduced instruction set computing","parallel processing","application specific integrated circuits","real-time systems","control systems","digital integrated circuits","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital IC","motion control","microprocessors","electric motor drives","microcontrollers","real-time control systems","reduced-instruction-set computing","digital signal processors","DSP","RISC","parallel processors","debugging tools","application-specific integrated circuits","ASIC","development tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301682","doi":"10.1109/5.301682","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","abstract":"This paper reviews the developments in microprocessors and digital ICs with a special attention to applications to motion control. First, the use of microprocessors and digital ICs in the control of electric motor drives is considered. General-purpose microprocessors and microcontrollers are then presented with emphasis on features that are necessary for the implementation of real-time control systems. High-performance advanced processors such as digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced-instruction-set computing (RISC) processors, and parallel processors are studied. Development and debugging tools required for developing sophisticated microprocessor-based control systems are considered. The capabilities of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in motion control and their design process are examined. Typical application examples illustrating research work in digital motion control using microprocessors and digital ICs are presented. The potentials of new devices are considered for application to high-performance drive systems.

The fundamental possibilities to control average power in a switching mode are considered and the concepts switching function, converter topology and converter structure defined. A systematic approach to developing more complicated topologies and structures for singular and composite converters is discussed and application to motion control systems given. A functional classification of motion control converters is also related to the switching nature of the power processing, illustrating the fundamental dilemma of this kind of highly efficient power control. The different control possibilities of using power electronic converters with electrical machines in motion control applications (DC drives, AC drives) are reviewed systematically. The paper does not attempt to compile a comprehensive list of all possible converter circuits and variations but focusses on generic issues and technologies. The switching technology in converters and its limitations is related to snubberless, snubbed, and resonant transition-type operation, with reference also to switch drive and converter protection technology. Some future generic possibilities related to electromagnetic integration of switching converters are discussed, also in relation to a motion control application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"82","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776409","displayDocTitle":"Power electronic converters for motion control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power electronic converters for motion control","sourcePdf":"00301683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18578S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"17","articleId":"301683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":301684,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In a modern electrical drive system, it is required to take not only the electrical aspect but also the mechanical phase into total system consideration. Improvement in electrical aspect needs a variety of information pertaining to electrical machines and power electronic circuits for improving AC variable-speed drives. Important techniques of identification or estimation of parameters and control variables in AC drives are explained. Such information includes machine parameters, flux, speed, position, and so on. Also, the paper shows that there is some theoretical limit of performance. For improvement of the mechanical phase, the disturbance torque is the most important variable to be identified. It is used in motion control systems, for example, in the feedback loop. Various applications are possible by modification of such a basic approach. As a conclusion, the paper shows that the total robustness is attained by integrating advances of control technique on the electrical aspect and the mechanical aspect.

The formulation is applied to scattering by inhomogeneous bodies of revolution. To avoid spurious modes in the interior region a combination of vector and nodal based finite elements are used. Integral equations in the exterior region are used to enforce the Sommerfeld radiation condition by matching both the tangential electric and magnetic fields between interior and exterior regions. Results from this symmetric formulation as well as formulations based solely on the EFIE or MFIE are compared to exact series solutions and integral equation solutions for a number of examples.

The derivation is based on a vector one-way wave equation and a polynomial approximation of the vector radical. It is shown that wide-angle absorbing boundary conditions, as proposed in Halpern and Trefethen (1988) for optimal absorption of out-going waves, can be obtained in vector form. Vector plane waves are used to evaluate the accuracy and the reflection performance of these boundary conditions in a wide range of incidence angles. The implementation of the vector ABCs in a FEM formulation is also provided to show how up to the fifth-order absorbing accuracy can be achieved with derivatives only up to the second-order. A possible formulation is described which not only yields a third-order accuracy with first-order derivatives, but also retains the symmetry of the FEM matrix.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.301715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7449/00301715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.301715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7449","startPage":"872","endPage":"878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector one-way wave absorbing boundary conditions for FEM applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vector one-way wave absorbing boundary conditions for FEM applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4756120","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector one-way wave absorbing boundary conditions for FEM applications","sourcePdf":"00301715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071084S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","articleId":"301715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":301717,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The noise figures of amplifiers subjected to specific gain and gain compression requirements were calculated for various amplifier lengths. The resulting noise figures together with the required pump and input signal powers map out all possible solutions given constraints on gain, compression, pump power, output signal power, and noise figure. In some cases, requirements on the output signal power prohibit any solutions. A way to solve this problem is the introduction of a post-amplifier loss. For this configuration, two possible solutions exist, which collapse into one solution at a certain critical loss, under which there exist no solutions. When the impact of amplified spontaneous emission is neglected in the model, only one solution is obtained, and the critical loss is much smaller than when the amplified spontaneous emission is included in the model. We conclude that amplified spontaneous emission generally has to be taken into account, even when the gain is as low as 10 dB, to accurately predict the noise performance of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4755991","volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of noise in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers in the saturated regime","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of noise in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers in the saturated regime","sourcePdf":"00301813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039206S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","articleId":"301813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":301814,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

Because the refractive index grating is formed by the interference pattern generated where mutually coherent optical beams overlap, the receiver can automatically adjust to changes in angle of arrival or optical wavefront profiles which occur on time scales longer than the grating formation time. The grating appears stationary to high-speed phase modulation imposed on the signal beam and coherently diffracts local oscillator light into the signal beam direction. Performance measurements are reported for a prototype system that used two independent Nd:YAG lasers at 1.064 /spl mu/m, an iron-doped indium phosphide photorefractive crystal, and a four-slot phase modulation signal format. A receiver BER of 10/sup -6/ was obtained at received signal powers that corresponded to an average of 70 detected signal photons per bit at a source data rate of 50 Mb/s, 130 detected signal photons/bit at 220 Mb/s, and about 400 detected signal photons/bit at a 325 Mb/s source data rate.

The critical pulse power, at which the performance of C-OTDR is degraded by the effect of optical nonlinear phenomena in a single-mode optical fiber, depends on the amplified optical pulse waveform and the pulse width. For a pulse width of 1 /spl mu/s or longer, the incident pulse power is limited by the effect of self-phase modulation (SPM). When an optical pulse having a power gradient within the pulse width is incident to a single-mode optical fiber, the optical frequency of the backscattered signal is shifted by SPM, and the center frequency of the signal moves outside the receiver band, so the sensitivity of C-OTDR is degraded. For a pulse width of 100 ns, the incident optical pulse power is limited by four-wave mixing (FWM) which transfers the energy from the incident optical pulse to Stokes and anti-Stokes light as a result of the interaction between the incident optical pulse and amplified spontaneous emission. This paper also demonstrates the high performance of C-OTDR enhanced with EDF A's with 48, 44, 39, and 29 dB single-way dynamic ranges for pulse widths of 10 /spl mu/s, 4 /spl mu/s, 1 /spl mu/s, and 100 ns, respectively, limited by the effect of SPM or FWM.

The performance of DD and AM links is dominated by RIN above a critical value of received optical power. For a RIN level of -155 dB/Hz, the SFDR's of DD and AM links are 49 and 47 dB, respectively, for a received optical power of 10 dBm in a 1 GHz bandwidth. The SFDR's of the DD and coherent links used for transmission of subcarrier-multiplexed (SCM) signals are also derived. We evaluate target laser parameters needed by a number of different applications. For AM video and antenna remoting applications, linewidths of <1 and <3 kHz are required to use PM and FM links, respectively. For FM video, linewidths of <150 and <350 MHz are required to use PM and FM links. For SCM digital applications, linewidths of <80 and <200 MHz are required to use PM and FM links. The paper concludes with a discussion of system implementation issues, including linearization, optical frequency modulation, balanced receivers, and IF issues.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.301820","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7452/00301820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.301820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic range of coherent analog fiber-optic links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic range of coherent analog fiber-optic links","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4755998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic range of coherent analog fiber-optic links","sourcePdf":"00301820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053923S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"80","articleId":"301820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":301823,"authors":[{"name":"Wen De Zhong","affiliation":["NTT Communication Switching Laboratories, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Wen De Zhong","id":"37352076500"},{"name":"M.

It combines the advantages of photonics (a large bandwidth for transport of cells) and electronics (advanced logical functions for controlling, processing, and routing). It uses a hierarchical photonic multiplexing structure in which several tens of channels with a relatively low bit rate, say 2.4 Gb/s, are first time-multiplexed on an optical highway by shrinking the interval between optical pulses, then a number of optical highways are wavelength-multiplexed (or space-division multiplexed). As a result, the switch capacity can be expanded from the order of 100 Gb/s to the order of 10 Tb/s in a modular fashion. A new implementation scheme for cell buffering is used for eliminating the bottleneck when receiving and storing concurrent optical cells at bit rates as high as 100 Gb/s. This new architecture can serve as the basis of a modular, expandable, high-performance ATM switching system for future broad band integrated service digital networks (B-ISDN's).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahipas: a modular and expandable terabit/second hierarchically multiplexing photonic ATM switch architecture","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.301823","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7452/00301823.pdf","startPage":"1307","endPage":"1315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.301823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Terahipas: a modular and expandable terabit/second hierarchically multiplexing photonic ATM switch architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4756001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahipas: a modular and expandable terabit/second hierarchically multiplexing photonic ATM switch architecture","sourcePdf":"00301823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059561S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","articleId":"301823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":301830,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

However, the numerical properties of SLA have been largely unexplored. The authors analyze the finite word-length (FWL) performance of SLA filters under fixed-point arithmetic. To support this analysis, two new state variable descriptions (SVD) are introduced. First, a state variable based description especially suited for analysis of certain SLA structures, called the sectioned K and W description (SKWD), is defined by sectioning the noise contributions of the nonrecursive nodes. Second, a noncanonic state variable description (NCSVD) is introduced, which explicitly includes the pipelined delay variables in the state space. Roundoff noise (RON) and statistical coefficient quantization noise (SCQN) are derived under an independent pseudonoise source model, SCQN is shown to be interpretable as RON under the single length accumulation model, which enables the unification of RON and SCQN analysis. Analytic closed form solutions for first- and second-order direct form (DF) SLA filters are derived and compared to results from SLA minimum roundoff noise (MRON) structures. The SLA structures are all found to have generally good numerical properties, except that the DF SLA structure performs poorly in certain regions near the unit circle. However, the DF SLA structure actually performs better than the MRON form over much of the unit disk at a far smaller implementation cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7453/00301837.pdf","startPage":"1983","endPage":"1995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.301837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.301837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite word-length effects of pipelined recursive digital filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","IIR filters","Delay","Scattering","Pipeline processing","Throughput","Performance analysis","Fixed-point arithmetic","State-space methods","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","pipeline processing","digital arithmetic","digital arithmetic","roundoff errors","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite word-length effects","pipelined recursive digital filters","scattered look-ahead pipelining","throughput","multiplier latency","numerical properties","SLA filters","fixed-point arithmetic","state variable descriptions","sectioned K and W description","noise contributions","nonrecursive nodes","noncanonic state variable description","pipelined delay variables","state space","roundoff noise","statistical coefficient quantization noise","independent pseudonoise source model","single length accumulation model","closed form solution","SLA minimum roundoff noise structures","MRON form"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Finite word-length effects of pipelined recursive digital filters","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4763197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite word-length effects of pipelined recursive digital filters","sourcePdf":"00301837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059132S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"301837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":301838,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Zong Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academic Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pei-Zong Lee","id":"37289660500"},{"name":"Fang-Yu Huang","affiliation":["National Bureau of Standards, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fang-Yu Huang","id":"37383031400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"301838","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The prime-factor decomposition is a fast computational technique for many important digital signal processing operations, such as the convolution, the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete Hartley transform, and the discrete cosine transform (DCT).

In the paper, the authors show that all time-frequency transforms of Cohen's class may be achieved by simple changes in backprojection reconstruction filtering. The resolution/cross-term tradeoff that occurs in time-frequency kernel selection is shown to be analogous to the resolution-ringing tradeoff that occurs in computed tomography (CT). \"Ideal\" reconstruction using a purely differentiating backprojection filter yields the Wigner distribution, whereas low-pass differentiating filters produce cross-term suppressing distributions such as the spectrogram or the Born-Jordan distribution. It is also demonstrated how this analogy can be exploited to \"tune\" the reconstruction filtering (or time-frequency kernel) to improve the ringing/resolution tradeoff. Some properties of the projection domain, which is also known as the Radon-Wigner transform, are characterized, including the response to signal delays or frequency shifts and projection masking or convolution. Last, time-varying filtering by shift-varying convolution in the Radon-Wigner domain is shown to yield superior results to its analogous Cohen's class adaptive transform (shift-invariant convolution) for the multicomponent, linear-FM signals that are investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7453/00301844.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.301844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.301844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=301844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomographic time-frequency analysis and its application toward time-varying filtering and adaptive kernel design for multicomponent linear-FM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Filtering","Convolution","Kernel","Computed tomography","Low pass filters","Spectrogram","Signal resolution","Delay","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","filtering and prediction theory","time-varying systems","adaptive systems","frequency modulation","computerised tomography","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tomographic time-frequency analysis","time-varying filtering","adaptive kernel design","multicomponent linear-FM signals","line integrals","Wigner spectrum","dechirping","tomographic reconstruction problem","Cohen's class","time-frequency transforms","backprojection reconstruction filtering","resolution/cross-term tradeoff","resolution-ringing tradeoff","backprojection filter","low-pass differentiating filters","cross-term suppressing distributions","projection domain","Radon-Wigner transform","signal delays","frequency shifts","projection masking","shift-invariant convolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Tomographic time-frequency analysis and its application toward time-varying filtering and adaptive kernel design for multicomponent linear-FM signals","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4763205","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomographic time-frequency analysis and its application toward time-varying filtering and adaptive kernel design for multicomponent linear-FM signals","sourcePdf":"00301844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057963S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","articleId":"301844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":301848,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

In addition, efficient FB FFT, FB beamspace, FB EVD updating, FB SVD, and FB SVD updating methods are derived.

This means that the GLR test (GLRT) is the uniformly most powerful invariant detector.

In the paper, a bit-serial bit-level systolic array based on new schemes for multiplication and inner-product computation is presented to implement DLMS adaptive N-tap FIR filters. The architecture is highly regular, modular, and thus well-suited to VLSI implementation. It has an efficiency of 100% and a throughput rate of one filter output per 2B cycles, where B is the word length of input data. In addition, the proposed array uses a small delay of [(4B+N/2+4)/2B] in the filter coefficient adaptation, where [x] is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. This ensures that the DLMS algorithm can have good performance under proper selection of the step size. Based on a conservative design technique of static complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic, it is shown that the proposed system can be realized in a single chip for most practical applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/301851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4763212","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"8","displayDocTitle":"Bit-serial VLSI implementation of delayed LMS adaptive FIR filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-serial VLSI implementation of delayed LMS adaptive FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00301851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043014S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"301851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":301854,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors examine the reliability of RAID (redundant arrays of inexpensive disks) systems and find that although extremely reliable disk arrays cannot be attained with data redundancy alone, RAID system reliability can be made better than conventional large disks with little extra hardware. They show that the rest of the system components, such as the host bus adapters, power supplies, and fans cannot be ignored. The authors present a scheme in which the system support components are organized into groups orthogonal to the data redundancy groups, thus guaranteeing that no single disk or component failure will permanently lose data. This approach yields disk arrays with reliability about 50% greater than conventional disk subsystems. If further reliability improvements are sought, various parts of the support hardware can be made redundant.

NeWS uses this parallelism to deal with the inherent concurrency of human/computer interactions. NeWS provides multiple, lightweight processes to deal with this parallelism; as a result, user interfaces are demonstrably easier to implement using NeWS than using other window servers. The pseudoconcurrency of NeWS naturally suggests that it might be an excellent candidate for execution on a true parallel processor. The goal of the PIX (parallel interactive executive) project was to produce a version of NeWS that runs on parallel processors, and to fix some problems with NeWS. In addition, execution NeWS on a parallel processor does more than just provide execution speed advantages, it begins to redefine the role of server-based user interfaces in modern computer systems. PIX extensions of NeWS include: preemptive process scheduling; Linda operators are used for safe interprocess communication; and a decentralized event mechanism.

Here, an approach for generating, with an accuracy check, all the dominant poles within the frequency range of interest using complex frequency hopping (CFH) is presented. The method, based on a binary search strategy, uses multiport complex moment-matching in the frequency s plane. CFH allows for the efficient analysis of large networks which include lossy, coupled transmission lines and nonlinear terminations, with estimated waveforms converging to simulation accuracy.

FPGAs using 3-input lookup tables (LUTs) require many logical levels and complex interconnections. On the other hand, FPGAs using 6-input LUTs require fewer interconnections and fewer logical levels. We show a method to represent logic functions by using pseudo-Kronecker diagrams (PKDD's). Experimental results show that 2-valued PKDDs require 29% fewer nodes than BDDs, and 4-valued PKDDs require 23% fewer than QDDs, the 4-valued extension of BDDs. Thus, this method is useful for the design of FPGAs with 6-input LUTs. However, when LUTs have less than 6-inputs, this method is not applicable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 24th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic (ISMVL'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 24th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic (ISMVL'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/964/7457/00302215.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design method for look-up table type FPGA by pseudo-Kronecker expansion","doi":"10.1109/ISMVL.1994.302215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.1994.302215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=302215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/302215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A design method for look-up table type FPGA by pseudo-Kronecker expansion","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4706407","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design method for look-up table type FPGA by pseudo-Kronecker expansion","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00302215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054178S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1994","isNumber":"7457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"964","citationCount":"22","articleId":"302215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":302218,"authors":[{"name":"B.

They allow efficient manipulation algorithms for set operations, e.g. union and intersection. An application to genetic algorithms (GAs) is presented in more detail. A population is represented by a multi-rooted FG.

A new and successful method has been developed and demonstrated that enables very fast integer ambiguity estimation. The method makes use of an ambiguity reparametrization that allows one to reformulate the original ambiguity estimation problem into a new problem that becomes much easier to solve. The theoretical concepts of the method are presented, and some representative numerical results are given and discussed. In particular, it is demonstrated that a very significant reduction in both the correlation between the ambiguities and in the elongation of the corresponding confidence ellipsoid can be reached. Typically a reduction by a factor of between 10/sup 2/ and 10/sup 3/ of the square-root of the condition number of the confidence ellipsoid can be obtained. Also the gain in time, which is needed to follow through the various computational steps, is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.1994.303362","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1083/7468/00303362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.1994.303362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7468","startPage":"562","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for fast carrier phase ambiguity estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new method for fast carrier phase ambiguity estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303362/","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4731242","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for fast carrier phase ambiguity estimation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00303362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03744S","chronDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1083","citationCount":"100","articleId":"303362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303374,"authors":[{"name":"J.

More generally, it is well known that the GDOP matrix is the covariance of the linearized least squares errors in estimating position and bias from pseudoranges with unit variances. However a much stronger statistical interpretation is possible. In this paper we explore the relationship between the GDOP matrix and the Cramer-Rao bound of classical statistical point estimation. We also detail an interpretation of GDOP made in earlier work. In the first part of the paper we show that the GDOP matrix is actually the Cramer-Rao lower bound on estimates of position and bias given that the pseudorange errors are Gaussian distributed. In light of recent work indicating that pseudoranges not affected by SA are likely not Gaussian, we discuss generalization of this result to symmetric non-Gaussian pseudorange errors. In the second part of the paper, the GDOP is interpreted in terms of covariance about the average line of sight vector. This interpretation is used to compare ranging systems with pseudoranging systems. It is demonstrated that ranging systems are inherently more accurate, given the same geometry and measurement variances. Conditions under which the two systems are equivalent are derived. The role of the clock bias in this relationship is detailed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.1994.303374","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1083/7468/00303374.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.1994.303374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GDOP and the Cramer-Rao bound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303374/","displayDocTitle":"GDOP and the Cramer-Rao bound","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4731256","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GDOP and the Cramer-Rao bound","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00303374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039659S","chronDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1083","citationCount":"50","articleId":"303374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303391,"authors":[{"name":"Changdon Kee","affiliation":["HEPL Gravity Probe B, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Changdon Kee","id":"37345809400"},{"name":"B.W.

However in aircraft precision approaches, higher accuracy is required. Conventional differential GPS (DGPS) usually has accuracies of 1-3 meters within 100 kilometers of the reference station, even with selective availability (SA) errors. If DGPS is implemented on a large scale, the total number of monitor stations needed to cover the continental U.S. to the same accuracy would exceed 500. Wide area differential GPS (WADGPS) is a system that can reduce the number of monitor stations substantially while achieving the same accuracy. Test results showed a meter 3D positioning error with zero latency and 2-5 m 3D positioning error with 5-10 seconds of latency using WADGPS which has 6 monitor stations with 1632 km minimum baseline to a dual frequency user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4731274","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 1994","displayDocTitle":"Wide area differential GPS as a future navigation system in the U.S","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide area differential GPS as a future navigation system in the U.S","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00303391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03696S","chronDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1083","citationCount":"7","articleId":"303391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":303398,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

Therefore it is necessary to know the relationship between RLGs and INU errors that would give the opportunity to improve the attitude accuracy by calculating the compensation values. A strapdown INU consisting of three mutually orthogonal RLGs each measuring the angular rate along its sensitive axis is considered. Each RLG has some inherent errors and consequently the measurements are incorrect; so the problem is to conceive the 'error equation' that could relate attitude and RLG errors. Using quaternions as orientations parameters and introducing particular error quaternion, the author formed the 'errors equation' that gives the relationship between vehicle attitude errors and the incorrect value of angular velocity caused by RLGs errors. The next step is to reveal the connection between specific kind of RLG errors such as null-shift and variations and measured value. After performing this step, he designed the general 'errors equation' that allows him to compute vehicle attitude errors as a function of particular RLG errors. The 'errors equation' was designed for general case and was modified for a specific INU: RLG-azimuth that is called laser direction keeper (LDK). LDK uses the hardware mentioned above and differs from other INUs with the operation algorithm. This paper presents examples of the orientation accuracy evaluation for such technological problems as non-orthogonality of RLG axes and initial setting errors. The formulas for numerical integration of the 'error equation' along with the results of such calculations are displayed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.1994.303398","startPage":"833","endPage":"838","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1083/7468/00303398.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Position, Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS'94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.1994.303398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Errors of an inertial navigation unit caused by ring laser gyros errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inertial navigation","Ring lasers","Equations","Quaternions","Vehicles","Position measurement","Accuracy","Angular velocity","Optical design","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial navigation","measurement errors","gyroscopes","measurement by laser beam","ring lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RLG errors","ring laser gyros errors","strapdown inertial navigation unit","attitude errors","INU errors","attitude accuracy","compensation values","angular rate","error equation","orientations parameters","error quaternion","vehicle attitude errors","angular velocity","null-shift","operation algorithm","orientation accuracy evaluation","initial setting errors","numerical integration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Errors of an inertial navigation unit caused by ring laser gyros errors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 1994","accessionNumber":"4731281","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Errors of an inertial navigation unit caused by ring laser gyros errors","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00303398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025614S","chronDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1083","citationCount":"13","articleId":"303398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":303406,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The unique design of this receiver allows phase coherent measurements to be made across a broad range of frequencies, enabling optimal combination of a set of measurements from signals on different frequencies, for example GPS L1, L2, and L3, GLONASS or ground-based pseudolites. The receiver methodology provides precise absolute positioning measurements by maintaining phase coherency between frequencies of interest by direct L-band digital sampling. A one-bit sampler head is discussed that is suitable for navigation and digital communications applications. Surveillance applications can be accommodated with an expanded, multi-bit sampler. The design is particularly suited for chip set integration leading to a miniaturized and low cost receiver. Design of the receiver's digital front-end provides coherency between the code and carrier phase of the measurements across a 400 MHz bandwidth with down-conversion effected by digital techniques. In addition, it features a software configurable topology that enables filter parameters to be loaded dynamically, allowing rapid change of tracking frequency. The flexible \"software receiver\" architecture has been developed to allow the receiver to be dynamically reconfigured for different applications. This allows the receiver channels to be used for GPS navigation, ionospheric calibration, attitude determination, or even GLONASS navigation simply through software commands. Sampler performance criteria are discussed as well as test data demonstrating the effect of sampler performance on the receiver correlation loss.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4731194","conferenceDate":"11-15 April 1994","displayDocTitle":"Digital L-band receiver architecture with direct RF sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital L-band receiver architecture with direct RF sampling","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00303406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025211S","chronDate":"11-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1083","citationCount":"30","articleId":"303406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":303494,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper we report an in depth study of these properties in the AlInAs/GaInAs heterostructure material system grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We show that by judicious control of the tunnel coupling between wells and of the thickness of the latter one can design the wavefunctions and the energy levels in such a may that these new structures behave as quasi-molecules with extremely large dipole matrix elements and strongly field tunable nonlinear optical properties. Structures with giant nonlinear susceptibilities /spl chi//sup (2)/(2/spl omega/) and /spl chi//sup (3)/(3/spl omega/) (compared to the bulk constituents of the quantum wells) have been designed and demonstrated. They exhibit large linear Stark shifts of the intersubband transitions which have been used to efficiently tune the nonlinear susceptibilities. The second order nonlinear susceptibility |/spl chi//sup (2)/(2/spl omega/)| exhibits a peak as a function of the electric field corresponding to the energy levels being made equally spaced via the Stark effect. In a three-coupled-well structure triply resonant third harmonic generation has been observed. This process is associated with four equally spaced bound states. The corresponding |/spl chi//sub (3/spl omega/)//sup (3)/| (10/sup -14/ (m/V)/sup 2/ at 300 K and 4/spl times/10/sup -14/ (m/V)/sup 2/ at 30 K) is the highest measured third order noniinear susceptibility in any material. The equivalent of multiphoton ionization of a molecule has also been investigated in this structure. Electrons are photoexcited to a continuum resonance above the barrier via a three-photon transition enhanced by intermediate energy levels. The effect of this resonance on /spl chi//sup (3)/(3/spl omega/) as the electric field is varied is also investigated. Finally, appropriate figures of merit are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled quantum well semiconductors with giant electric field tunable nonlinear optical properties in the infrared","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.303697","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7473/00303697.pdf","startPage":"1313","endPage":"1326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.303697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Coupled quantum well semiconductors with giant electric field tunable nonlinear optical properties in the infrared","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4742089","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled quantum well semiconductors with giant electric field tunable nonlinear optical properties in the infrared","sourcePdf":"00303697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108877S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"151","articleId":"303697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":303710,"authors":[{"name":"M.

One is a hierarchical power-line scheme for iterative circuits. In this scheme, a group of circuits is divided into blocks; only the selected block is supplied with power, while the subthreshold current to the many nonselected blocks is reduced. This scheme minimizes the number of circuits carrying the large subthreshold current. Applications of this scheme to word drivers, decoders and sense-amplifier driving circuits are shown. The other scheme is a switched-power-supply inverter with a level holder for random combinational logic circuits. In the active mode of the chip, the operating period of the inverter is distinguished from the inactive period. The inverter is supplied with power only in the operating period, while in the inactive period the subthreshold current is shut off and the output level is kept by the flip-flop level holder. This scheme shortens the period in which the large subthreshold current flows. Both schemes are evaluated for a conceptually-designed 16-Gb DRAM. They reduce its active current by ten-fold from the conventional 1.2 A to 116 mA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Subthreshold current","Inverters","Threshold voltage","Switching circuits","Power supplies","Driver circuits","Maintenance","MOSFETs","Logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","driver circuits","invertors","combinatorial circuits","flip-flops","switched mode power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subthreshold-current reduction circuit","multigigabit DRAM","hierarchical power-line scheme","iterative circuits","word drivers","decoders","sense-amplifier driving circuits","switched-power-supply inverter","multi-gigabit DRAMs","random combinational logic circuits","flip-flop level holder","active current reduction","dynamic RAM","16 Gbit","116 mA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303713","doi":"10.1109/4.303713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7474/00303713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.303713","startPage":"761","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subthreshold-current reduction circuits for multi-gigabit DRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subthreshold-current reduction circuits for multi-gigabit DRAM's","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","volume":"29","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747116","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subthreshold-current reduction circuits for multi-gigabit DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00303713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077554S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","articleId":"303713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303715,"authors":[{"name":"Jyh-Ming Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Ming Wang","id":"37068381500"},{"name":"Sung-Chuan Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sung-Chuan Fang","id":"37382308900"},{"name":"Wu-Shiung Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wu-Shiung Feng","id":"37280036300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"303715","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":201,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":3260},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303715","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS devices","MOSFETs","Switches","Threshold voltage","Circuit simulation","CMOS logic circuits","Sun","Workstations","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic gates","logic design","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated logic circuits","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XOR function","XNOR function","transistor level","exclusive-OR","exclusive-NOR","noncomplementary signal inputs","HSPICE simulation"]}],"abstract":"Two new methods are proposed to implement the exclusive-OR and exclusive-NOR functions on the transistor level.

At first, basic pass-transistor switches fabricated in a 0.5-/spl mu/m GaAs HEMT technology are measured for characterization of transient errors induced due to clock-feedthrough and charge transfer. In order to improve the switch dynamic performances, a dual dummy transistor compensation technique is used and related driver circuitry is developed. On-wafer measurements demonstrate that the improved switch provides a significant reduction of the transient errors, a reasonable dynamic range, and a high isolation. The switch with a 0.53 pF load capacitor achieves a total harmonic distortion below -55 dB and -38 dB at 10 MHz and 1.0 GHz clock frequency, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.303725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7474/00303725.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"850","doi":"10.1109/4.303725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and improvement of GaAs HEMT analog switches for sampled-data applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and improvement of GaAs HEMT analog switches for sampled-data applications","volume":"29","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and improvement of GaAs HEMT analog switches for sampled-data applications","sourcePdf":"00303725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031847S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"303725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":303736,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

These sequences can be classified as the modulatable orthogonal sequences, because they can be modulated by a string of arbitrary complex numbers of unit magnitude, retaining the ideal periodic autocorrelation function and optimum crosscorrelation function. For the applications in spread-spectrum system, where the sequence length can be significantly large, it is highly important to minimize the complexity of the corresponding matched filter. The new efficient implementation of the matched filter is based on the algebraic decomposition of GCL sequences. Some interesting special cases of the efficient pulse compressors, proposed previously for P3 and P4 codes are obtained. The subclass of GCL sequences which permits even more efficient matched filter implementation for any length N=sm/sup 2/ is derived. It is shown that such a subclass of the GCL sequences comprises the so-called generalized Frank sequences, which can be obtained as a special case of the GCL sequences of length N=m/sup 2/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.303746","startPage":"769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/7475/00303746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.303746","endPage":"777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient matched filter for the generalized chirp-like polyphase sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Efficient matched filter for the generalized chirp-like polyphase sequences","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4741999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient matched filter for the generalized chirp-like polyphase sequences","sourcePdf":"00303746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024357S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"18","articleId":"303746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303748,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The case where the offboard tracker continues to update its local track estimate with measurement and system dynamics models that are not necessarily linear is considered. An algorithm is developed to perform this fusion at a central node without having access to the offboard measurements, their noise statistics, or the location of the local estimator. The algorithm is based on an extension of results that were originally established for linear offboard trackers. A second goal of this work is to develop an inequality constraint for selecting the proper sampling interval for the incoming state estimates to the fusion node. This interval is selected to allow use of conventional Kalman filter algorithms at the fusion node without suffering error performance degradation due to processing a correlated sequence of track state estimates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.303748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/7475/00303748.pdf","startPage":"787","endPage":"799","doi":"10.1109/7.303748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data fusion of decentralized local tracker outputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Data fusion of decentralized local tracker outputs","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4742001","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data fusion of decentralized local tracker outputs","sourcePdf":"00303748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033589S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"27","articleId":"303748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":303752,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

The significant advantages of P(n,k) codes over conventional polyphase codes are lower autocorrelation sidelobes and an improved tolerance of low Doppler shifts and precompression bandwidth limitations. The primary disadvantage of the P(n,k) codes over conventional codes is a loss in range resolution.

The first one is the Intelligent Vehicle, developed since the mid 1970's, which has a machine vision system for obstacle detection and a dead reckoning system for autonomous navigation on a compact car. The machine vision system with stereo TV cameras is featured by real time processing using hard-wired logic. The dead reckoning function and a new lateral control algorithm enable the vehicle to drive from a starting point to a goal. It drove autonomously at about 10 km/h while avoiding an obstacle. The second one is the Personal Vehicle System (PVS), developed in the late 1980's, which is a comprehensive test system for a vision-based vehicle. The machine vision system captures lane markings at both road edges along which the vehicle is guided. The PVS has another machine vision system for obstacle detection with stereo cameras. The PVS drove at 10-30 km/h along lanes with turnings and crossings. The third one is the Automated Highway Vehicle System (AHVS) with a single TV camera for lane-keeping by PD control. The machine vision system uses an edge extraction algorithm to detect lane markings. The AHVS drove at 50 km/h along a lane with a large curvature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.303790","startPage":"398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7476/00303790.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.303790","endPage":"405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-based vehicles in Japan: machine vision systems and driving control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Vision-based vehicles in Japan: machine vision systems and driving control systems","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4760736","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-based vehicles in Japan: machine vision systems and driving control systems","sourcePdf":"00303790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029381S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"80","articleId":"303790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303792,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

Resonant inverters may be utilized in electronic ballasts because of their load-dependent characteristics. The three basic types of resonant inverters, the series-loaded, parallel-loaded, and the series-parallel-loaded, are compared using fundamental approximation techniques for their applicability in electronic ballasts operating from a low voltage source. A parallel-loaded resonant inverter operating slightly above its resonant frequency is selected because of the high voltage gains possible. Operation above the resonant frequency allows zero-voltage turn on of the semiconductor devices. Zero-voltage turn off can be achieved with the addition of lossless snubber capacitors.

The paper considers variable frequency variable voltage operation of a three-phase induction motor in single-phase mode for two common faults of a three-phase inverter, i.e., open base drive and device short-circuit. The motor performance has been extensively analyzed in single-phase mode and remedial strategies have been developed to neutralize large second and other lower order harmonic pulsating torques. In a single-phase open loop volts/Hz control made of a faulty three-phase inverter, it has been demonstrated that odd harmonic voltages at appropriate phase angles can be injected to neutralize the low frequency pulsating torques so as to permit smooth drive operation. It has been shown that the pulsating torque can be further reduced by load dependent flux programming rather than operating with constant rated flux.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7476/00303793.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.303793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.303793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=303793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault mode single-phase operation of a variable frequency induction motor drive and improvement of pulsating torque characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Power system reliability","Inverters","Fault tolerant systems","Voltage","Induction motors","Harmonic analysis","Performance analysis","Torque control","Open loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","electric drives","electrical faults","power convertors","invertors","harmonics","velocity control","machine control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","power converter systems","variable frequency induction motor drive","fault mode single-phase operation","three-phase","open base drive","device short-circuit","performance","single-phase","harmonic pulsating torques","phase angles","load dependent flux programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fault mode single-phase operation of a variable frequency induction motor drive and improvement of pulsating torque characteristics","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4755668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault mode single-phase operation of a variable frequency induction motor drive and improvement of pulsating torque characteristics","sourcePdf":"00303793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027683S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","articleId":"303793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":303796,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A cascade control structure is used to ensure maximum flexibility. The controller for a DC motor is considered in great detail. Extension to AC synchronous PM motors is also presented. At the different control levels robustness is addressed with specific algorithms and the simplest solution is always selected. The controller architecture for both DC and AC synchronous motor are presented and discussed in the paper.

SRMs are used in AdeptOne robots, and the authors perform experiments with two robots, controlled in coordination, in grasping and manipulation of various objects. The object and robot parameters are not exactly known, and adaptive methods are used to control the overall system. These methods are model-based control techniques which require high bandwidth torque control. This requirement is typical for high precision mechanisms. SRM characteristics are very nonlinear. In particular the torque ripple, friction, and the torque versus position and current relationships were analyzed in the context mentioned above, and specifically, for force control applications. The proposed method is based on a new commutation algorithm and a measured torque versus position and current relationship, used to smooth the SRM's torque ripple, hence generating a torque output nearly independent of position. Furthermore, the internal friction is estimated on-line, and compensated for. This renders a high accuracy torque tracking. The torque control method is based on feedback from the motor angular velocity, motor angle, armature current, and feedforward for friction compensation and cancellation of nonlinear effects. The method has been tested experimentally on Adept motors and the results were very encouraging. The method has been also used for adaptive control of two coordinated Adept robots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.303797","startPage":"461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7476/00303797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.303797","endPage":"466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of switched reluctance motor torque for force control applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/303797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Control of switched reluctance motor torque for force control applications","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4755672","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of switched reluctance motor torque for force control applications","sourcePdf":"00303797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050677S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"25","articleId":"303797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":303847,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

These segmentation problems can be formulated as configurational optimization problems by representing the configurations of interest in an image as unique subsets of the complete image. An effective segmentation optimization algorithm must determine the specific image subset that best exhibits an a priori set of quantitative characteristics. Here, a genetic optimization algorithm was used to produce a population of individual sub-images that were tested via a quantitative objective function, ranked using a linear fitness and decrement scheme, and modified using a genetic cross-over operator. The algorithm was found to converge within 25 to 50 generations to a good fit to the targeted configuration in a robust and efficient manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NEBC.1994.305171","startPage":"76","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 20th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1130/7485/00305171.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 20th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEBC.1994.305171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of genetic optimization to medical image segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Encoding","Biological cells","Image edge detection","Genetic mutations","Testing","Image converters","Robustness","Image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image segmentation","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic optimization","medical image segmentation","configurational optimization problems","image subsets","a priori set","quantitative characteristics","quantitative objective function","genetic cross-over operator","linear fitness/decrement scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic optimization to medical image segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-18 March 1994","accessionNumber":"4715614","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic optimization to medical image segmentation","confLoc":"Springfield, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00305171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040821S","chronDate":"17-18 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1130","citationCount":"1","articleId":"305171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":305453,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The first model was introduced by Rusck (1957) and the second model by Agrawal, Price, and Gurbaxani (1980). In the nomenclature adopted in this paper, the first model is referred to as the \"Rusck model\" and the second as the \"Wave Antenna Model.\" The transmission line equations of the Rusck model can be written in such away that the forcing term in the equations is the horizontal electric field. The results show that the Rusck model is incomplete. It takes into account the portion of the horizontal electric field generated by the gradient of the scalar potential but neglects the contribution from the vector potential. This defect in the Rusck model makes it source-dependent. That is, the Rusck model can give accurate results only when the spatial location of the source that generates the electromagnetic field is such that the contribution of the vector potential to the horizontal field is either zero or can be neglected. Under such circumstances the Rusck model and the Wave Antenna Model are described by the same transmission line equations, and the results predicted by the two models are identical.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculating lightning-induced overvoltages in power lines.

The major feature in this study is to combine the finite element analysis with a lumped parameter model to provide desirable engineering information but at minimum computational effort. To this end, two co-ordinated stages are involved. One is to develop a unified lumped parameter model applicable for both the steady-state and dynamic analysis. The other stage is to extract individual lumped parameters from the finite element solutions. Based on the derived finite element formulae suitable for both the current source and voltage source supplies, the nonlinearity and skin effects are appropriately taken into account.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7908433/00305531.pdf","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.305531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.305531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7908433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=305531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field circuit analysis of permanent magnet synchronous motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit analysis","Permanent magnet motors","Finite element methods","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Information analysis","Magnetic analysis","Steady-state","Data mining","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","starting","magnetic circuits","finite element analysis","lumped parameter networks","equivalent circuits","machine theory","eddy currents","skin effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet synchronous motors","field circuit analysis","simulation","starting","synchronous performance","finite element analysis","lumped parameter model","unified lumped parameter model","steady-state","dynamic analysis","individual lumped parameters","voltage source supply","current source supply","nonlinearity","skin effects","equivalent circuits","eddy currents"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Field circuit analysis of permanent magnet synchronous motors","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761670","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field circuit analysis of permanent magnet synchronous motors","sourcePdf":"00305531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093607S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7908433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"43","articleId":"305531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":305545,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Inform. Theory, vol.39, p.145-56, Jan. 1993) for determining the upper bound to the probability of error of a decision feedback equalizer is applied to the magnetic recording channel (MRC). The upper bound on the probability of a symbol error is calculated as a function of the channel information density for both binary and ternary decision feedback equalization of the MRC. The MRC is modeled as a linear channel with a Lorentzian step response, additive white Gaussian noise, and perfect timing. A comparison of the binary and ternary MRC under these assumptions shows that in the absence of channel coding, the binary MRC is preferred for information densities of interest. However, the ternary MRC may have an advantage when channel coding is used at high information densities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.305545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.305545","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7908433/00305545.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7908433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upper bounds for binary and ternary decision feedback equalization of the magnetic recording channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Upper bounds for binary and ternary decision feedback equalization of the magnetic recording channel","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761684","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305545/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper bounds for binary and ternary decision feedback equalization of the magnetic recording channel","sourcePdf":"00305545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038033S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7908433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","articleId":"305545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":305547,"authors":[{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Inkyu Lee","id":"37069084900"},{"name":"T.

The theories are concerned with the evaluation of prediction efficiency improved by overlapped motion compensation and also its smoothing effect on the discontinuities at block boundaries encountered when motion vectors do not coincide among neighboring blocks. They contribute to determine the optimum window shape for overlapped motion compensation in a developed wavelet codec, which suffers from reduction of coding efficiency when there are such discontinuities in a signal to be transformed. Regarding the wavelet codec, a new scanning method of transform coefficients and alternate use of normal and spatially-reversed basis functions for the cascaded wavelet transform are introduced.

The reason is that the motion model, or spatial transformation, assumed in block matching cannot approximate the motion in the real world precisely with a small number of parameters (i.e. motion vectors). To develop an effective motion compensation method for very low bit-rate video coding, The authors address the issues of 1) adopting more sophisticated spatial transformations than block matching, and 2) developing a motion estimation algorithm that is suitable for these spatial transformations. The spatial transformations discussed are affine transformation, bilinear transformation and perspective transformation. Two new motion estimation algorithms, a matching-based algorithm and its fast version, are presented. The performance of the motion compensation methods, which combine the spatial transformations and the proposed motion estimation algorithms, is evaluated theoretically and experimentally using the following criteria: prediction error, amount of motion information, and computational cost. The simulation results show that in the proposed method, the amount of motion information required to achieve a fixed level of prediction error is reduced to one fourth that of block matching. The authors combine the designed motion compensation method with the discrete cosine transform to simulate coding of CIF format images at the transmission rate of 16 kb/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation based on spatial transformations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.305878","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/7495/00305878.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.305878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=305878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation based on spatial transformations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4757751","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation based on spatial transformations","sourcePdf":"00305878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046889S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"193","articleId":"305878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":305911,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

They illustrate this point using an algorithm within the p/spl times/64 standard.

Due to the advantages of digital communications, and the trend towards it, it is desirable to develop a cost effective digital codec for HDTV signals. One of the criteria in the transmission of digital signals via satellites is the transmission bandwidth which dictates the transmission costs. Apart from development of good compression schemes, due consideration should also be given to the ease of hardware implementation, which is crucial in deciding factors like processing delay and the level of encoder/decoder complexity. With the above mentioned factors in mind a cost-effective HDTV codec is proposed. Few US organizations have addressed the problem of HDTV distribution via communication satellites. The majority of efforts in the development of an HDTV codec have been aimed at the 100 to 140 Mbits/sec data rate. To facilitate cost effective satellite transmission, the DS3 rate of 45 Mbits/sec, is desirable. The purpose of the present research is to compress the HDTV signals to around 20 Mbits/sec so that 2 HDTV channels can be transmitted through the DS3 rate channel. To achieve this degree of compression a new scheme is proposed. First subband coding is used to decompose the image into different frequency bands. Next motion compensation is applied to the low band, and the resulting interframe difference is discrete cosine transform (DCT) coded. The high bands are also DCT coded. The DCT coefficients of the difference signal of the low band and the DCT coefficients of the high band are then vector quantized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305927/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4711199","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compression of HDTV signals for low bit-rate transmission using motion compensated subband transform coding and a self-organization neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of HDTV signals for low bit-rate transmission using motion compensated subband transform coding and a self-organization neural network","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00305927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042547S","chronDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"961","articleId":"305927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":305933,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The new architecture employs loop unrolling and speculative execution of the inner loop of the algorithm to achieve a significant speed-up relative to the Q-coder architecture. This approach reduces the number of iterations required to compress a block of data by a factor that is on the order of the compression ratio. While the speed-up technique has been previously discovered independently by researchers at IBM, no systematic study of the architectural trade-offs has ever been published. For the CCITT facsimile documents, the new architecture achieves a speed-up of approximately seven compared to the IBM Q-coder when four lookahead units are employed in parallel.

Thus the authors restrict themselves to fixed rate source coding schemes, that do not have the problems of re-synchronization or complete loss of information in the case of uncorrectable transmission errors. In the paper, a high performance source coding scheme based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with an additional DCT for the low frequency sub-image and a product pyramid vector quantizer (PPVQ) utilizing trellis coded quantization (TCQ) is proposed which gives close to optimum results compared to variable length coding (VLC). This together with the ability to calculate the bit-sensitivity of the compressed image data enables one to perform a highly efficient unequal error protection for image transmission over noisy channels. Simulation results show a source coding degradation of only 0.5-0.7 dB in PSNR due to fixed rate coding compared to the best found VLC scheme. In addition, applying combined source anti-channel coding and looking at the performance after transmission over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the proposed scheme outperforms all other known fixed rate schemes, even a sophisticated VLC scheme based also on the DWT and especially has gains of up to 5 dB in PSNR and up to 3.5 dB in E/sub SN/sub 0/ compared to JPEG.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance fixed rate compression scheme for still image transmission","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC'94)","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1994.305937","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/961/7497/00305937.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"303","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00305937.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1994.305937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=305937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"A high performance fixed rate compression scheme for still image transmission","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4711209","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high performance fixed rate compression scheme for still image transmission","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00305937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07685S","chronDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"961","citationCount":"13","articleId":"305937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":305938,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

This random vector is the quantization noise associated with dithered lattice quantization, and at high resolution it is the noise generated in regular lattice quantization of \"smooth\" sources. The authors find that the noise associated with the optimal lattice quantizers is wide-sense stationary and white. Any desirable noise spectra may be realized by an appropriate linear transformation (\"shaping\") of a lattice quantizer. As the dimension increases, the normalized second moment of the optimal lattice quantizer goes to 1/2/spl pi/e, and consequently the quantization noise approaches a white Gaussian process. Actually, in entropy coded dithered quantization where the quantization procedure can be modeled as an additive noise channel, this limit behavior implies that both the asymptotic MSE distortion and the mutual-information between input and output of the quantization channel, approaches the MSE and the mutual-information between input and output of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1994.305946","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/961/7497/00305946.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"389","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00305946.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1994.305946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On lattice quantization noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=305946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/305946/","displayDocTitle":"On lattice quantization noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4711218","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On lattice quantization noise","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00305946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057159S","chronDate":"29-31 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"961","citationCount":"6","articleId":"305946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":307299,"authors":[{"name":"Harame","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Self-consistent beam optics simulations, performed via the combined use of MAGIC and POISSON, confirm the capability of the DCG to operate as a flexible and high-quality beam forming system for both large- and small-orbit devices as well as linear beam devices. In addition, the DCG configuration provides for the independent control of the velocity ratio ( alpha ), guiding center radius (r/sub g/), and velocity spread. Most importantly, this flexibility has been achieved via proper adjustments of the magnetic field profile using the same gun mechanical design. This makes the gun quite flexible, forgiving, and suitable to a very wide range of gyro-devices and linear beam devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307346","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307346.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"222","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The double-cusp gyro-gun","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","displayDocTitle":"The double-cusp gyro-gun","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4730558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307346/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The double-cusp gyro-gun","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04317S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"9","articleId":"307346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":307355,"authors":[{"name":"Watanabe","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37287342900"},{"name":"Tatsumi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Tatsumi","id":"37355037800"},{"name":"Ohnishi","affiliation":["Microelectron.

The memory cell circuit exhibits bistability, based on the RTD's negative differential resistance (NDR), at supply voltages from 0.6 to 1.1 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307404","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307404.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlAs resonant tunneling diode and HEMT for single-transistor cell SRAM application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307404/","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlAs resonant tunneling diode and HEMT for single-transistor cell SRAM application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4730615","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlAs resonant tunneling diode and HEMT for single-transistor cell SRAM application","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040351S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"6","articleId":"307404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":307410,"authors":[{"name":"Sherman","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Sherman","id":"37356421300"},{"name":"Tsang","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Tsang","id":"37341562800"},{"name":"Core","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Core","id":"37353790900"},{"name":"Payne","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Payne","id":"37342350800"},{"name":"Quinn","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Quinn","id":"37390200800"},{"name":"Chau","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Chau","id":"37381698400"},{"name":"Farash","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Farash","id":"37658554000"},{"name":"Baum","affiliation":["Analog Devices Inc.orporated, Wilmington, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Baum","id":"37660831400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307410","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration measurement","BIMOS integrated circuits","Integrated circuit fabrication","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","BIMOS integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit technology","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithic accelerometer","surface micromachined polysilicon sensor","BiMOS interface circuitry","wafer fabrication","Si"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low cost monolithic accelerometer; product/technology update","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307410","startPage":"501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307410","abstract":"Described is a complete monolithic accelerometer, which combines a surface micromachined polysilicon sensor with BiMOS interface circuitry.

Among various erase methods, the High voltage Source with grounded Erase (HSE) method is the most stable scheme for the control of erasing speed and erased threshold voltage distribution. The stability of HSE is caused by the reduced electric field fluctuations associated with cell parameter variations, due to the source bias effect, especially at the final stage of erasing. It is also found that the recently proposed self-convergence scheme is an effective tool for suppressing the erased-V/sub t/ distribution width, and that negative gate erase designs equipped with this method will be a powerful vehicle for the next generation scaled flash devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307431.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of current flash EEPROM erasing methods: stability and how to control","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of current flash EEPROM erasing methods: stability and how to control","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4730642","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of current flash EEPROM erasing methods: stability and how to control","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035412S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"34","articleId":"307431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":307432,"authors":[{"name":"Onoda","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Onoda","id":"37321012600"},{"name":"Kunori","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kunori","id":"37373101400"},{"name":"Kobayashi","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37365832600"},{"name":"Ohi","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Ohi","id":"37373102600"},{"name":"Fukumoto","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Fukumoto","id":"37322291100"},{"name":"Ajika","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Ajika","id":"37352019100"},{"name":"Miyoshi","affiliation":["LSI Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Miyoshi","id":"37327567600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307432","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":45,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","EPROM","Semiconductor memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","EPROM","integrated memory circuits","PLD programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash cell structure","3 volt operation","sector erase flash memory","DINOR","divided bit-line NOR","stacked gate cells","gate-biased FN erase/write operation","low power dissipation","high data transfer rate","fast random access","single-cell endurance characteristics","self-align processes","CMOS process","0.5 micron","3 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307432.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel cell structure suitable for a 3 volt operation, sector erase flash memory","abstract":"A novel flash cell structure named DINOR (DIvided bit-line NOR) whose bit-line is divided into main and sub bit-line, having a unit consisting of one select transistor and 8 stacked gate cells, is proposed.

Moreover, using several self-align processes, 2.88 mu m/sup 2/ cell size based on 0.5 mu m CMOS process is realized, which is a 20% cell area reduction compared with the conventional NOR cell.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4730643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel cell structure suitable for a 3 volt operation, sector erase flash memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel cell structure suitable for a 3 volt operation, sector erase flash memory","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026713S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"25","articleId":"307432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":307433,"authors":[{"name":"Endoh","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Endoh","id":"37319060700"},{"name":"Iizuka","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Iizuka","id":"37446668600"},{"name":"Aritome","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Aritome","id":"37352316400"},{"name":"Shirota","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Shirota","id":"37337744100"},{"name":"Masuoka","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Masuoka","id":"37322625100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307433","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":182},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New write/erase operation technology for flash EEPROM cells to improve the read disturb characteristics","abstract":"This paper describes the new write/erase operation methods in order to improve the read disturb characteristics for flash EEPROM cells which are written by channel hot electron injection and erased by F-N tunneling emission from the floating gate to the substrate.

The new 2-step erasing scheme consists of two steps of the cell gate bias conditions, that is to apply 1) negative high voltage on the control gate to erase the cell data, and successive 2) positive high voltage to inject a few electrons from the substrate back to the floating gate. The suppressing effect of the erased-V distribution was also confirmed using a 16 Kbit flash memory cell array, the erased-V/sub /distribution drastically decreases from 2.0 V by the conventional erasing scheme to 0.9 V using the 2-step erasing scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4730645","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel erasing technology for 3.3 V flash memory with 64 Mb capacity and beyond","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel erasing technology for 3.3 V flash memory with 64 Mb capacity and beyond","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021271S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"16","articleId":"307434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":307435,"authors":[{"name":"Chiang","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chiang","id":"37383670000"},{"name":"Forouhi","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Forouhi","id":"37658233400"},{"name":"Chen","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chen","id":"37655541800"},{"name":"Hawley","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hawley","id":"37403639500"},{"name":"McCollum","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"McCollum","id":"37283271600"},{"name":"Hamdy","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hamdy","id":"37329532900"},{"name":"Hu","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hu","id":"37280568000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307435","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":48,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit reliability","Electric breakdown","Fuses","Leakage currents","Logic arrays","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","electric breakdown of solids","electric fuses","leakage currents","logic arrays","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antifuse structures","field programmable gate arrays","programming element","reliability","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Antifuse structure as a programming element has become increasingly popular in field programmable gate array devices.

The impact ionization rate alpha rapidly increases for gate lengths shorter than 0.2 mu m in both n- and p-channel devices at the same 1/(V/sub d/-V/sub dsat/). These results are considered to be due to the increase in the carrier energy in the pinch-off region caused by the increase of the channel electric field. Moreover, for shorter than 1 mu m gate length devices, the impact ionization rate does not increase, in spite of reducing the pinch-off region length by thinning the gate oxide. As a result, the usual lucky electron model, that is the universal relationship between ln( alpha ) and 1/(V/sub d/-V/sub dsat/) should be corrected in 0.1 mu m MOSFETs, by considering the enhanced carrier temperature. Moreover, we discuss device degradation caused by D.C. stress.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hot carriers","Impact ionization","Insulated gate FETs","Semiconductor device modeling","Semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hot carriers","impact ionisation","insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS devices","hot-carrier effects","impact ionization rate","n-channel devices","p-channel devices","carrier energy","pinch-off region","channel electric field","lucky electron model","enhanced carrier temperature","device degradation","DC stress","0.1 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307454","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307454.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot-carrier effects in 0.1 mu m gate length CMOS devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hot-carrier effects in 0.1 mu m gate length CMOS devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307454/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4735601","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot-carrier effects in 0.1 mu m gate length CMOS devices","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05272S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"25","articleId":"307454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":307468,"authors":[{"name":"Browning","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Browning","id":"37087350116"},{"name":"Chung Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Chung Chan","id":"37087165947"},{"name":"Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Ye","id":"37087350019"},{"name":"MacGregor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"MacGregor","id":"37087349462"},{"name":"Ruden","affiliation":["Raytheon Company, Tewkesbury, MA, UK"],"lastName":"Ruden","id":"37087349387"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307468","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Electron tubes","Microwave tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrodes","electron tubes","microwave tubes","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-hat effects","crossed-field amplifier","linear format","low power","variable bias","electrostatic confining electrodes","current measurements","electron beam current","VHF","10 to 100 W","150 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307468","abstract":"A linear format, low frequency (150 MHz), low power (10 to 100 W), crossed-field amplifier is operated with variable bias, electrostatic confining electrodes (end-hats).

Soft-errors were induced by the proton incidence within about 6 mu m around the memory cell, in particular easily induced within 4 mu m. Such regions in which soft-errors is induced by the proton incidence were found not to depend on the spot size of proton microprobes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1992.307479","publicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1032/7499/00307479.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1992.307479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-error evaluation using proton microprobe for DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Soft-error evaluation using proton microprobe for DRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4735629","publicationDate":"1992","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-error evaluation using proton microprobe for DRAMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041019S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 1992","isNumber":"7499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1032","citationCount":"4","articleId":"307479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":307480,"authors":[{"name":"Nishihara","affiliation":["ULSI Research & Development Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Nishihara","id":"37338898100"},{"name":"Ikeda","affiliation":["ULSI Research & Development Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37433555900"},{"name":"Aozasa","affiliation":["ULSI Research & Development Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Aozasa","id":"37370907600"},{"name":"Miyazawa","affiliation":["ULSI Research & Development Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Miyazawa","id":"37379323800"},{"name":"Ochiai","affiliation":["ULSI Research & Development Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37663456200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0817-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"307480","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307480","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular logic arrays","DRAM chips","MOS integrated circuits","Semiconductor-insulator interfaces","Very-large-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","DRAM chips","MOS integrated circuits","semiconductor-insulator boundaries","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buried capacitor DRAM cell","bonded SOI","DRAMs","cell structure","cell size","PMOS cell transistor","cell plate","cell leakage current","data retention","256 Mbit","1 Gbit"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a novel DRAM cell structure using bonded SOI.

Appropriate dielectric structures to minimize such degradation have been proposed for nonvolatile memory devices with double-metal structure and scaled narrow first metal gaps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1078/7501/00307812.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1994.307812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1994.307812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=307812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of intermetal dielectric layer and high temperature bake test on the reliability of nonvolatile memory devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasma temperature","Nonvolatile memory","Degradation","Circuit testing","Dielectric losses","Dielectric devices","MOSFETs","Hot carriers","CMOS technology","Semiconductor device reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated memory circuits","EPROM","integrated circuit testing","circuit reliability","hot carriers","moisture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermetal dielectric layer","high temperature bake test","reliability","nonvolatile memory devices","water-related species","cell charge loss","hot-carrier lifetime degradation","peripheral N-channel MOSFETs","dielectric structures","double-metal structure","scaled narrow first metal gaps"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/307812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 April 1994","displayDocTitle":"The impact of intermetal dielectric layer and high temperature bake test on the reliability of nonvolatile memory devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4720870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of intermetal dielectric layer and high temperature bake test on the reliability of nonvolatile memory devices","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00307812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065672S","chronDate":"11-14 April 1994","isNumber":"7501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1078","citationCount":"8","articleId":"307812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":307815,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Wafer processors have steadily reduced sodium content to increasingly low levels in the gate oxide area. However, levels as high as 5E18 cm/sup -3/ are still commonly detected around metal layers in the industry. The industry has until now relied on the BPSG layer to prevent penetration into the active gate area. This approach is usually effective, but not bulletproof. Pinholes or thin spots in BPSG film still allow sodium ions to seep through. This protective or inter-dielectric layer. As part of a strong commitment to achieve built-in reliability, Siliconix launched a project to totally eliminate sodium from its products. As reported in this paper.

This direct measurement of T/sub V/ is preferred to its conventional estimation based on the current-voltage relationship, because of the implicit inclusion of nonlinearities and stress-induced leakage-reduction effects. Undoped and lanthanum-doped lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) films have also been characterized for frequency-dispersion in large-signal polarization, bit \"0\" relaxation and a new bit \"1\" relaxation mechanism using techniques developed recently.

A depth estimation algorithm interpolates a small number of focus measure values to obtain accurate depth estimates. A fully automated shape from focus system has been implemented using an optical microscope and tested on a variety of industrial samples.

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models, are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and for making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough in characterizing printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice \"elastic matching\" property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database that contains about 26000 words. Currently, the authors achieve a recognition accuracy of 99% when words in testing and training sets are of the same font size, and 96% when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM achieves only a 70% accuracy rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keyword spotting in poorly printed documents using pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.308482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7509/00308482.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"848","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00308482.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.308482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Keyword spotting in poorly printed documents using pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761923","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keyword spotting in poorly printed documents using pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00308482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040345S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"150","articleId":"308482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":308484,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

Validity criteria based on total fuzzy area and fuzzy density are used to estimate the optimal number of substructures in the data set.

In the case of narrowband signals we propose a fast and simple method to estimate small time delays. This method is shown to have the same or better accuracy as the cross correlation methods for small delays in the order of fractions of the sample interval. It is based on using the Hilbert transform in correlation between two signals and consists of only one scalar product, which makes it fast. It may also be used in applications with narrowband signals where the measurements are repeatable, such as ultrasonic imaging and nondestructive testing. In ultrasonic applications, due to fluctuations in the insonified media, a small random time shift may be present causing the signals to be misaligned in time. Averaging signals under these conditions will result in a distortion of the signal shape. We propose an averaging method to avoid this and to accomplish a higher SNR without the distortion. Simulations and experiments from ultrasonic applications are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Delay effects","Narrowband","Acoustic applications","Correlation","Distortion measurement","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Ultrasonic imaging","Nondestructive testing","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","delays","acoustic imaging","ultrasonic materials testing","echo","transforms","ultrasonic applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsample time delay differences","narrowband ultrasonic echoes","Hilbert transform correlation","time delay of arrival","narrowband signals","small time delays","cross correlation methods","sample interval","scalar product","ultrasonic imaging","nondestructive testing","ultrasonic applications","fluctuations","insonified media","small random time shift","averaging signals","higher SNR"]}],"doi":"10.1109/58.308493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308493.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of subsample time delay differences in narrowband ultrasonic echoes using the Hilbert transform correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of subsample time delay differences in narrowband ultrasonic echoes using the Hilbert transform correlation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308493/","volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4775527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of subsample time delay differences in narrowband ultrasonic echoes using the Hilbert transform correlation","sourcePdf":"00308493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03568S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"74","articleId":"308493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":308495,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The model describes the relation between a general time-variable velocity field and the signal correlation in space and time, including the effect of movement of the ultrasonic beam for color flow imaging systems with mechanical scanning. In the case of a constant and rectilinear velocity field, a parametric model for the autocorrelation function is deduced. General formulas for a full second order characterization of the set of autocorrelation estimates, with arbitrary lags in the spatial and temporal directions, are developed. The formulas are applied to the parametric model, and numerical results for the estimator variance are presented. A qualitative evaluation of the theoretical results has been performed by offline-processing of 2-D Doppler signals from a color flow imaging scanner. The benefit of spatial and temporal averaging is demonstrated by using different averaging filters to the same set of recorded data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","startPage":"604","endPage":"612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autocorrelation techniques in color flow imaging: signal model and statistical properties of the autocorrelation estimates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autocorrelation techniques in color flow imaging: signal model and statistical properties of the autocorrelation estimates","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775529","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autocorrelation techniques in color flow imaging: signal model and statistical properties of the autocorrelation estimates","sourcePdf":"00308495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059013S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"55","articleId":"308495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":308497,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This technique is applied to the envelope of signals received by a 2-D array. The performances of the technique are compared with those of the coherent technique of focused beamforming in terms of angular resolution, depth of field, beam pattern, and accuracy in range determination. Moreover, special attention is given to the modalities for an efficient implementation on a digital computer. The complete absence of grating lobes, for whatever arrangement of the transducers, and the much higher speed of the imaging process, as compared with that of beamforming in the time domain, are the two major advantages of this technique. A reduction in the speckle effect, the possibility of creating a virtual depth of field, the feasibility of using square-law transducers, and the implementation simplicity are additional interesting characteristics. The results of some simulations are reported and compared with those obtained by the beamforming process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308497","startPage":"621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308497","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noncoherent correlation technique and focused beamforming for ultrasonic underwater imaging: a comparative analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A noncoherent correlation technique and focused beamforming for ultrasonic underwater imaging: a comparative analysis","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4775531","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noncoherent correlation technique and focused beamforming for ultrasonic underwater imaging: a comparative analysis","sourcePdf":"00308497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050929S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"25","articleId":"308497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":308498,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

A subset of these techniques are evaluated through simulations which utilize 2-D phase aberration profiles measured in the breast. The techniques are compared based on their ability to reduce phase errors, stability, and sensitivity to noise and missing elements in the transducer array. Significant differences are observed in these measures of performance when the size and location of the aperture area used to generate a phase reference signal are varied. Techniques that utilize a small correction reference region are more susceptible to noise and missing elements than techniques which use larger reference regions. The algorithms encounter problems in 2-D phase correction when making the transition from one row to the next, due to the low interelement correlation at the transition points. It is shown that the magnitude of the interelement correlation is the key parameter governing phase correction performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308498.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","startPage":"631","endPage":"643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative evaluation of several algorithms for phase aberration correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparative evaluation of several algorithms for phase aberration correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775532","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative evaluation of several algorithms for phase aberration correction","sourcePdf":"00308498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054898S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"101","articleId":"308498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":308499,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

These estimates are subject to large errors known as false peaks and smaller magnitude errors known as jitter. While false peaks can sometimes be removed through nonlinear processing, jitter errors place a fundamental limit on the performance of delay estimation techniques. This paper applies the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound to derive analytical expressions which predict the magnitude of jitter for 1-D and 2-D problems using both radio frequency (RF) and envelope detected data. One-dimensional simulation results are presented which closely match theoretical predictions. These results indicate that for typical clinical conditions axial jitter for detected data is approximately five times greater than that for RF data. Lateral jitter is approximately ten times greater than axial jitter for RF data. Examples are presented which utilize these results to predict the performance of phase aberration correction and flow estimation systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308499.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.308499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fundamental limit on the performance of correlation based phase correction and flow estimation techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Radio frequency","Phase estimation","Ultrasonic imaging","Motion estimation","Blood","Biological tissues","Motion measurement","Phase measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","acoustic signal processing","correlators","correlation methods","biomedical measurement","flow measurement","haemodynamics","array signal processing","electric distortion","biomedical ultrasonics","cardiology","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clinical conditions","phase correction","flow estimation","cross correlation","ultrasonic imaging","blood motion","soft tissue motion","echo arrival time differences","phase aberration correction","jitter","errors","Cramer-Rao Lower Bound","2-D problems","1-D problems","radio frequency detected data","envelope detected data","one-dimensional simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A fundamental limit on the performance of correlation based phase correction and flow estimation techniques","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fundamental limit on the performance of correlation based phase correction and flow estimation techniques","sourcePdf":"00308499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081108S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"93","articleId":"308499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":308500,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Usually, signals with linear frequency modulation are applied. They can be generated rather easily, but their spectra are not totally matched to the transfer function of ultrasonic systems. In pulse-echo mode operation, with signal duration and consequently the time-bandwidth product being critical parameters, waveforms should be applied which make full use of the available power and bandwidth resources. We report here two methods to improve the overall efficiency of an ultrasonic pulse-echo system. Transmitter signals with constant amplitude level and nonlinear frequency modulation can be generated in such a way that they are spectrally matched to the system. A formula for the calculation of such a matched nonlinear chirp signal is presented. This modulation scheme also leads to a side-lobe level reduction of the compressed pulses. The application of square wave chirps derived from sine type chirps yields an additional gain of echo signal amplitude. Moreover, the complexity of the signal generation hardware is reduced. The methods are illustrated by an example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308500.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chirp signal matching and signal power optimization in pulse-echo mode ultrasonic nondestructive testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308500/","displayDocTitle":"Chirp signal matching and signal power optimization in pulse-echo mode ultrasonic nondestructive testing","volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775534","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chirp signal matching and signal power optimization in pulse-echo mode ultrasonic nondestructive testing","sourcePdf":"00308500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067831S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"119","articleId":"308500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":308502,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

The measurement technique has also been used to evaluate feedback oscillator components, such as the loop and buffer amplifiers, which can play important roles in determining an oscillator's output phase noise spectrum (often in very subtle ways). While some information has previously been published related to component residual phase noise properties, it generally focused on the flicker noise levels of the devices under test, for carrier offset frequencies less than 10 kHz. The work reported herein makes use of an extremely low noise, 500 MHz surface acoustic wave resonator oscillator (SAWRO) test source for residual phase noise measurements, both close-to-and far-from-the-carrier. Using this SAWRO-based test source at 500 MHz, we have been able to achieve a measurement system phase noise floor of -184 dBc/Hz, or better, for carrier offset frequencies greater than 10 kHz, and a system flicker phase noise floor of -150 dBc/Hz, or better, at 1 Hz carrier offset. The paper discusses the results of detailed residual phase noise measurements performed on a number of components using this overall system configuration. Several interesting observations related to the residual phase noise properties of moderate to high power RF amplifiers, i.e., amplifiers with 1 dB gain compression points in the range of +20 to +33 dBm, are highlighted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308502.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308502","doi":"10.1109/58.308502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308502","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Microwave measurements","Noise measurement","Phase measurement","UHF measurements","Oscillators","Acoustic testing","Frequency measurement","Microwave FETs","Gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric noise measurement","microwave amplifiers","ultra-high-frequency amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","microwave measurement","electronic equipment testing","solid-state microwave circuits","silicon","gallium arsenide","phase shifters","frequency dividers","frequency multipliers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual phase noise measurements","microwave components","VHF components","UHF components","microwave amplifiers","bipolar junction transistor","BJT based circuits","field effect transistor","FET based circuits","electronic phase shifters","frequency dividers","frequency multipliers","frequency source applications","frequency synthesizer applications","measurement technique","feedback oscillator components","loop amplifiers","buffer amplifiers","surface acoustic wave resonator oscillator","SAWRO test source","RF amplifiers","500 MHz","Si","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Residual phase noise measurements of VHF, UHF, and microwave components","accessionNumber":"4775536","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual phase noise measurements of VHF, UHF, and microwave components","sourcePdf":"00308502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081705S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"24","articleId":"308502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":308507,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It can also be used in adaptive dynamic focusing, a procedure which enables the phased array to focus at points away from specified control points. The hydrophone array consists of a PVDF sheet, which covers a silicon substrate carrier that contains the signal electrodes of the individual acoustic sensors. A complete description of the hydrophone array and its characteristics is given in this paper. The aberration correction and motion compensation algorithms are also described, and some experimental results are shown. Finally, a Taylor series based adaptive dynamic focusing method for phased arrays based on a set of discrete hydrophone array measurements is described. This algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the applicator geometry and all the parameters needed for correction can be measured directly at the hydrophone array sensor locations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308507","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308507.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic focusing in ultrasound hyperthermia treatments using implantable hydrophone arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic focusing in ultrasound hyperthermia treatments using implantable hydrophone arrays","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4775541","pubMedId":"18263259","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic focusing in ultrasound hyperthermia treatments using implantable hydrophone arrays","sourcePdf":"00308507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073548S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","articleId":"308507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":308508,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

Four different transducer designs have now been considered: oneand two-dimensional linear arrays, annular arrays, and single-element focused pistons commonly used in mechanical sector scanners. The analysis shows that if the backscatter echo spectrum is properly normalized, the shape of the piezoelectric elements affects only the magnitude and not the frequency dependence of the backscatter coefficient estimates. Experimental data were acquired using laboratory and clinical imaging instrumentation to verify the analysis. We compared backscatter coefficients measured as a function of frequency from well-defined scattering media that were obtained using a 1-D linear array and focused piston transducers. Instrument-independent results were found that matched theoretical predictions within the measurement error between 2 and 12 MHz. We conclude from this study that accurate backscatter coefficient estimates may be easily obtained using current clinical imaging instrumentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","startPage":"714","endPage":"723","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308508.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backscatter coefficient estimation using array transducers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Backscatter coefficient estimation using array transducers","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775542","pubMedId":"18263260","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backscatter coefficient estimation using array transducers","sourcePdf":"00308508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092305S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","articleId":"308508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":308509,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Yu Lu","affiliation":["Biodynamics Research Unit, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jian-Yu Lu","id":"37291532700"},{"name":"J.F.

They have possible applications in medical imaging, color Doppler imaging, tissue characterization, and nondestructive evaluation of materials, and in other wave related physical branches such as electromagnetics and optics. However, limited diffraction beams are currently produced with an annular array transducer that has to be steered mechanically. In this paper, we study the feasibility of steering these beams with a two-dimensional array, and show that there will be almost no distortion of beams if the effective aperture reduction of the array is properly compensated so that the beams have a constant transverse profile as they are steered. In addition, methods for reducing the complexity of the electronic multiplexing of the array elements are proposed. We also investigate the influences of the interelement distance and the size of array elements on the sidelobes and grating lobes of limited diffraction beams as the beams are steered. They are similar to those previously reported for conventional beams.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308509","startPage":"724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308509","endPage":"739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of two-dimensional array transducers for limited diffraction beams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A study of two-dimensional array transducers for limited diffraction beams","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4775543","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","pubMedId":"18263261","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of two-dimensional array transducers for limited diffraction beams","sourcePdf":"00308509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067205S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"55","articleId":"308509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":308512,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Unfortunately, the small size of a 2-D array element results in a small clamped capacitance and a large electrical impedance near resonance. These elements have poor sensitivity because their impedance is much higher than the electrical impedance of the transmit and receive circuitry. Sensitivity can be improved by using an N layer structure of PZT ceramic with the layers connected acoustically in series and electrically in parallel. For the multilayer ceramic (MLC), the damped capacitance is multiplied by a factor of N/sup 2/ and the electrical impedance by 1/N/sup 2/ compared to a single layer element of the same dimensions. A 3/spl times/43 phased-array transducer has been fabricated using 3 layer PZT-5H material. Each element had a thickness of 0.66 mm and an area of 0.37/spl times/3.5 mm. The MLC was manufactured using thick film technology with plated-through vias to electrically interconnect the electrode layers. The completed transducer was compared to a single layer control array of similar dimensions. With a light epoxy backing and a /spl lambda//4 matching layer, the MLC array elements had an impedance of 100 /spl Omega/ at series resonance of 2.25 MHz, compared to 800 /spl Omega/ for the control elements. The lower impedance of the MLC elements resulted in a minimum round-trip insertion loss of 24.0 dB, compared to an 34.1 dB for the control array elements. These results were consistent with KLM modeling. B-scan images were made of cysts in a tissue-mimicking phantom and of the left kidney in vivo. The images clearly showed a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the MLC array compared to the control. As a result, 2-D arrays made of multilayer ceramics can be used to form images at a higher frequency and greater range than single layer arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.308512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.308512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7510","startPage":"761","endPage":"771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7510/00308512.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=308512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Ceramics","Impedance","Ultrasonic imaging","Phased arrays","Capacitance","Resonance","Transducers","Bioceramics","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ceramics","lead compounds","piezoelectric materials","electric impedance","capacitance","ultrasonic delay lines","acoustic delay lines","biomedical ultrasonics","focusing","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer piezoelectric ceramics","two-dimensional array transducers","2D array transducers","medical ultrasound imaging","dynamic focusing","phase-correction","elevation dimension","real-time volumetric scanning","mall size","2D array element","small clamped capacitance","large electrical impedance","resonance","poor sensitivity","receive circuitry","transmit circuitry","sensitivity","N layer structure","PZT ceramic","damped capacitance","3/spl times/43 phased-array transducer","thick film technology","0.66 mm","0.37 mm","3.5 mm","2.25 MHz","24 dB","34.1 dB","JkJkPbZrO3TiO3"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer piezoelectric ceramics for two-dimensional array transducers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4775546","pubMedId":"18263264","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/308512/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer piezoelectric ceramics for two-dimensional array transducers","sourcePdf":"00308512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05417S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"109","articleId":"308512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":308533,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37278086600"},{"name":"A.

The performance of DSC is on average, comparable to, or even better than, other higher-complexity algorithms. We assume no task duplication and nonzero communication overhead between processors. Finding the optimum solution for arbitrary directed acyclic task graphs (DAG's) is NP-complete. DSC finds optimal schedules for special classes of DAG's, such as fork, join, coarse-grain trees, and some fine-grain trees. It guarantees a performance within a factor of 2 of the optimum for general coarse-grain DAG's. We compare DSC with three higher-complexity general scheduling algorithms: the ETF by J.J. Hwang, Y.C. Chow, F.D. Anger, and C.Y. Lee (1989); V. Sarkar's (1989) clustering algorithm; and the MD by M.Y. Wu and D. Gajski (1990).

Bunches from the injector (the SPS accelerator) are fairly long (51 cm full length compared to the RF wavelength of 75 cm) and phase injection errors may bring the edge of the injected bunch very close to the separatrix. Following the SPS collider experience, it is therefore of prime importance to quickly damp any phase (or energy) error at injection in order to avoid capture losses as much as possible. The main LHC RF system is composed of eight single cell 400 MHz superconducting cavities, which are common to both beams and cannot be used to act independently on a newly injected batch. Dedicated cavities (or longitudinal kickers) working on each beam separately will provide damping of phase oscillations just after injection; they may also be used to suppress any coupled bunch longitudinal instability during coast.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAC.1993.309328","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Particle Accelerators","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Particle Accelerators","pdfPath":"/iel2/1060/7512/00309328.pdf","startPage":"2379","endPage":"2381 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/PAC.1993.309328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of phase errors at injection in the LHC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Damping of phase errors at injection in the LHC","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4754783","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/309328/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of phase errors at injection in the LHC","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00309328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024922S","chronDate":"17-20 May 1993","isNumber":"7512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1060","citationCount":"2","articleId":"309328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":309427,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In order to provide beam stability and to maximize power extraction efficiency for a flat beam with a finite width, we have designed RF cavities in which the electric field is nearly constant across the width of the beam (on the order of several wavelengths). However, in such cavities, the electric field in the fundamental mode can couple to the TE propagating mode in the drift section if any cavity or beam asymmetry is present. The dipole field can couple between adjacent cavities even in the absence of these asymmetries as long as the frequency is above cutoff of the drift tube. The effects of coupling between RF cavities are calculated using an equivalent circuit model. Threshold parameters for onset of RF oscillation in the fundamental mode as a result of cavity coupling are obtained.

Experimental results have successfully proven the capability of the proposed new filter implementation method in realizing VHF bandpass filters with the center frequency higher than 100 MHz when C/sub d/=1 pF. The deviations of the measured center frequency f/sub o/ and quality factor Q of the fabricated bandpass filter from the simulated results are less than 8%. The deviation of the center frequency can be post-tuned by adjusting the control voltages V/sub CN/ and V/sub CP/ of the tunable R/sub m/ amplifier. With 1 pF differentiating capacitor, the center frequency of the fabricated VHF R/sub m/-C bandpass filters can be tuned in a wide range larger than 30 MHz. The measured maximum signal level is 25 mV/sub rms/ and the dynamic range is 47 dB. The chip area is 0.05 mm/sup 2/ and power consumption is 5.05 mW with /spl plusmn/2.5 V power supply.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.309901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7514/00309901.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1067","doi":"10.1109/4.309901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design techniques for tunable transresistance-C VHF bandpass filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design techniques for tunable transresistance-C VHF bandpass filters","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4780812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/309901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design techniques for tunable transresistance-C VHF bandpass filters","sourcePdf":"00309901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048213S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","articleId":"309901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":309902,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

The area and power budget of conventionally designed oversampled analog-to-digital converters has precluded their application from areas where a large number of low frequency signals need to be converted simultaneously. A new oversampled A/D design methodology is proposed to cut the area and power budget per channel of an oversampled analog-to-digital converter. The design and implementation of a 16-channel oversampled analog-to-digital converter is presented which can be used as the core of the multichannel data acquisition system.

In analog neural LSI's with on-chip backpropagation learning, inevitable offset errors that arise in the learning circuits seriously degrade the learning performance. Using the learning procedure proposed here, offset errors are canceled to a large extent and the effect of offset errors on the learning performance is minimized. This paper also describes a prototype LSI with 9 neurons and 81 synapses based on the proposed architecture which is capable of continuous neuron-state and continuous-time operation because of its fully analog and fully parallel property. Therefore, an analog neural system made by combining LSI's with feedback connections is promising for implementing continuous-time models of recurrent networks with real-time learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/309904/","volume":"29","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4780815","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An all-analog expandable neural network LSI with on-chip backpropagation learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all-analog expandable neural network LSI with on-chip backpropagation learning","sourcePdf":"00309904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031142S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"77","articleId":"309904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":309905,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In case of uniform tapering, we can obtain an analytical solution of the optimum tapering factor for a minimum power-delay product, which is about 1.5/spl sim/2 times larger than that for a minimum propagation delay. It is also found that there exists a nonuniform tapering factor which gives a global optimum condition for a minimum power-delay product, which, however, results in a larger short-circuit current.

The cross shaped aperture in the ground plane provides coupling between the microstrip patch and a single microstrip line underneath the ground plane, traversing the four arms of the cross in a serial manner, thereby generating four coupling points in phase quadratures for both senses of circular polarization. The analysis of this antenna incorporates two stages: In the first one, the individual load impedances are computed via an integral equation based on reciprocity, assuming no interactions between the ports. The second stage employs a transmission line model where the four coupling points are considered as lumped loads along the feed line. An iterative scheme employs the transmission line model for the determination of the actual impedances of each coupling point, including the mutual interactions with the other coupling points. This procedure provides control over the overall level of radiated energy; hence it can be used in the design procedure of this antenna as a serial or parallel fed array element. The computed results agree very well with measurements. The antenna attains a -3 dB gain bandwidth of 13% to 15%, a 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 48%, and -15 dB return loss bandwidth of 60%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a dual circularly polarized microstrip antenna fed by crossed slots","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.309996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7516/00309996.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.309996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=309996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/309996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a dual circularly polarized microstrip antenna fed by crossed slots","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761431","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a dual circularly polarized microstrip antenna fed by crossed slots","sourcePdf":"00309996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02994S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","articleId":"309996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
