But it is certain that there is no way around biometrics-based identification if we insist on positive, reliable, and irrefutable identification. As fraud in our society grows, as the pressure to deliver inexpensive authentication services mounts, and as geographically mobile individuals increasingly need to establish their identity as strangers in remote communities, the problem of reliable personal identification becomes more and more difficult. To catapult biometric technology into the mainstream identification market, it is important to encourage its evaluation in realistic contexts, to facilitate its integration into end-to-end solutions, and to foster innovation of inexpensive and user-friendly implementations. We hope that a pervasive, accountable use of biometrics technology will help establish a more open and fair society.","doi":"10.1109/2.820038","publicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"46","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.820038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17784","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/17784/00820038.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","Distributed databases","Image databases","Spatial databases","Security","Biosensors","Airports","Access control","Medical services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Biometrics: The future of identification [Guest Eeditors' Introduction]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820038/","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometrics: The future of identification [Guest Eeditors' Introduction]","sourcePdf":"00820038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021689S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"115","articleId":"820038","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":820039,"authors":[{"name":"A.

But that technology will be a stillbirth without new interfaces for interaction, minus a keyboard or mouse. To win wide consumer acceptance, these interactions must be friendly and personalized; the next generation interfaces must recognize people in their immediate environment and, at a minimum, know who they are. In this article, the authors discuss face recognition technology, how it works, problems to be overcome, current technologies, and future developments and possible applications. Twenty years ago, the problem of face recognition was considered among the most difficult in artificial intelligence and computer vision. Today, however, there are several companies that sell commercial face recognition software that is capable of high-accuracy recognition with databases of more than 1,000 people. The authors describe the face recognition technology used, explaining the algorithms for face recognition as well as novel applications, such as behavior monitoring that assesses emotions based on facial expressions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820039/","volume":"33","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6499570","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition for smart environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition for smart environments","sourcePdf":"00820039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028614S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"136","articleId":"820039","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820040,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

The authors designed this article to provide sufficient information to know what questions to ask when evaluating a biometric system, and to assist in determining whether performance levels meet the requirements of an application. For example, a low-performance biometric is probably sufficient for reducing-as opposed to eliminating-fraud. Likewise, completely replacing an existing security system with a biometric-based one may require a high-performance biometric system, or the required performance may be beyond what current technology can provide. Of the biometrics that give the user some control over data acquisition, voice, face, and fingerprint systems have undergone the most study and testing-and therefore occupy the bulk of this discussion.

Biometric features such as the face or a fingerprint can be stored on a microchip in a credit card, for example. A single feature, however, sometimes fails to be exact enough for identification. Another disadvantage of using only one feature is that the chosen feature is not always readable. Dialog Communication Systems (DCS AG) developed BioID, a multimodal identification system that uses three different features-face, voice, and lip movement-to identify people. With its three modalities, BioID achieves much greater accuracy than single-feature systems. Even if one modality is somehow disturbed-for example, if a noisy environment drowns out the voice-the ether two modalities still lead to an accurate identification. This article goes into detail about the system functions, explaining the data acquisition and preprocessing techniques for voice, facial, and lip imagery data. The authors also explain the classification principles used for optical features and the sensor fusion options (the combinations of the three results-face, voice, lip movement-to obtain varying levels of security).","doi":"10.1109/2.820041","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/17784/00820041.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.820041","publicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BiolD: a multimodal biometric identification system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"BiolD: a multimodal biometric identification system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820041/","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6507736","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BiolD: a multimodal biometric identification system","sourcePdf":"00820041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039827S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"217","articleId":"820041","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":820051,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Unlike previous algorithms, the algorithm proposed here meets this need well by using heuristics that exploit structure present in classifiers. Our approach, which we call HiCuts (hierarchical intelligent cuttings), attempts to partition the search space in each dimension, guided by simple heuristics that exploit the classifier's structure. We discover this structure by preprocessing the classifier. We can tune the algorithm's parameters to trade off query time against storage requirements. In classifying packets based on four header fields, HiCuts performs quickly and requires relatively little storage compared with previously described algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/40.820051","startPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel5/40/17785/00820051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.820051","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying packets with hierarchical intelligent cuttings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Classifying packets with hierarchical intelligent cuttings","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6499445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifying packets with hierarchical intelligent cuttings","sourcePdf":"00820051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033874S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"213","articleId":"820051","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820127,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In GMAW, weld bead shape affects a number of welding parameters including; welding current, voltage, speed and weaving length. To detect weld bead shape, we select proper welding parameters. We have difficulty analyzing the relationship between weld bead shape and welding parameters due to non-linearity of the welding process. In the case of an arc sensor, though it has a signal processing problem, it is still a widely-used method in industry because it is low cost and easily automated. Proper welding parameters were selected and a weld bead shape detecting system was proposed, using neural networks which were able to identify the relation between weld bead shape and the welding parameters. Also, in the neural controller, the time delay neural network (TDNN) was used in this proposed neural network, due to non-linearity of the welding process. Besides, in welding quality testing, it is important to analyze the weld bead shape. Proper welding parameters and fifteen points that represent weld bead shape were selected, and a real-time monitoring system of weld bead shape was proposed to find the effects of various welding parameters and estimate weld quality using neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1999.820158","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Third International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information Engineering Systems.

A Hopfield-type neural network is a method that is often used to solve problems such as the traveling salesman problem. However, it is difficult to find an optimal solution because it is based on gradient descent and its energy function has many local minima. Therefore, many attempts have been made to find ways of escaping from local minima and to find better solutions. T. Tanaka et al. (1996) succeeded in improving the solutions by controlling the coefficient of the energy function. However, their results were not completely satisfying in terms of the quality of the solutions and the computation time. In order to find better solutions in a short time, we introduced a method called tabu search into a Hopfield-type neural network. Tabu search is a simple and flexible method for obtaining good solutions quickly and has been applied to NP-complete problems. Through computer simulations, better solutions were obtained than those obtained by using an ordinary model. Moreover, the computation time was reduced.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1999.820237","startPage":"518","endPage":"521","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Third International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information Engineering Systems.

In this spirit, we have asked a set of distinguished scholars and practitioners who were involved in AI's formative stages to describe the most notable trend or controversy (or nontrend or noncontroversy) during AI's development. The responses provide an interesting characterization of AI-and, in many ways, of the people of AI. We gave our contributors a great deal of flexibility in the nature of their responses. Some provided grand summaries of the history of the field as a whole. Others commented insightfully on more focused topics. Some observed changes and changed along with them. Others are still making advances on research agendas articulated presciently long ago. Some are optimistic. Others are pessimistic. Despite the range, both individually and collectively they provide insights into where we have been and where we are going. Although each contribution is a unique expression of its author's glimpse back through AI's development, there is repetition of important themes that are at the discipline's core. The article serves as an interesting record of where AI is today, as well as setting the stage for what's to come.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6508622","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AI's greatest trends and controversies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AI's greatest trends and controversies","sourcePdf":"00820322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061741S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"9","articleId":"820322","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Besides the obvious advantages of increasing road safety and improving the quality and efficiency of moving people and goods around, the integration of intelligent features and autonomous functionalities in vehicles will lead to major economic benefits, including reduced fuel consumption, efficient exploitation of the road network and reduced personnel. Furthermore, it is not only the automotive field (public transportation, trucks and automobiles) that is interested in these new technologies, but also other sectors, each with its own target (industrial vehicles, military systems, mission-critical systems and unmanned rescue robots).

In this paper, a novel hybrid of the adaptive array and equalizer (NHAE) system is proposed to combat the problems of insufficient degrees of freedom and mainbeam multipath interferers. The NHAE utilizes a modified training sequence to adjust the weight vector of the array that leads the array to cancel only the cochannel interferers. The ISI which is caused by the multipath interferers and the transmission system is removed by the equalizer following the array. Therefore, the array in the NHAE may need a fewer number of the elements than the conventional array which cancels both the cochannel interferers and multipath interferers. Besides, the presence of the mainbeam multipath interferers, which may seriously degrade the performance of the AE, has much less effect on the NHAE since it is suppressed by the equalizer instead of by the array. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the merits of the NHAE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820692/","volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501318","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"A novel hybrid of adaptive array and equalizer for mobile communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hybrid of adaptive array and equalizer for mobile communications","sourcePdf":"00820692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036626S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","articleId":"820692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":820693,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Geun Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Geun Jeong","id":"37274431000"},{"name":"Wha Sook Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wha Sook Jeon","id":"37280516300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"820693","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Cellular networks","Costs","Intserv networks","Protocols","Communication system control","Control systems","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","integrated voice/data communication","protocols","telecommunication control","personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data transmission scheme","CDMA wireless networks","IS-95","cellular voice systems","implementation cost","voice/data integrated service","code-division multiple-access","digital cellular system","J-STD-008 personal communications systems","protocol","control schemes","voice mobile stations","performance","1.8 to 2.0 GHz","800 to 900 MHz"]}],"abstract":"Data integration into the existing cellular voice systems is an attractive approach since it can reduce an initial implementation cost of the data network and can provide voice/data integrated services. In this paper, we propose a data transmission scheme for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) cellular voice systems. The CDMA systems under consideration include IS-95 digital cellular systems using the 800-900-MHz band and J-STD-008 personal communications systems using the 1.8-2.0-GHz band. The proposed protocol and control schemes are designed for real systems based on IS-95 rather than conceptual systems and require no modifications to the existing voice mobile stations (MSs). Using computer simulation, the performance of voice and data users is evaluated. As a result, we show that the proposed scheme well meets our design goals, which are that the data transmission scheme should not only provide a good data performance, but also have little effect on the voice performance.","doi":"10.1109/25.820693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data transmission scheme for CDMA wireless networks based on IS-95","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A data transmission scheme for CDMA wireless networks based on IS-95","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data transmission scheme for CDMA wireless networks based on IS-95","sourcePdf":"00820693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057869S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","articleId":"820693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":820694,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Gui","affiliation":["Division of Communication, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiang Gui","id":"37087297229"},{"name":"Tung Sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tung Sang Ng","id":"37087143255"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"820694","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a chip-interleaving direct-sequence (DS) spread-spectrum (SS) system.

The microcell-to-macrocell interference is derived in closed form by geometric approximation, and the macrocell-to-microcell interference is calculated on the divided regions of macrocell. The optimal tilt angle is obtained by defining the minimum interference tradeoff factor that maximizes the system capacity.

The receiver with a multistage decision-directed channel estimator makes alternate use of symbol detection and channel estimation in an iterative manner, resulting in a multistage structure where each stage consists of an estimator and a detector. The estimator obtains the estimates of the channel by using the decisions from the detector in the previous stage, and the detector uses these estimates for coherent detection of the transmitted symbols. Modifications to the process of generating the channel estimates and the decision variables are made to mitigate the error propagation in successive stages. It is shown that the performance of the proposed estimation scheme is better than the conventional scheme, especially for channels with high diversity order. The gain is mostly achieved by two stages for channels with low diversity order and by five stages for channels with high diversity order.

A soft-output equalizer increases the impact of this combination by enabling the use of soft-decision Viterbi decoding. It is well known that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm provides optimal reliability information, but at the cost of substantial complexity. This paper contains the results of an investigation into the design and performance of soft-output adaptive equalization techniques based on suboptimum trellis-based soft-output decoding algorithms.

The results show that the more suitable cell shape with respect to handoff traffic and its signaling load is determined by the probability of straight movement at an intersection.

In contrast to previous investigations, no restrictive assumptions about the impulse response of the channel and/or sampling time are made, and closed-form analytical expressions for the error floor and optimum sampling time are derived. It is found that, generally, the error probability depends on the variance of relative delay (which conforms to the conventional RMS delay spread) as well as on the product of mean relative delays of echoes advancing and succeeding the chosen sampling time, weighted by corresponding mean powers. This implies that (elsewhere widely accepted) simple determination of the error floor by RMS delay spread only can now be seen as a special case when sampling is at mean delay and distribution of the delay profile's power around it is balanced. Furthermore, it is shown that the novel formula reflects the impact of delay profile shape on the error performance (that has been usually neglected, although not always justifiably), and that in general case, the optimum sampling instant is not at the mean delay. The theoretical results are verified by comparison with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations' results; achieved agreement lies within the accuracy of the simulations.","doi":"10.1109/25.820704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820704.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the error floor of MSK signal transmission over a multipath channel with small time dispersion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"On the error floor of MSK signal transmission over a multipath channel with small time dispersion","volume":"49","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501330","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820704/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the error floor of MSK signal transmission over a multipath channel with small time dispersion","sourcePdf":"00820704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030997S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"820704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":820705,"authors":[{"name":"Tik-Bin Oon","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"lastName":"Tik-Bin Oon","id":"37372384100"},{"name":"R.

The performance of this scheme is evaluated via analysis and simulation. In our analysis, we develop a model to consider the impact of wrongly estimating the phase and amplitude of the channel impulse response on the successive concatenated cancellation scheme. Analysis and simulation results in flat Rayleigh fading asynchronous channels with both perfect and nonperfect channel estimation and with perfect ranking confirms the accuracy of our analytical model as well as the significant improvement in performance compared to the conventional single-user matched filter (MF) detection and the stand-alone parallel cancellation schemes. Analytical results also show that the concatenated scheme has the potential to reach the single-user performance bound for a wide range of user base size, up to K=120 users, with a processing gain of 127 using one serial and three parallel cancellation stages. Finally, we propose a method whereby the receiver adapts with the number of users in order to retain the bit error ratio (BER) performance while decreasing the processing delay.","doi":"10.1109/25.820705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820705.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of an adaptive successive serial-parallel CDMA cancellation scheme in flat Rayleigh fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Performance of an adaptive successive serial-parallel CDMA cancellation scheme in flat Rayleigh fading channels","volume":"49","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6501331","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820705/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of an adaptive successive serial-parallel CDMA cancellation scheme in flat Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00820705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080687S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","articleId":"820705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":820706,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

RAKE combining methods, a simple integral demodulation method within a time window, and a recursive least squares (RLS) demodulation method within the time window that uses the RLS algorithm to realize maximal ratio combining, are investigated. It is found that TWCL performance with delay paths (double-spike frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading model) surpasses the performance of both acquisition and tracking without delay paths (nonfrequency-selective Rayleigh-fading model) because of the path-diversity effect. The laboratory results show that TWCL provides good acquisition and tracking performance under the fading conditions experienced with maximum Doppler frequencies of 5 or 80 Hz. It is also shown that the signal energy per bit to noise-power spectral-density ratio (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) required to achieve the bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -3/ under the double-spike frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading model is reduced by 10 dB compared to the nonfrequency-selective Rayleigh-fading model.

The conditional PDF, whose coefficients can be computed efficiently in a recursive manner, significantly reduces the computational complexity of forward-link bit error rate (BER) evaluation of a direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) cellular system over a fading channel, BER curves reveal that the performance improvement of increasing m is not significant for m>4. Performance results for noninteger values of m can be estimated using the linear interpolation technique. With the derived BER expressions, a more realistic cellular model that takes into account the effects of nonidentical m and path-loss exponent is proposed and analyzed. By substituting appropriate values of m, the BER performance for a class of fading distributions such as Rayleigh and Ricean fading can be evaluated or approximated. In particular, the Nakagami approximation may be treated as a tight lower bound to the corresponding mathematically involved Ricean case.","doi":"10.1109/25.820709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820709.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward-link BER analysis of asynchronous cellular DS-CDMA over Nakagami-faded channels using combined PDF approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820709/","displayDocTitle":"Forward-link BER analysis of asynchronous cellular DS-CDMA over Nakagami-faded channels using combined PDF approach","volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501335","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward-link BER analysis of asynchronous cellular DS-CDMA over Nakagami-faded channels using combined PDF approach","sourcePdf":"00820709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055413S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"820709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":820712,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Consequently, depending on the channel correlation, successive symbols transmitted over the channel can suffer from very similar or possibly very different fading conditions. In this paper, we present an analytical model to evaluate the effect of mobile velocity on the performance of a communication system operating in a multipath fading channel. To incorporate the effect of velocity, a Markov process is used which captures the correlated nature of the channel. An error recursion is then developed which considers the effect of closed-loop power control, channel coding, and finite interleaving. In the numerical analysis, we use the analytical model to investigate the tradeoffs when these various schemes are used. We demonstrate how the performance of these different schemes is sensitive to mobile velocity.","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820712.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820712","doi":"10.1109/25.820712","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820712","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Fading","Power control","Power system modeling","Markov processes","Interleaved codes","Power capacitors","Analytical models","Binary phase shift keying","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","fading channels","multipath channels","Markov processes","telecommunication control","power control","channel coding","phase shift keying","interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error recursion","mobile velocity","channel variation rate","channel correlation","fading conditions","analytical model","communication system performance","multipath fading channel","Markov process","correlated channel","closed-loop power control","channel coding","finite interleaving","numerical analysis","finite state channel","binary phase shift keying","BPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Effect of mobile velocity on communications in fading channels","accessionNumber":"6501338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","volume":"49","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of mobile velocity on communications in fading channels","sourcePdf":"00820712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024873S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"39","articleId":"820712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":820713,"authors":[{"name":"L.V.

The theoretical efficiency of the LINC power amplifier has been reported as 100% since highly efficient nonlinear constant amplitude amplifiers can be used. However, the 100% efficiency performance is only possible at one or two loads along the power output curve. The bulk of the papers regarding LINC has focused on clever implementations of the signal vector decomposition as well as methods to achieve highly linear signal separation. There has been little regard in the literature to the signal combiner implementation necessary to achieve the high power-added efficiency (PAE) of the LINC radio frequency (RF) power amplifier. Efficiency is not an intrinsic property of the combiner implementations, however, the combiner method is the single biggest contributor to efficient performance of a LINC RF power amplifier. This paper develops an analysis method that determines the efficiency of the LINC power amplifier as a function of the amplitude modulation statistics. This can be employed to design the RF communication system amplitude modulation characteristics and to tradeoff and optimize the RF transmitter PAE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LINC power amplifier combiner method efficiency optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.820715","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17792/00820715.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.820715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"LINC power amplifier combiner method efficiency optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501341","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LINC power amplifier combiner method efficiency optimization","sourcePdf":"00820715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055141S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"55","articleId":"820715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820718,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When the product of Doppler-related signal bandwidth spread and multipath-related time spread of the channel is larger than one, some types of adaptive signal processing may not work very well. In this paper, various methods of coherent space-time processing are compared for a condition of a marginally overspread channel operating at 50 kHz. Various combinations of suboptimal spatially adaptive and time adaptive methods are considered. The coherent path beamformer (CPB) and recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive beamformer, both in combination with RLS time filtering, are analyzed. Also considered in the analysis is the combined RLS space-time optimal adaptive processor. Many experiments using broad-band phase-shift-keyed transmissions in shallow water have been conducted to provide data for testing these various processing methods. Because of the rapid time variation of the multipath, the product of bandwidth spread and time spread at this test site approached unity. In this environment, a suboptimal approach consisting of the adaptive beamformer followed by RLS equalization reduced reverberation and transmission errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal processing of coherent acoustic communication data in shallow water","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/48.820735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/17790/00820735.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.820735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-temporal processing of coherent acoustic communication data in shallow water","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501425","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-temporal processing of coherent acoustic communication data in shallow water","sourcePdf":"00820735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044852S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"18","articleId":"820735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820736,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Underwater acoustic (UWA) networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean-bottom sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, and a surface station, which provides a link to an on-shore control center. While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task. The goal of this paper is to survey the existing network technology and its applicability to underwater acoustic channels. In addition, we present a shallow-water acoustic network example and outline some future research directions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","volume":"25","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6501428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic networks","sourcePdf":"00820738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046594S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"614","articleId":"820738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":820747,"authors":[{"name":"R.

First, we present a thruster model incorporating the effects of rotational fluid velocity and inertia on thruster response. Second, we report a novel method for experimentally determining nonsinusoidal lift/drag curves. The model parameters are identified using experimental thruster data (force, torque, and fluid velocity). The models are evaluated by comparing experimental performance data with numerical model simulations. The data indicates that thruster models incorporating both reported enhancements provide superior accuracy in both transient and steady-state responses.","doi":"10.1109/48.820747","startPage":"146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/17790/00820747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.820747","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate four-quadrant nonlinear dynamical model for marine thrusters: theory and experimental validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"An accurate four-quadrant nonlinear dynamical model for marine thrusters: theory and experimental validation","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6501436","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate four-quadrant nonlinear dynamical model for marine thrusters: theory and experimental validation","sourcePdf":"00820747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059068S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"86","articleId":"820747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820756,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbing Li","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yanbing Li","id":"37066647500"},{"name":"M.

The resulting power macromodel, consisting of a single four-dimensional table, can be used to estimate the power consumed in the circuit for any given input/output signal statistics. Given a low-level (typically gate-level) description of the circuit, we describe a characterization process by which such a table model can be automatically built. The four dimensions of our table-based model are the average input signal probability, average input transition density, average spatial correlation coefficient, and average output zero-delay transition density. This approach has been implemented and models have been built for many benchmark circuits. Over a wide range of input signal statistics, we show that this model gives very good accuracy, with an rms error of about 4% and average error of about 6%. Except for one out of about 10 000 cases, the largest error observed was under 20%. If one ignores the glitching activity, then the rms error becomes under 1%, the average error becomes under 5%, and the largest error observed in all cases is under 18%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power modeling for high-level power estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.820758","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17795/00820758.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.820758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Power modeling for high-level power estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6527737","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power modeling for high-level power estimation","sourcePdf":"00820758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041684S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"92","articleId":"820758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":820759,"authors":[{"name":"M.A.S.

A key aspect of these systems is their programmable routing architecture which is the manner in which wires, FPGAs and field-programmable interconnect devices (FPIDs) are connected. Several routing architectures for MFSs have been proposed, and previous research has shown that the partial crossbar is one of the best existing architectures. In this paper, we propose a new routing architecture, called the hybrid complete-graph and partial-crossbar (HCGP) which has superior speed and cost compared to a partial crossbar. The new architecture uses both hard-wired and programmable connections between the FPGAs. We compare the performance and cost of the HCGP and partial crossbar architectures experimentally, by mapping a set of 15 large benchmark circuits into each architecture. A customized set of partitioning and interchip routing tools were developed, with particular attention paid to architecture-appropriate interchip routing algorithms. We show that the cost of the partial crossbar (as measured by the number of pins on all FPGAs and FPIDs required to fit a design), is on average 20% more than the new HCGP architecture and as much as 25% more. Furthermore, the critical path delay for designs implemented on the partial crossbar were on average 20% more than the HCGP architecture and up to 43% more. Using our experimental approach, we also explore a key architecture parameter associated with the HCGP architecture-the proportion of hard-wired connections versus programmable connections-to determine its best value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6527738","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"A novel and efficient routing architecture for multi-FPGA systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel and efficient routing architecture for multi-FPGA systems","sourcePdf":"00820759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060418S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","articleId":"820759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":820761,"authors":[{"name":"Jer Min Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jer Min Jou","id":"37289288700"},{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pei-Yin Chen","id":"37311131600"},{"name":"Sheng-Fu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Fu Yang","id":"37440427900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"820761","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":364},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fuzzy logic","Very large scale integration","Hardware","Fuzzy systems","Control systems","Adaptive systems","Signal generators","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","fuzzy control","VLSI","integrated circuit design","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","high-speed integrated circuits","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy logic controller","VLSI architecture","hardware design","adaptive fuzzy inference","symbolic fuzzy rule format","dynamic membership function generator","high-speed integration capability","membership function"]}],"abstract":"Most previous work about the hardware design of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) intended to either improve its inference performance for real-time applications or to reduce its hardware cost.

The purpose of this paper is to present such an adaptive memory-efficient FLC and its applications. Taking advantage of the adaptability provided by a symbolic fuzzy rule format and the dynamic membership function generator, as well as the high-speed integration capability afforded by VLSI, the proposed adaptive fuzzy logic controller (AFLC) can perform an adaptive fuzzy inference process using various inference parameters, such as the shape and location of a membership function, dynamically and quickly. Three examples are used to illustrate its applications, and the experimental results show the excellent adaptability provided by AFLC.","doi":"10.1109/92.820761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17795/00820761.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.820761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=820761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive fuzzy logic controller: its VLSI architecture and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820761/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive fuzzy logic controller: its VLSI architecture and applications","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6527740","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive fuzzy logic controller: its VLSI architecture and applications","sourcePdf":"00820761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041199S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"35","articleId":"820761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":820764,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, many papers in the literature have used a single moment approach and assumed an average fixed value of CDMA capacity in mathematical analyses. In this paper we propose an analysis that takes into account the time-varying nature of CDMA capacity. We assume, from the central limit theorem, that the system interference is Gaussian and propose an expression for the system capacity. We then present a traffic model for a power controlled DS-CDMA network where only handoff calls are queued. Network performance is computed in terms of the carried traffic, the queue length and the probability of blocking new and handoff calls.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.1999.820783","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Africon. 5th Africon Conference in Africa (Cat.

The Gabor wavelets are also used in the disparity estimation process to resolve a 3-D representation of the face. The recognition is conducted by examining how well the stored meshes can be projected onto the image pair to be tested, using camera calibration data.

In order to reduce the required chip area for the sequential processing of 2 K complex data, a DRAM-like pipelined commutator architecture is used. The 16-point FFT is a basic building block of the entire FFT chip, and the 2048-point FFT consists of the cascaded blocks with five stages of radix-4 and one stage of radix-2. Since each stage requires rounding of the resulting bits while maintaining the proper S/N ratio, the convergent block floating point (CBFP) algorithm is used for the effective internal bit rounding. As a result, the proposed structure brings about the 55% chip size reduction compared with the conventional approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICVC '99. 6th International Conference on VLSI and CAD (Cat.

Lowering supply voltage (V/sub DD/) is very effective in reducing the power but the threshold voltage (V/sub TH/) should be reduced at the same time for high-speed operation. The low V/sub TH/ however, increases the leakage current. To overcome this situation, V/sub TH/ and V/sub DD/ control through the use of multiple V/sub TH/, variable V/sub TH/, multiple V/sub DD/ and variable V/sub DD/ are being pursued. At the system level, a system LSI approach is promising for realizing low power. The new trend is to exploit the cooperation of software and hardware. For sub 1-volt design, abnormal temperature dependence of drain current may be important. The interconnection will determine cost, delay, power, reliability and turn-around time of future LSI's. The RC delay problem can be solved through an LSI architecture realizing \"the further, the less communication\" with the help of local memories. The complexity issue can only be solved by the sharing and re-use of design data, and the so-called IP-based design will be preferable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/820921/","accessionNumber":"6589264","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LSI design toward 2010 and low-power technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LSI design toward 2010 and low-power technology","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00820921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020228S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6645","citationCount":"2","articleId":"820921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":820929,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In our technology mapping algorithm, a given logic equation is constructed as the DAG type, then the DAG is reconstructed by replicating the node that outdegree is more than or equal to 2. As a result, it makes delay time and the number of CLBs to be minimized. Also, after the number of multi-level is defined and cost of each nodes is calculated, the graph is partitioned in order to fit to k that is the number of OR term within CLB. The partitioned nodes are merged through collapsing and bin packing is performed in order to fit to the number of OR term within CLB. In the results of experiments to MCNC circuits for logic synthesis benchmark, we can shows that proposed technology mapping algorithm reduces delay time and the number of CLBs much more than the existing tools of technology mapping algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICVC '99. 6th International Conference on VLSI and CAD (Cat.

As for the methods for identifying vehicles, while an image processing method for recognizing vehicles by reading the license plate numbers has already been put into practical use, there is no precedence of its application to priority signal control. Therefore, focusing on priority signal control of route buses, we proposed a method for identifying the individual route numbers of the route buses. Considering the ease of processing, we based this method on a template matching process that targets route numbers. However, with this method, the correlation values fluctuate greatly due to the changes in the external environment, which poses the problem of greatly reducing the judgment precision if simple threshold values are used. This paper describes the identification method using the above-mentioned template matching process and its problems, and proposes an identification method that uses a new recognition algorithm for solving those problems. Furthermore, to verify the recognition precision of this method, we carried out an application on an actual road, which resulted in an accuracy rate of 99.6%, which is sufficient for practical use.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 199 IEEE/IEEJ/JSAI International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (Cat.

Algorithms for merging control of vehicles using the concept of a virtual vehicle and for inter-vehicle communication for the control are presented. A virtual vehicle is generated by mapping a vehicle on one lane onto another lane, in order to enable longitudinal control between a vehicle on a main lane and one on a sub lane to make smooth merging. The inter-vehicle communication is essential in the merging control algorithm, because the generation of the virtual vehicle requires the inter-vehicle communication. The data transmission in the communication consists of an intra-platoon algorithm and an inter-platoon one. The former is featured by provision of the interruption detective gaps that allow us to reduce transmission delay caused by collision, and the latter is featured by data transmission only between lead vehicles. Simulation results show the efficiency of the data transmission and the feasibility of merging control using the data transmission algorithm. When a platoon consists of ten vehicles, the transmission rate is three times as efficient as the conventional algorithm and it is sufficient for merging control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6529865","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A merging control algorithm based on inter-vehicle communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A merging control algorithm based on inter-vehicle communication","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00821160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079144S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6644","citationCount":"58","articleId":"821160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":821187,"authors":[{"name":"Swee Meng Wong","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Swee Meng Wong","id":"37438197600"},{"name":"Ming Xie","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Ming Xie","id":"37274877200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4975-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"821187","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Vehicle detection","Navigation","Intelligent vehicles","Driver circuits","Humans","Road accidents","Robustness","Intelligent sensors","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","active vision","Global Positioning System","road vehicles","mobile robots","image sensors","accidents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lane geometry detection","smart vehicle guidance","road traffic accidents","human error","danger","electronic driver","sensors","active vision system","GPS","human driver assistance","perception","CyCab"]}],"abstract":"Numerous road traffic accidents occur because the human driver fails to perceive the danger due to human error, or simply drives too rashly.

In this paper, co-channel interference for several different CDMA architectures is evaluated. For wideband CDMA systems such as W-CDMA and cdma2000 with carrier stealing, co-channel interference is significantly reduced by the implementation of either microzoning or sectoring. The disadvantage of microzoning is that intra-cell interference is no longer ideally zero on the forward channel, as it is with sectoring and omnidirectional architectures. For wideband CDMA systems such as cdma2000 without carrier stealing, co-channel interference is reduced by both microzoning and sectoring architectures even more than in the case of W-CDMA and cdma2000 with carrier stealing.

Besides, certain high-performance jammer suppression techniques, e.g., linear MMSE suppression, assume that the powers and frequencies of the interfering signals are known, or that they can be adaptively estimated. The former is never true in practice and the latter is not feasible when long spreading codes are used. The present work eliminates these restrictions, by applying the idea of iterative MMSE multiuser interference suppression, introduced earlier by the authors, to this context. The first iteration in this procedure is effectively MMSE multiuser interference cancellation; the parameters of the jammers are unknown at this stage. The outputs of all users' soft decoders (applied to the demodulator outputs of this iteration) are then fed back to subtract their (estimated) cumulative contribution from the received signal vector; the residue comprises the narrowband jammers embedded in wideband noise, so that the former can be piecewise interpolated over chip intervals of appropriate duration, and thence subtracted from the received signal for the succeeding iteration. The soft-decoded feedback estimates of the interfering signals are also used in each iteration to perform soft MMSE multiuser interference suppression, in conjunction with subtractive interference cancellation. The approach is extended to exploit the enhanced separation (in the spatial sense) that is afforded by employing multisensor receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband jammer suppression in coded DS-CDMA channels","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

In every subband, the SIC receiver successively detects the interferers' signals and substracts them from the user-of-interest. A comparison is made among SIC, matched filter detection with an equal gain combiner (MF-EGC), matched filter followed by maximal-ratio combining (MF-MRC) and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers with optimal tap coefficients. For this latter receiver, we determine the performance both when the number of taps equals the processing gain, denoted by N, and when the number of taps is roughly one-half of the processing gain. By analysis and simulation, it is shown that the SIC has better ability to suppress multiple-access interference (MAI) than do MF and [N/2]-tap MMSE in single carrier (SC) CDMA, and MF-EGC, MF-MRC and [N/2]-tap MMSE in MC CDMA, and this translates to increased capacity and better fading resistance. Further, SIC and N-tap MMSE yield approximately the same performance in SC CDMA, but SIC has a poorer performance than does an N-tap MMSE in MC CDMA. In addition, we derive results for the performance degradation that a SIC scheme experiences in MC CDMA due to both phase and timing tracking errors. It is shown that with small tracking errors, SIC can still retain a performance advantage over MF-EGC and MF-MRC, although the advantage of SIC decreases with increasing tracking errors.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.821320","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The outage probability is an important performance measure for mobile communications, which is the probability that the signal to interference ratio (SIR) will be below a certain threshold. The performance improvement obtained by the antenna array is reduced due to correlation between array elements, therefore the correlated Rayleigh fading environment is considered in the whole analysis. The correlation between antennas is constituted as a function of angle of arrival, angle spread and antenna spacing. By proposing an approach, the conditional probability density function and the corresponding conditional outage probability of the SIR are derived for given covariance matrices. Here, the approximate unconditional outage probability is determined based on the previous derivation. Theoretical results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that there is a good match between the theory and the simulation.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.821341","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999. IEEE Military Communications.

This paper compares the feasibility of using a multiuser receiver based on selective parallel or successive interference cancellation technique with a single-user adaptive receiver in a peer-to-peer packet communication environment. The performance of an N-tap chip-rate linear adaptive receiver (CHRT-LAR) with normalized least-mean square algorithm (NLMS) is analyzed. For the single-user adaptive receiver, one user's spreading code and delay is known at the receiver, whereas the multiuser detector requires knowledge of the spreading codes and delays of all the users producing significant interference. To illustrate their potential for ad hoc networks, the BER performance and complexity of these two detection schemes are compared in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-user adaptive and multiuser receivers for DS-CDMA in peer-to-peer packet radio networks","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The performance of two different design strategies for MMSE detection is compared. In one case, the MMSE filters are designed separately for each carrier while in the other case the optimization of the filters is done jointly. Naturally, the joint optimization produces a better receiver, but the difference in performance is shown to be substantial. A mechanism is then developed to track the channel fading parameters for all the users' signals so that joint optimization of the receiver filters is possible in a time-varying channel. Simulation results show that the performance of this receiver is close to ideal theoretical results for moderate vehicle speeds, those for which the normalized Doppler rate is below one percent.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

For OFDM, diversity combining can be done on individual subcarriers (narrowband combining) or on the entire OFDM symbol (wideband combining). For narrowband combining, OFDM diversity performance in a frequency selective channel can be predicted using flat fading analytic formulas, given that sub-channels are sufficiently narrowband. For wideband combining, an equivalent channel model based on the number of rays in the channel is formulated and an analytic expression for wideband SC is derived. Computer simulation is used to verify these expressions and methods to improve the three combining techniques are discussed, including metric filtering, selection grouping, and higher order selection diversity.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

This requires a large amplifier power output backoff, when linear amplification is needed, resulting in low DC to RF power conversion efficiency of the amplifier. Previously, adaptive DC bias controlled amplifiers were proposed, which achieve both high power efficiency and linearity. In this paper, we quantify and optimise the power consumption of OFDM systems when the proposed amplifiers are used. The bit error rate (BER) and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) are obtained through computer simulation to help quantifying the amplifier nonlinear effects. It is found that power consumption can be greatly minimized by using adaptive amplifiers, especially with highly nonconstant envelope modulated signals such as OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The short time duration of these waveforms, typically nanoseconds, provides has an ultrawide bandpass characteristic, with a spectrum in the range of hundreds of megahertz, making them ideally suited for a spread spectrum communication system. The temporal representations of several monopulse signals are illustrated, and the power spectral densities of the Gaussian and Rayleigh monopulse waveshapes are presented. The relationship between effective time duration, peak-to-RMS value, and bandwidth is detailed. The spectral effect of pulse amplitude modulated data and pulse position modulated data is compared.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the bit error performance of IR using hard decision detection and soft decision detection techniques in an environment with dense multiple access interference and large near-far ratios, including severe interference from several local transmitters and a large number of distant interferers and thermal noise. The results show that hard decision detection performs better than soft decision detection in the presence of several large interferers. We discuss the tradeoffs between hard decision detection and soft decision detection, and we also compare the performance of hard decision detection and soft decision detection with blanking. In the soft decision detection with blanking scheme, the input signal is blanked during any interval when an interfering pulse overlaps the desired pulse. This blanking scheme requires knowledge of the time-hopping pattern of the interfering users and a corresponding increase in the complexity needed to achieve synchronization. Our analysis shows that the performance of the hard decision detection receiver is nearly equivalent to the performance of the soft decision detection receiver with blanking without an increase in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.821394","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The focus is on adaptive and recursive methods which exploit pilot symbols or pilot signals, resulting in algorithms which are alternatively appropriate for the uplink or the downlink. Moderate complexity, linear estimators and receivers are investigated which optimize the minimum-mean squared error or a weighted least-squares criterion, respectively. Different weight estimators are thus investigated. The proposed algorithms are explored via Monte Carlo simulations and are shown to be robust and offer near-optimal performance in certain scenarios. Fast convergence is also achieved. In addition, the channel estimation algorithms do not require coordination amongst the active users in terms of the transmission of pilots. Finally, the effects of mismatch in synchronization data are explored and methods to compensate for such errors are examined.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999. IEEE Military Communications.

This method suggests an optimization for code synchronization, which allows for TDOA (time difference of arrival) estimations to be solved for the position of a mobile phone. It is known that the time delay of a received DS signal, derived from the classical DLL, may express severe timing errors due to multipath effects. A new anti multipath multi-tracking extended Kalman filter loop is shown to achieve far better results especially in the environment of specular multipath. Specifically, this new loop minimizes the errors due to multipath components by letting the EKF decide upon the best weights of its sub-chip processing branches, resulting in a RAKE-like tracking loop. This loop tracks not only the line of sight path, but also the other multipath components as well as their power and phase. It is shown that the implementation of this technique converges to the classical non-coherent code tracking DLL structure when no multipath is assumed, but results in a new and efficient tracking loop structure in the more realistic fading channel case. The application of this technique to the EIA IS-95 system is considered, where accurate location estimations as well as power management utilities are treated.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.821419","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The adaptive transmission protocol allows the radios to adjust the power in the transmitted signal and the rate of a Reed-Solomon code to respond to variations in partial-band interference and propagation loss. Routing is accomplished using least-resistance routing (LRR) with a new metric that provides a quantitative assessment of the ability of a radio to receive and forward packets and includes a measure of the energy that is expected to be required for successful transmission. The new energy metric and LRR are integrated with the adaptive transmission protocol, and the performance of the new protocol suite is evaluated for a distributed FH network. The performance results presented in this paper are obtained from a simulation of wireless FH radio networks in which the characteristics of the links vary with time. The results demonstrate that in FH networks that employ an adaptive transmission protocol, the new method for routing can adapt quickly to changes in interference conditions. We find that LRR with the energy metric works with the adaptive transmission protocol to improve the information throughput and energy efficiency of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6566725","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient routing in frequency-hop networks with adaptive transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient routing in frequency-hop networks with adaptive transmission","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00821435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026213S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6639","citationCount":"14","articleId":"821435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":821438,"authors":[{"name":"Taek Jin Kwon","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Taek Jin Kwon","id":"37288103100"},{"name":"M.

The best systems detected old attacks included in the training data, at moderate detection rates ranging from 63% to 93% at a false alarm rate of 10 false alarms per day. Detection rates were much worse for new and novel R2L and DoS attacks included only in the test data. The best systems failed to detect roughly half these new attacks which included damaging access to root-level privileges by remote users. These results suggest that further research should focus on developing techniques to find new attacks instead of extending existing rule-based approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17794","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition.

For this domain we provide clear evidence that state-of-the-art commercial fraud detection systems can be substantially improved in stopping losses due to fraud by combining multiple models of fraudulent transaction shared among banks. We demonstrate that the traditional statistical metrics used to train and evaluate the performance of learning systems (ie. statistical accuracy or ROC analysis) are misleading and perhaps inappropriate for this application. Cost-based metrics are more relevant in certain domains, and defining such metrics poses significant and interesting research questions both in evaluating systems and alternative models, and in formalizing the problems to which one may wish to apply data mining technologies. This paper also demonstrates how the techniques developed for fraud detection can be generalized and applied to the important area of intrusion detection in networked information systems. We report the outcome of recent evaluations of our system applied to tcpdump network intrusion data specifically with respect to statistical accuracy. This work involved building additional components of JAM that we have come to call, MADAM ID (Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection). However, taking the next step to define cost-based models for intrusion detection poses interesting new research questions. We describe our initial ideas about how to evaluate intrusion detection systems using cost models learned during our work on fraud detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-based modeling for fraud and intrusion detection: results from the JAM project","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition.

First, the coefficients of the variable 2-D transfer function are represented by using the polynomials of a pair of fractional delays (p/sub 1/, p/sub 2/). Then the weighted squared-error function of the variable 2-D frequency response is derived without sampling the two frequencies (/spl omega//sub 1/, /spl omega//sub 2/) and two fractional delays (p/sub 1/, p/sub 2/), which leads to a significant reduction in computational complexity. With the assumption that the overall weighting function is separable and stepwise, the design problem is reduced to the minimization of the weighted squared-error function. Based on the error function, the closed-form optimal solutions for the coefficient matrices of the variable 2-D transfer function can be determined through solving a pair of matrix equations. In addition, Cholesky decomposition is applied to the final closed-form expressions in order to avoid some numerical instability problem. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17802/00821551.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.821551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.821551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted least-squares method for designing variable fractional delay 2-D FIR digital filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Delay","Two dimensional displays","Transfer functions","Matrix decomposition","Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Polynomials","Frequency response","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional digital filters","FIR filters","network synthesis","least squares approximations","delay filters","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted least squares method","design","variable fractional delay 2D FIR digital filter","transfer function","polynomial","Cholesky decomposition","error function","frequency response","matrix equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Weighted least-squares method for designing variable fractional delay 2-D FIR digital filters","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6527080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted least-squares method for designing variable fractional delay 2-D FIR digital filters","sourcePdf":"00821551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05617S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"51","articleId":"821551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":821563,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the SEA, the efficiency of reducing the number of ME operations mostly depends upon the appropriate selection of an initial motion vector for searching. We first propose the method of the initial motion vector selection for SEA.

The inherent robustness and high parallelism enable it to be suitable for VLSI implementation of video encoders.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.821566","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17788/00821566.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"69 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.821566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fast motion estimation method based on genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"A novel fast motion estimation method based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6511817","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fast motion estimation method based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Kobe","sourcePdf":"00821566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032506S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"13","articleId":"821566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":821570,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Hee Lee","id":"37067452900"},{"name":"Jae-Kyoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Kyoon Kim","id":"37281195700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5467-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"821570","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Motion compensation","Video coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Pattern matching","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Decoding","Bit rate","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","motion estimation","motion compensation","computational complexity","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast block motion estimation","overlapped motion compensation","selective pixel matching","blocking artifact problems","video coding","overlapped block motion estimation","pixel","computational complexity","multiplication","simulation","prediction performance"]}],"abstract":"Overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) has been studied as a partial solution to the blocking artifact problems of the conventional non-overlapped block motion compensation (BMC). OBMC has been shown to provide improved prediction efficiency as well as better subjective quality for coded video compared with BMC. Also, by employing motion estimation techniques optimized for OBMC, called overlapped block motion estimation (OBME), we can obtain further substantial gains in compensation accuracy over conventional nonoverlapped block motion estimation (BME). However, OBME is too complex for practical realization because multiplication is required for each pixel of every candidate block in matching computations. In this work an effective motion estimation method is presented which significantly reduces the computational complexity of OBME. The proposed method uses a predetermined pattern in selecting matched pixels within a window support to reduce the multiplications of OBME. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves about the same prediction performance as the conventional OBME.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast block motion estimation for overlapped motion compensation using selective pixel matching","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.821570","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17788/00821570.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"83 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.821570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17788","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Fast block motion estimation for overlapped motion compensation using selective pixel matching","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6511820","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast block motion estimation for overlapped motion compensation using selective pixel matching","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00821570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027607S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"821570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":821595,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper extends the wide-sense stationary theory of motion-compensated prediction (MCP) for hybrid video codecs to multihypothesis motion compensation. The power spectrum of the prediction error is related to the displacement error probability density functions (pdfs) of an arbitrary number of hypotheses in a closed-form expression. We then study the influence of motion compensation accuracy on the efficiency of multihypothesis motion compensation as well as the influence of the residual noise level and the gain from optimal combination of N hypotheses. For the noise-free limiting case, doubling the number of (equally good) hypotheses can yield a gain of up to 1/2 bits/sample, while doubling the accuracy of motion compensation can additionally reduce the bit-rate by up to 1 bit/sample independent of N. For realistic noise levels, it is shown that the introduction of B-frames or overlapped block motion compensation can provide larger gains than doubling motion compensation accuracy. Spatial filtering of the motion-compensated candidate signals becomes less important if more hypotheses are combined. The critical accuracy beyond which the gain due to more accurate motion compensation is small moves to larger displacement error variances with increasing noise and increasing number of hypotheses N. Hence, sub-pel accurate motion compensation becomes less important with multihypothesis MCP. The theoretical insights are confirmed by experimental results for overlapped block motion compensation, B-frames, and multiframe motion-compensated prediction with up to eight hypotheses from ten previous frames.","doi":"10.1109/83.821595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17803/00821595.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.821595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17803","startPage":"173","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency analysis of multihypothesis motion-compensated prediction for video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency analysis of multihypothesis motion-compensated prediction for video coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6527056","pubMedId":"18255384","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency analysis of multihypothesis motion-compensated prediction for video coding","sourcePdf":"00821595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051851S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"160","articleId":"821595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":821613,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

Furthermore, there is no loss in error correcting capability by using hierarchical FEC when maximum distance separable codes are used. Actual MBONE experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.821639","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17788/00821639.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"405 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.821639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error control for video multicast using hierarchical FEC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Error control for video multicast using hierarchical FEC","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6503920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error control for video multicast using hierarchical FEC","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00821639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046341S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"15","articleId":"821639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":821651,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The model is set up for indoor scenarios, although in principle it can be extended easily to urban environments. Deterministic ray-tracing results are used to produce the huge data sets required for the statistical evaluation of the parameters of the proposed model. The approach for the stochastic model is based on physical wave-propagation, where the channel is described by multipath components including angles of arrival at the receiver and angles of transmission at the transmitter. In each modeling step, path properties change according to the movement of the radio stations (RSs). The appearance and disappearance of multipath components is modeled by a genetic process. Especially, changing delay times of the propagation paths yield a realistic Doppler behavior of the channel. A new approach to model the directions of multipath components in three dimensions has been developed. By relating the angles of arrival (or transmission) to the direct line between transmitter and receiver, a universal modeling approach, which is independent of the actual geometry, becomes possible. The novel stochastic spatial channel model allows the simulation of complex systems including arbitrary antenna configurations and patterns. A detailed description of the overall model is presented together with some initial simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821698.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.821698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic spatial channel model based on wave-propagation modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Radio transmitters","Wideband","Spread spectrum communication","Ray tracing","Receivers","Genetics","Propagation delay","Solid modeling","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic processes","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","land mobile radio","indoor radio","direction-of-arrival estimation","Doppler effect","delays","antenna radiation patterns","digital radio","spread spectrum communication","broadband networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-band spread spectrum applications","wave-propagation modeling","stochastic spatial propagation channel model","indoor radio","urban environments","deterministic ray-tracing results","data sets","statistical evaluation","model parameters","multipath components","angles of arrival","receiver","angles of transmission","transmitter","radio station movement","genetic process","delay times","propagation paths","realistic Doppler behavior","universal modeling approach","systems simulation","antenna configurations","antenna patterns","digital wireless communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic spatial channel model based on wave-propagation modeling","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6500260","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic spatial channel model based on wave-propagation modeling","sourcePdf":"00821698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042136S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"83","articleId":"821698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":821706,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The new scheme is based on a combination of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion and the turbo processing principle by Hagenauer (see Proc. Int. Symp. Turbo Codes and Related Topics, Brest, France, p.1-9, 1997). The complexity of the new scheme is of polynomial order in the number of users. The new scheme is applicable to two situations: (a) when the receiver is capable of decoding the signals from all users and (b) when the receiver is only capable of decoding the signals from a subset of users. In the first scenario, we establish that the proposed receiver achieves superior performance to the iterative soft interference cancellation technique under certain conditions. On the other hand, in the second scenario, we argue that the proposed receiver outperforms both the iterative soft interference canceler and the iterative maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver because of its superior near-far resistance. For operation over fading channels, the estimation of the complex fading parameters for all users becomes an important ingredient in any multiuser detector. In our scheme, the soft information provided by the decoders is used to enhance this estimation process. Two iterative soft-input channel estimation algorithms are presented: the first is based on the MMSE criterion, and the second is a lower-complexity approximation of the first. The proposed multiuser detection algorithm(s) are suitable for both terrestrial and satellite applications of CDMA.","doi":"10.1109/49.821707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821707.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection for coded CDMA signals in AWGN and fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection for coded CDMA signals in AWGN and fading channels","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6500262","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative multiuser detection for coded CDMA signals in AWGN and fading channels","sourcePdf":"00821707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035925S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"134","articleId":"821707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":821712,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.C.

The conventional approaches may result in either nonuniform distribution of transmitting users among time slots or uneven interference from the dominant interferers. For both cases, the bit-error rate (BER) increases significantly for the users suffering the worst case condition. We propose an optimal time-hopping scheme based on the theory of finite projective planes for DS-CDMA to distribute interference evenly among participating users. The performance evaluation is divided into four parts. We demonstrate that both the average BER, probability of outage, and bandwidth efficiency can be improved by using the proposed time hopping scheme in comparison to other time-hopping schemes, such as the fixed allocation scheme and random selection scheme for various modulation methods including frequency shift keying-coherent demodulation (FSK-CD), differential phase shift keying (DPSK), binary phase shift keying (BPSK), and FSK with noncoherent demodulation (FSK-NCD). We compare the proposed time hopping scheme with nontime-hopping DS-CDMA with identical signal bandwidth. We then prove that the proposed scheme is optimal in minimizing interference.","doi":"10.1109/49.821716","startPage":"53","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821716","endPage":"61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal time-hopping scheme for CDMA air interface in broad-band wireless systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Optimal time-hopping scheme for CDMA air interface in broad-band wireless systems","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6500264","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal time-hopping scheme for CDMA air interface in broad-band wireless systems","sourcePdf":"00821716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069776S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","articleId":"821716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":821719,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.J.

The consideration is made mainly in one-path additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. A consideration to a fixed multipath channel is given to see its effect on the results. Also, a consideration for a certain type of fading is given in a case where the signal power is assumed to be considerably lower, i.e., faded, part of the time. For the possible performance measures of code acquisition, the main interest is in the mean acquisition time T/sub MA/. The probability of the acquisition in a given observation interval P/sub acq/ is also considered to see if different measures have different demands. A matched filter (MF) acquisition is used with and without a verification mode using an active integration. In the comparisons, fixed thresholds, thresholds based on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) criteria, and optimal thresholds in the sense to give either the minimum T/sub MA/ or the maximum P/sub acq/ are used. The results, which are obtained by using a method of selecting the maximum value at the output of the MF, are compared to the threshold cases. The results can be summarized as follows: when the performance measure is T/sub MA/, the best results are obtained by using CFAR-based threshold comparison. By a proper selection of the probability of a false alarm, the same performance is obtained as by using the optimal thresholds.

Therefore, a generalized joint linear timing and carrier-phase estimation scheme to effectively estimate both the received timings and carrier phases at the same time is of paramount interest. Based on the idea to linearly combine the sufficient statistics of timings and carrier phases, we introduce the generalized joint linear timing and carrier phase estimation scheme with commensurate complexity of the generalized linear timing estimator. To avoid the difficulty of the design by minimizing the mean-square error (MSE), a simple and novel design criterion for this generalized joint linear estimation is proposed. With a discrete timing assumption, we not only mathematically prove that the MSE of the proposed estimator converges to zero as noise vanishes for an arbitrary number of users, but also conduct simulations to verify it. On the other hand, for the general case with a continuous timing assumption, arguments and simulations are provided to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed estimator for an arbitrary number of users. We further show that such an efficient linear-complexity joint estimation scheme is effective in the near-far environment. Consequently, the nonpolynomial (NP) hard multiuser synchronization over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is successfully solved.","doi":"10.1109/49.821723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821723.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","startPage":"87","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint linear timing and carrier phase estimation of DS-CDMA multiuser communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint linear timing and carrier phase estimation of DS-CDMA multiuser communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6500267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint linear timing and carrier phase estimation of DS-CDMA multiuser communications","sourcePdf":"00821723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046888S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"821723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":821724,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37287470000"},{"name":"Chin-Feng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Feng Lin","id":"37366150200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"821724","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Land mobile radio","Bit rate","Throughput","Resource management","Next generation networking","Broadband communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multimedia communication","land mobile radio","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum multicode CDMA transport architecture","multimedia services","spread spectrum code division multiple access","SS-CDMA","next-generation wireless mobile networks","mobile radio channel","variable bit rate multimedia services","traffic load","time-varying throughput","MC-CDMA","spreading codes","transmission rates","cost-effective dynamic code allocation scheme","maximum resource utilization","MacroMind Director","performance"]}],"abstract":"We investigate a new application of the well-known spread spectrum code division multiple access (SS-CDMA) techniques to multimedia services related to the development of the next-generation wireless mobile networks interconnecting with a wireline ATM-based broadband network. Such services allow users to share novel multimedia applications without any geographical restrictions. However, since the mobile radio channel has a fixed limited bandwidth, the traditional SS-CDMA system may not be sufficient to accommodate the variable bit rate (VBR) multimedia services requested by multiple mobile users simultaneously. Moreover, the traffic load at the base station can change dynamically due to the time-varying throughput requirement of these requested multimedia services. To tackle this difficulty, a multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) technique is proposed to provide multirate multimedia services by varying the number of spreading codes assigned to each user in order to meet its throughput requirement. In MC-CDMA, a spreading code can be used to transmit information at a basic bit rate. Users (video or data) who need higher transmission rates can use multiple codes in parallel. Meanwhile, the maximum available number of codes in the MC-CDMA system is still limited. Hence, a cost-effective dynamic code allocation scheme has then been proposed to dynamically assign an appropriate number of codes to each user for achieving the maximum resource utilization for multiuser multimedia services via the mobile radio channel. Finally, a number of real multimedia titles generated from the well-known MacroMind Director are conducted to evaluate performance.","doi":"10.1109/49.821724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821724.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of spread spectrum multicode CDMA transport architecture for multimedia services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821724/","displayDocTitle":"Design of spread spectrum multicode CDMA transport architecture for multimedia services","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6500268","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of spread spectrum multicode CDMA transport architecture for multimedia services","sourcePdf":"00821724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055206S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","articleId":"821724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":821725,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The main feature of our proposed system is the utilization of two different fields in the analysis of the satellite multiple access problem. Since the hub now possesses the forward error correction (FEC) capability to correct errors that appear after the CDMA despreading of the packets, the satellite does not need to ask so often for the retransmission of erroneous packets and will ask for retransmission only when the FEC error correcting capability is exceeded. This paper also presents the adaptive optimization of the balance between the CDMA processing gain and FEC coding gain in order to obtain a better throughput for the SS-CDMA/ALOHA with hybrid ARQ protocol for satellite multiple access. The optimization is made with the constraint of keeping the bandwidth of the transmitted packets constant during all times. According to this, the effective throughput of the protocol (information bits over total transmitted bits ratio) is improved by adaptively changing the CDMA and FEC codes used in the transmission. This adaptive optimization is done by observing the channel status or load and increasing or decreasing both coding schemes' gains. Computer simulations show the performance of the proposed multiple access scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17810/00821726.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.821726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.821726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spread slotted CDMA/ALOHA system with hybrid ARQ for satellite multiple access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Automatic repeat request","Satellites","Forward error correction","Access protocols","Throughput","Bit error rate","Error correction","Error correction codes","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","automatic repeat request","forward error correction","access protocols","satellite communication","spread spectrum communication","packet radio networks","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread slotted CDMA/ALOHA system","hybrid ARQ","satellite multiple access protocol","spread slotted-ALOHA protocol","code division multiple access","hybrid automatic repeat request error controlling retransmission scheme","throughput","bit error rate","BER","forward error correction","adaptive optimization","CDMA processing gain","FEC coding gain","optimization","transmitted packets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A spread slotted CDMA/ALOHA system with hybrid ARQ for satellite multiple access","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6500270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spread slotted CDMA/ALOHA system with hybrid ARQ for satellite multiple access","sourcePdf":"00821726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","articleId":"821726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":821727,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

A lack of understanding of the constraints and the domain in which these equations are valid, often results in situations in which it is challenging to evaluate and compare results obtained by different investigators. Here, the authors reanalyzed the conditions for which Rush's equations were derived, and using mathematical modeling, computer simulation and in vitro measurements, they delineated areas of their appropriate application. The authors' studies showed that both sample geometry and test electrode configuration affect the measured tissue electrical resistivities: (1) The sample can be considered semi-infinite only if its dimensions are >50 inter-electrode separation distances (IESD), and thickness >2.5 IESD, (2) smaller sample sizes increase the transversally measured resistivity, (3) semi-infinite samples thinner than 2.5 IESD, and samples tested with needle electrodes demonstrate reduced anisotropy, and (4) when surface-spot electrodes are longitudinally aligned, as the IESD/tissue thickness ratio decreases, the measured resistivity increases. The authors' conclusion is that in most experimental situations, it is necessary to use modeling techniques to decouple the electrode configuration/sample geometry influence from the measured tissue resistivity.","doi":"10.1109/10.821749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.821749","startPage":"163","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17809/00821749.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of sample geometry and electrode configuration on measured electrical resistivity of skeletal muscle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Effects of sample geometry and electrode configuration on measured electrical resistivity of skeletal muscle","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6509347","pubMedId":"10721623","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821749/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of sample geometry and electrode configuration on measured electrical resistivity of skeletal muscle","sourcePdf":"00821749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03521S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","articleId":"821749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":821750,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This model is based on the modified method of characteristics (MMC). The characteristic functions are first approximated by applying lower order Taylor series in the frequency domain, and then a set of simple recursive formulas are obtained in the time domain. The formulas, which involve tracking performances between two ends of a transmission line, are similar to those derived by the method of characteristics for lossless and undistorted lossy transmission lines. The algorithm, based on the proposed MMC model, can efficiently evaluate transient responses of high-speed interconnects. It only uses the quantities at two ends of the lines, requiring less computation time and less memory space than required by other methods. Examples indicate that the new method has high accuracy and is very efficient for the time-domain simulation of interconnects in high-speed integrated circuits.","doi":"10.1109/22.821787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.821787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17804","startPage":"323","endPage":"327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17804/00821787.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821787","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Integrated circuit interconnections","Propagation losses","Transmission lines","Taylor series","Frequency domain analysis","Power system transients","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","High speed integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed integrated circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","transmission line theory","time-domain analysis","transient response","transient analysis","VLSI","multichip modules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain modeling","high-speed interconnects","modified method of characteristics","lossy transmission lines","time-domain simulation","characteristic functions approximation","lower order Taylor series","recursive formulas","transient responses","high-speed ICs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain modeling of high-speed interconnects by modified method of characteristics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6517026","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821787/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain modeling of high-speed interconnects by modified method of characteristics","sourcePdf":"00821787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032117S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","articleId":"821787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":821802,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Sheng Zhou","id":"37346041000"},{"name":"Lin-Ying Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Lin-Ying Lai","id":"37348606100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"821802","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design for fuzzy controllers by genetic algorithms","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17808/00821802.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.821802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17808","doi":"10.1109/28.821802","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Fuzzy control","Optimal control","Genetic algorithms","Nonlinear control systems","Industrial control","Control systems","Transfer functions","Automation","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process control","fuzzy control","control system synthesis","optimal control","genetic algorithms","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy optimal controller design","genetic algorithms","industrial processes","control rules","membership functions","trial and error","search algorithms","natural selection","natural genetics","multivariable optimization problems","control simulation","control performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821802","abstract":"Fuzzy control has been applied to various industrial processes; however, its control rules and membership functions are usually obtained by trial and error.

The internal combustion engine (ICE) is inappropriate for producing this torque-speed profile. Therefore, multiple gear transmission is necessary with the ICE in a vehicle. Some electric machines, if designed and controlled appropriately, are capable of producing an extended constant power range. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the capabilities of the switched reluctance motor (SRM) for electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle applications. This investigation is carried out in two steps. The first step involves the machine design and the finite-element analysis to obtain the static characteristic of the motor. In the second step, the finite-element field solutions are used in the development of a nonlinear model to investigate the dynamic performance of the designed motor.","doi":"10.1109/28.821805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17808/00821805.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.821805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17808","startPage":"111","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages of switched reluctance motor applications to EV and HEV: design and control issues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advantages of switched reluctance motor applications to EV and HEV: design and control issues","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advantages of switched reluctance motor applications to EV and HEV: design and control issues","sourcePdf":"00821805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030644S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"335","articleId":"821805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":821806,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, during steady state, notable torque, flux and current pulsations occur. They are reflected in speed estimation, speed response, and also in increased acoustical noise. This paper introduces a new direct torque and flux control based on space-vector modulation (DTC-SVM) for induction motor sensorless drives. It is able to reduce the acoustical noise, the torque, flux, current, and speed pulsations during steady state. The DTC transient merits are preserved, while better quality steady-state performance is produced in sensorless implementation for a wide speed range. The flux and torque estimator is presented and an improved voltage-current model speed observer is introduced. The proposed control topologies, simulations, implementation data, and test results with DTC and DTC-SVM are given and discussed. It is concluded that the proposed control topology produces better results for steady-state operation than the classical DTC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17808/00821806.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.821806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.821806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=821806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified direct torque control for induction motor sensorless drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction motors","Steady-state","Sensorless control","Topology","Noise robustness","Robust control","Noise reduction","Voltage","Observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine vector control","torque control","control system synthesis","machine theory","magnetic variables control","magnetic flux","parameter estimation","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor sensorless drive","modified direct torque control","control design","pulsations","speed estimation","speed response","acoustic noise","control simulation","space-vector modulation","steady-state performance","flux estimator","torque estimator","voltage-current model speed observer","control performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"A modified direct torque control for induction motor sensorless drive","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501388","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified direct torque control for induction motor sensorless drive","sourcePdf":"00821806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030664S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"381","articleId":"821806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":821807,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The converter has a unity input displacement power factor, and its input line current waveform is similar to that of a diode rectifier with a DC-link inductor.

This platform was applied to real-time piloted and unpiloted simulations of a helicopter UAV while testing the performance of an adaptive controller as well as the ability to reconfigure during a main rotor collective actuator failure. Results indicate that the chosen architecture can greatly increase the ability to integrate heterogeneous components in a seamless fashion into a collaborating set of resources that achieve the desired mission functionality.

The Interface Agent tries to understand the goal and intention of the operator based on the head motion and other inputs, the task context and current situation. When the need of the operator is identified, the Interface Agent invokes the services of other agents to satisfy the operator's desire. When the operator needs to watch for a number of concurrent activities, the Interface Agent coordinates the visualization agents to determine where on the display and what information should be presented to the operator.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.1999.821969","publicationTitle":"Gateway to the New Millennium. 18th Digital Avionics Systems Conference.

Limited downlink bandwidth and excessive round trip communication delays limit the capabilities and science value of missions which rely on terrestrial supercomputing resources. The difficulty encountered is that radiation-hardened components are both extremely expensive and lag several generations behind the commercial state of the art. The goal of the Remote Exploration and Experimentation (REE) project, part of NASA's HPCC program, is to migrate ground-based commercial supercomputing technology into space in a timely and cost-effective manner. Reaching this goal will enable new classes of science missions and make feasible the next major thrust in space exploration. The approach being taken on the REE project is to exploit a comprehensive architecture strategy to enable direct insertion of the prevailing generation of state of the art commercial (hardware/software) components in future space systems. The use of state of the art commercial hardware, coupled with a software-based fault tolerance strategy will allow high throughput computation even in the presence of relatively high rates of radiation-induced transient upsets as well as in the presence of permanent faults. The authors outline the overall project plan and status, and review the architecture of the First Generation Testbed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/821991/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6582284","conferenceDate":"24-29 Oct. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"REE: a COTS-based fault tolerant parallel processing supercomputer for spacecraft onboard scientific data analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REE: a COTS-based fault tolerant parallel processing supercomputer for spacecraft onboard scientific data analysis","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00821991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059209S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6600","citationCount":"8","articleId":"821991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":822084,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Further automation and implementation independence can be achieved by generating test vectors directly from the executable specification.

The proposed system consists of two sets of a PV array and buck-boost type chopper circuit. However, it is afraid that the system has lower \"using rate\" of PV energy than that of the ordinary PV system, as each PV array is only operated in the half duration of the AC power frequency. In this paper, it is also discussed how to increase this \"using rate\" by varying the connected capacitor between PV array terminals. The perturbation and observation method is adapted to the maximum power tracking in our PV systems. We adopt the wavelet transform to detect a power outage. The experimental data shows that this new inverter can supply AC power to the utility grid line with the power factor nearly unity.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.822194","publicationTitle":"IECON'99.

Thus, the approach avoids the hassle of (a) positioning the shorting pulses, and (b) defining and solving a set of nonlinear equations dedicated to CSR/Is. Moreover, the approach can eliminate an even or odd arbitrary number of harmonics (e.g., fundamental current control and elimination of the 5th, 7th, and 11th harmonics).

The decoupling of these two frequencies allows the optimal sampling ratio for closed-loop control purposes to be maintained, while the randomly varying switching ratio results in the transfer of harmonic power of the inverter output voltage into the continuous power density. This mitigates the undesirable acoustic, vibration, and EMI phenomena associated with fixed-frequency switching. A novel, so-called harmonic spread factor is introduced for quality evaluation of voltage spectra of inverters with random PWM. Practical realization of the modulator using the TMS320F240 DSP controller is described, and the results of simulations and experiments are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1999.822221","publicationTitle":"IECON'99.

This system consists of the DC converter that generates the single phase absolute value of sinusoidal current and a square wave voltage inverter which synchronizes with the AC power source. This DC converter consists of two switching devices and a capacitor for a nondissipative snubber circuit. The DC converter is applied to a pulse width modulation to obtain absolute value of sinusoidal current. It is not necessary to set the dead time of the switching devices in generating waveforms. Therefore, we can regard the dead time effects as small. The inverter is switched by the AC power source frequency so the line noise of voltage and current caused by the high frequency switching is very small. In this paper, it is confirmed by simulation that the proposed inverter for a new photovoltaic system has stable operation and good output characteristics are obtained by the experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-3 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514699","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single phase amplitude modulation inverter for utility interaction photovoltaic system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single phase amplitude modulation inverter for utility interaction photovoltaic system","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00822228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038207S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6620","citationCount":"15","articleId":"822228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":822249,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A novel approach based on the fusion of genetic algorithms and fuzzy inference for the automation of VLSI floorplanning design is proposed. The fuzzy rules are used to infer the initial position of the on-chip blocks based on analysis of the accumulated knowledge of the expert design engineer. Only the dominant combinations of place and block are inferred. Blocks deemed suitable candidates for placement at the center, relative to the four-corners of the chip, are inferred. These inferences are then reflected in the initial population of the genetic algorithms. The rest of the block placement phase is entrusted to the genetic algorithms. Experimental software to implement the proposed approach was developed. This was in turn used to perform computer-based experiments. The results of the experiments showed a level and quality of placement close to that of the expert design engineer.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.822249","startPage":"502","endPage":"508 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON'99.

On all large area structures (silicided area >100 /spl mu/m/sub 2/) our findings were consistent with the well-known narrow line width effect; i.e., the kinetics of transformation were adversely affected as the line width decreased, but with a sufficiently high thermal budget complete transformation to the C54 phase was possible. However, on structures with silicided area less than 100 /spl mu/m/sub 2/, a small area effect was observed in addition to the narrow line width effect. A percentage of small area lines remained entirely in the C49 phase (because of an apparent absence of C/sub 54/ nucleation sites) regardless of the thermal budget. This percentage increased with decreasing silicided area but was independent of the line width. Only the small area lines that did transform to the C54 phase exhibited the narrow line width effect. Therefore, for the range of line widths studied, the narrow line width mechanism and the small area mechanism were distinct.","doi":"10.1109/16.822274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.822274","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/17819/00822274.pdf","startPage":"313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small area versus narrow line width effects on the C49 to C54 transformation of TiSi/sub 2/","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822274/","displayDocTitle":"Small area versus narrow line width effects on the C49 to C54 transformation of TiSi/sub 2/","volume":"47","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6509318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small area versus narrow line width effects on the C49 to C54 transformation of TiSi/sub 2/","sourcePdf":"00822274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03283S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"822274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":822279,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Lin Chu","affiliation":["Advanced Semiconductor Device Research Laboratory and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Lin Chu","id":"37349864200"},{"name":"Da-Wen Lin","affiliation":["Advanced Semiconductor Device Research Laboratory and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Da-Wen Lin","id":"37305996800"},{"name":"Ching-Yuan Wu","affiliation":["Advanced Semiconductor Device Research Laboratory and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yuan Wu","id":"37334386500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"822279","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interface phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interface states","electron traps","MOSFET","hot carriers","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge-pumping technique","interface-state profiling","oxide-trapped charges","MOSFETs","hot-carrier induced local damage","gate pulse","lateral distribution","extraction methods","hot-carrier stress"]}],"abstract":"A new charge-pumping method has been developed to characterize the hot-carrier induced local damage.

The VZT architecture is regular and modular and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The output of the architecture is a data stream containing the virtual map, significance map and successive-approximation quantization symbols of the VZT algorithm. The approach is based on an efficient scheme to determine ancestor-descendant relationships in the wavelet coefficient data stream by rearrangement of the data stream for simpler VLSI implementation. The approach uses the sign-magnitude binary representation of the rearranged wavelet coefficients to form a single bit data stream as the input into the architecture. The coding and quantization for the VZT algorithm are formulated in view of the single bit data stream input and the corresponding VLSI architecture to implement the formulated requirements is presented.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1999.822318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.1999.822318","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

In this paper, a new DA architecture called NEDA is proposed aimed at reducing the cost metrics of power and area while maintaining high speed and accuracy in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. Mathematical analysis proves that NEDA can implement inner product of vectors in the form of 2's complement numbers using only additions, followed by a small number of shifts at the final stage. Comparative study shows that NEDA outperforms widely-used approaches such as MAC and DA in many aspects. Being a high speed architecture free of ROM, multiplication and subtraction, NEDA can also expose the redundancy existing in the adder array consisting of entries of 0 and 1. A hardware compression scheme is introduced to generate a butterfly structure with minimum number of additions. NEDA-based architecture for one dimensional DCT core is presented as an example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEDA: a new distributed arithmetic architecture and its application to one dimensional discrete cosine transform","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

The architecture offers efficient hardware utilization by combining the linear phase property of biorthogonal filters with decimation in a MAC based implementation. The design has been captured in VHDL and parameterised in terms of wavelet type, data word length and coefficient word length. The control circuit is embedded within the cores and allows them to be cascaded without any interface glue logic for any desired level of decomposition. The design time to produce silicon layout of a biorthogonal wavelet based system is typically less than a day. The resulting silicon cores produced are comparable in area and performance to hand-crafted designs. The designs are portable across a range of foundries and are also applicable to FPGA and PLD implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems. SiPS 99.

We adopted a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) structure to combat the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) induced during high speed data communication. The equalizer consists mainly of eight transversal adaptive filters and slicers. Since the adaptive filter along with the slicer will form a nonlinear feedback path, the resultant recursive computing often leads to a severe performance bottleneck. To overcome this, a bit serial, MSB first computing scheme based on distributed arithmetic and signed digit number system techniques was developed. In our scheme, the next symbol's equalization can be started as soon as the MSD of the current symbol is obtained. This leads to a computation overlap between successive symbol's equalization and can effectively improve the baud rate. The circuit complexity, however, is still kept low with the help of fine grain pipelining. With careful arrangement of data flow, an efficient systolic array design with 100% utilization and suitable for VLSI implementation is derived. The design architecture is also scalable in that the initiation interval between the processing of two consecutive symbols is a constant of 5+[m/4] clocks (in the delayed sign LMS case) and the hardware complexity is of order 2/spl middot/m/spl middot/(n+1), where m and n are tap order and word length.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

The developed scheme is an adaptive nonlinear predictor that consists of an (N+1)-level quantizer, an adaptive linear filter, and three adders, where N is the number of users in the CDMA system. It could be regarded as an enhancement to the nonlinear offset predictor presented by (Wang et al., 1997) with a more appropriate offset compensation scheme being derived and employed here. Computer simulation results support that this modified offset predictor performs much better than the original one with only a slight increase in complexity. As compared to the nearly optimal approximate conditional mean filter, it achieves almost the same performance even at very low signal-to-noise ratio, but involves much less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1999.822366","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

A six-transistor CMOS XOR circuit that also produces a complementary XNOR output is introduced in the general full adder. The resulting full adder circuit is realized using only 14 MOSFETs, while having full voltage-swing in all circuit nodes. Layouts have been made in a 0.35 /spl mu/m process for both the proposed full adder circuit and another 16-transistor full adder circuit based on pass transistors. The performance of the proposed full adder is evaluated by comparison of the simulation results obtained from HSPICE for both layouts. The two adders yield similar performance in terms of power consumption, power delay product, and propagation delay. The area is somewhat lower for the proposed adder due to the reduced device count. However, due to two feedback MOSFETs in the proposed adder that need to be ratioed, there is a higher cost in terms of design effort for the proposed adder.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Thus, an examination of the sign of the angle or y-remainder after each iteration is no longer required. By using Most-Significant Digit (MSD) first adder/multiplier, the critical path of the entire CORDIC architecture only requires (1.5 n+2) and (1.5 n+10) full-adders (n corresponds to the word-length of the inputs) for rotation and vectoring modes, respectively. This is a speed improvement of about 30% compared to the previously fastest reported shared rotation and vectoring mode implementations. Additionally, there is a higher degree of freedom in choosing the pipeline cutsets due to the novel independence of iteration i and i-1 in the CORDIC rotation. Optional pipelining can lead for example to an on-line delay of three clock-cycles where every clock cycles corresponds to a delay of twelve full-adders.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Delay","Signal processing algorithms","Application software","Computer architecture","Pipeline processing","Clocks","Vectors","Image processing","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","signal processing","adders","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed CORDIC algorithm","DSP applications","vectoring mode","circular coordinate systems","micro-rotations","constant scale factor","adder/multiplier","vectoring mode implementations","full-adders"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822381","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.1999.822381","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

One of the problems is that optimum input locations, which are calculated deterministically, sometimes distribute densely around the same point and cause local minima in backpropagation training. Two probabilistic active learning methods, which utilize the statistical variance of locations, are proposed to solve this problem. One is parametric active learning and the other is multipoint-search active learning. Another serious problem in applying active learning to multilayer perceptrons is that a Fisher information matrix can be singular, while many methods, including the proposed ones, assume its regularity. A technique of pruning redundant hidden units is proposed to keep the Fisher information matrix regular. Combined with this technique, active learning can be applied stably to multilayer perceptrons. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through computer simulations on simple artificial problems and a real-world problem of color conversion.","doi":"10.1109/72.822506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.822506","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17821/00822506.pdf","startPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical active learning in multilayer perceptrons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822506/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical active learning in multilayer perceptrons","volume":"11","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6518381","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18249735","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical active learning in multilayer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00822506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042956S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"59","articleId":"822506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":822508,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We show that the design of such nonadaptive indirect control systems necessitates only the training of the inverse of the model deprived from its delay, and that the presence of the delay thus does not increase the order of the inverse. The controller is then obtained by cascading this inverse with a rallying model which imposes the regulation dynamic behavior and ensures the robustness of the stability. A change in the desired regulation dynamic behavior, or an improvement of the stability, can be obtained by simply tuning the rallying model, without retraining the whole model reference controller. The robustness properties of internal model control systems being obtained when the inverse is perfect, we detail the precautions which must be taken for the training of the inverse so that it is accurate in the whole space visited during operation with the process. In the same spirit, we make an emphasis on neural models affine in the control input, whose perfect inverse is derived without training. The control of simulated processes illustrates the proposed design procedure and the properties of the neural internal model control system for processes without and with delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6518387","pubMedId":"18249741","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear internal model control using neural networks: application to processes with delay and design issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear internal model control using neural networks: application to processes with delay and design issues","sourcePdf":"00822512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058246S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"99","articleId":"822512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":822513,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The method is based on a new control law that is developed for any discrete deterministic time-invariant nonlinear dynamic system in a subregion /spl Psi//sub x/, of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the plant. The performance of the control law is not necessarily dependent on the distance between the current state of the plant and the equilibrium state if the nonlinear dynamic system satisfies some mild requirements in /spl Psi//sub x/. The control law is simple to implement and is based on a novel linearization of the input-output model of the plant at each instant in time. It can be used to control both minimum phase and nonminimum phase nonaffine nonlinear plants. Extensive empirical studies have confirmed that the control law can be used to control a relatively general class of highly nonlinear multiinput-multioutput (MIMO) plants.","doi":"10.1109/72.822514","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"102","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17821/00822514.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.822514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for the control of discrete nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Multi-layer neural network","Design methodology","MIMO","Gradient methods","NASA","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","neural nets","MIMO systems","controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete nonlinear dynamic systems","neural networks","controller design method","discrete deterministic time-invariant nonlinear dynamic system","asymptotically stable equilibrium point","input-output model","highly nonlinear multiinput-multioutput plants"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A new method for the control of discrete nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6518389","pubMedId":"18249743","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822514/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for the control of discrete nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00822514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043104S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"57","articleId":"822514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":822515,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

Specifically, two-layer feedforward neural networks are designed to approximate the functional relationship between the component/spacecraft design changes and measures of its performance or nonlinear dynamics of the system/components. A training algorithm, based on statistical sampling theory is presented, which guarantees that the trained networks provide a designer-specified degree of accuracy in mapping the functional relationship. Within each iteration of this statistical-based algorithm, a sequential design algorithm is used for the design and training of the feedforward network to provide rapid convergence to the network goals. Here, at each sequence a new network is trained to minimize the error of previous network. The proposed method should work for applications wherein an arbitrary large source of training data can be generated.

This paper focuses on spatial variation of the regularization parameter. We first show that the previously proposed neural-network method based on gradient descent can only find suboptimal solutions, and then introduce a regional processing approach based on local statistics. A method is presented to vary the regularization parameter spatially. This method is applied to a number of images degraded by various levels of noise, and the results are examined. The method is also applied to an image degraded by spatially variant blur.

In this paper, we present automatic target detection results for standard shared-weight neural networks trained with and without the added entropy term.","doi":"10.1109/72.822520","startPage":"186","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.822520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17821/00822520.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic target detection using entropy optimized shared-weight neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822520/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic target detection using entropy optimized shared-weight neural networks","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6518395","pubMedId":"18249749","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic target detection using entropy optimized shared-weight neural networks","sourcePdf":"00822520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067957S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"34","articleId":"822520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":822521,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ju-Ferr Yang","id":"37087517435"},{"name":"Chi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Tamsui Oxford University College, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Ming Chen","id":"37087195905"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"822521","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Convergence","Acceleration","Analytical models","Pattern matching","Sorting","Neurofeedback","Councils","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","performance evaluation","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winner-take-all neural network","mutual inhibition","competitive neurons","highest-threshold neural network","convergence","general mean-based neural network"]}],"abstract":"We propose a fast winner-take-all (WTA) neural network by dynamically accelerating the mutual inhibition among competitive neurons.

This paper reports first attempts to predict the dependence of P on several parameters of core design by means of artificial neural networks (ANN's). Investigations of several ANN versions showed good results for simple backpropagation networks equipped with several output neurons for an adaptive version of Gaussian coarse coding. A main problem arises from the fact that an increase of input parameters is linked with a large increase in training batches established by time-consuming model core experiments. As a compromise, first ANN's were trained for the prediction of the losses P/sub J/ of \"linearized\" joint regions as a function of the most relevant parameters, including the number of overlap steps and the mean air-gap length of joints. This yields rough estimations of the joint's contribution to the building factor for small cores. For larger cores, an ANN cascade structure was tested. It includes a second ANN that considers indirect effect of joint designs on the global distribution of losses. The major problem with an ANN-based prediction system is establishing representative training data. Modified versions of the ANN method can be applied to various tasks, including the prediction of losses and noises of full-sized cores.","doi":"10.1109/20.822542","startPage":"313","endPage":"329","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17822/00822542.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.822542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for the prediction of magnetic transformer core characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Transformer cores","Artificial neural networks","Magnetic cores","Performance loss","Power transformers","Magnetic analysis","Performance analysis","Backpropagation","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformer cores","neural nets","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformer","magnetic core","no-load loss","artificial neural network","backpropagation training","adaptive Gaussian coarse coding","building factor","ANN cascade structure","joint design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for the prediction of magnetic transformer core characteristics","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6517075","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for the prediction of magnetic transformer core characteristics","sourcePdf":"00822542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039764S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"822542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":822543,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The model is general and includes iron saturation, displacements of the rotor from its center location, and arbitrary angular rotor positions. The force between an individual stator pole and its corresponding rotor pole is calculated. The model is used to calculate the unbalanced magnetic forces on the SRM rotor, due to the rotor being displaced from its center location, by calculating the difference in the radial magnetic forces on opposite stator poles. The calculation of the unbalanced magnetic rotor forces requires an especially accurate model for the radial magnetic forces since the unbalanced forces are the difference between the two large radial forces on opposite sides of the rotor. The side pull created by the unbalanced forces will stress the bearings of the motor. The detailed analytical model presented here will simplify the bearing system design and will be especially useful if less stiff magnetic bearings are being employed. Finite-element analysis is used to validate the detailed analytical model. This same model for calculating the radial magnetic forces can be used as the input to a calculation of stator yoke ovulation due to radial magnetic forces and of the resulting acoustical noise production.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbalanced force calculation in switched-reluctance machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.822543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17822/00822543.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.822543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Unbalanced force calculation in switched-reluctance machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6517076","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbalanced force calculation in switched-reluctance machines","sourcePdf":"00822543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034339S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"78","articleId":"822543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":822544,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ming Cheng","id":"37272480000"},{"name":"K.T.

Caches typically are implemented with static RAM cells and often occupy a large portion of the chip area. Not surprisingly, these caches can consume a significant amount of power. In many applications, such as portable devices, energy efficiency is more important than performance. We propose sacrificing some performance in exchange for energy efficiency by filtering cache references through an unusually small first level cache. We refer to this structure as the filter cache. A second level cache, similar in size and structure to a conventional first level cache, is positioned behind the filter cache and serves to mitigate the performance loss. Extensive experiments indicate that a small filter cache still can achieve a high hit rate and good performance. This approach allows the second level cache to be in a low power mode most of the time, thus resulting in power savings. The filter cache is particularly attractive in low power applications, such as the embedded processors used for communication and multimedia applications. For example, experimental results across a wide range of embedded applications show that a direct mapped 255-byte filter cache achieves a 58 percent power reduction while reducing performance by 21 percent. This trade-off results in a 51 percent reduction in the energy-delay product when compared to a conventional design.","doi":"10.1109/12.822560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17823/00822560.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.822560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtering memory references to increase energy efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Filtering memory references to increase energy efficiency","volume":"49","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6509360","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822560/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtering memory references to increase energy efficiency","sourcePdf":"00822560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048104S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"58","articleId":"822560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":822561,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By exploiting the inherent parallelism in the application, these architectures can maximize pipelining. The key consideration involved with the design of a data driven ASIC is ensuring that throughput is maximized while a relatively low area is maintained. Optimal throughput can be realized by ensuring that all operands arrive simultaneously at their corresponding operator node. If this condition is achieved, the underlying data flow graph is said to be balanced. If the initial data flow graph is unbalanced, buffers must be inserted to prevent the clogging of the pipeline along the shorter paths. A novel algorithm for the assignment of buffers in a data flow graph is proposed. The method can also be applied to achieve wave-pipelining in digital systems under certain restrictions. The algorithm uses a new application of the retiming technique; the number of buffers here is shown to be equal to the minimum number of buffers achieved by integer programming techniques. We also discuss an extension of this algorithm which can further reduce the number of buffers by altering the DFG without affecting functionality or performance. The time complexities of the proposed algorithms are O(V/spl times/E) and O(V/sup 2//spl times/logV), respectively, a considerable improvement over the existing strategies. Also proposed is a novel buffer distribution algorithm that exploits a unique feature of data driven operation. This procedure maximizes throughput by inserting substantially fewer buffers than other techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6509361","volume":"49","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Buffer assignment algorithms on data driven ASICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer assignment algorithms on data driven ASICs","sourcePdf":"00822561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05341S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","articleId":"822561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":822562,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The packet forwarding format and the proposed algorithms constitute a new paradigm for handling data hazards in deeply pipelined floating-point pipelines. The addition and rounding algorithms employ a four stage execution phase pipeline with each stage suitable for implementation in a short clock period, assuming about 15 logic levels per cycle. The first two cycles are related to addition proper and are the focus of this paper. The last two cycles perform the rounding and have been covered in a paper by D.W. Matula and A.M. Nielsen (1997). The addition algorithm accepts one operand in a standard binary floating-point formal at the start of cycle one. The second operand is represented in the packet forwarding floating-point format: namely, it is divided into four parts: the sign bit, the exponent string, the principal part of the significant, and the carry-round packet. The first three parts of the second operand are input at the start of cycle one and the carry-round packet is input at the start of cycle two. The result is output in two formats that both represent the rounded result as required by the IEEE 754 standard. The result is output in the packet forwarding floating-point format at the end of cycles two and three to allow forwarding with an effective latency of two cycles. The result is also format at the end of cycle four for retirement to a register. The packet forwarding result is thus available with an effective two cycle latency for forwarding to the start of the adder pipeline or to a cooperating multiplier pipeline accepting a packet forwarding operand. The effective latency of the proposed design is two cycles for successive dependent operations while perceiving IEEE 754 binary floating-point compatibility.","doi":"10.1109/12.822562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17823/00822562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.822562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17823","startPage":"33","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IEEE compliant floating-point adder that conforms with the pipeline packet-forwarding paradigm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An IEEE compliant floating-point adder that conforms with the pipeline packet-forwarding paradigm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6509367","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IEEE compliant floating-point adder that conforms with the pipeline packet-forwarding paradigm","sourcePdf":"00822562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038478S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"822562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":822563,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Kang Huang","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wei Kang Huang","id":"37345823800"},{"name":"F.J.

The proposed AND/OR approach was found to reduce the number of FPGA reprogrammings needed for testing by up to a factor of seven versus direct methods of multiple faulty block detection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Logic testing","Wires","Routing","Test pattern generators","Electrical fault detection","Fault tolerance","Programmable logic arrays","Programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","programmable logic devices","fault tolerant computing","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple faulty FPGA logic blocks detection","configuration memories","AND tree","OR tree-based testing","constant testability","Xilinx XC3000","XC4000","XC5200","multiple faulty block detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822563","doi":"10.1109/12.822563","startPage":"48","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17823/00822563.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.822563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822563/","displayDocTitle":"An approach for detecting multiple faulty FPGA logic blocks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6509362","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach for detecting multiple faulty FPGA logic blocks","sourcePdf":"00822563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040747S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"15","articleId":"822563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":822571,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Comparing the proposed circuit to existing passive snubber circuits, it is simpler than the conventional energy recovery passive snubber, which has the drawbacks of too many parts, difficult circuit layout, and high stray inductance. As a result, the unwanted high frequency current and voltage ringing at switching transitions of the boost switch are reduced, which significantly reduces the voltage stress on boost devices and mitigates EMI noise problem. Moreover, the proposed circuit overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional resonant nondissipative snubber, which usually does not have turn-on current snubbing for the boost diode and has a very narrow soft switching operating range with extremely high peak voltage stress on boost devices. The proposed circuit not only serves as an energy recovery turn-on snubber, which greatly reduces the reverse-recovery peak current of the power boost diode and the turn-on loss of the boost switch, but also provides a zero-voltage or reduced voltage turn-off condition for the boost switch with extended operating range. Since it uses fewer circuit components, the circuit layout is simpler. It has less current ringing problem, which helps to reduce the EMI generated. The presented circuit is especially suited for high power boost converter applications. In this paper, the circuit operation, the analysis, and comparisons with other snubber circuits are provided. The simulation results based on a 3 kW telecom rectifier are shown. The experimental results showing energy recovery soft-switching turn-off and turn-on features with clamped peak switch voltages are also included.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2000.822581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.2000.822581","startPage":"699","endPage":"706 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

By using this new topology the need for high damping resistance and low RLC cut-off frequency is eliminated. This reduces the phase shift in the current regulation loop and increases the filter efficiency. Experimental verification of the filter topology is provided with a 480 V inverter and a 25 HP permanent magnet synchronous motor.

Existing approaches rely on two forms of symbolic-expression representation: expanded sum-of-product form and arbitrarily nested form. Expanded form suffers the problem that the number of product terms grows exponentially with the size of a circuit. Nested form is neither canonical nor amenable to symbolic manipulation. In this paper, we present a new approach to exact and canonical symbolic analysis by exploiting the sparsity and sharing of product terms. It consists of representing the symbolic determinant of a circuit matrix by a graph-called a determinant decision diagram (DDD)-and performing symbolic analysis by graph manipulations. We show that DDD construction, as well as many symbolic analysis algorithms, takes time almost linear in the number of DDD vertices. We describe an efficient DDD-vertex ordering heuristic and prove that it is optimum for ladder-structured circuits. For practical analog circuits, the numbers of DDD vertices are several orders of magnitude less than the numbers of product terms. The algorithms have been implemented and compared respectively to symbolic analyzers ISAAC and Maple-V in generating the expanded sum-of-product expressions, and SCAPP in generating the nested sequences of expressions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17820/00822616.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.822616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.822616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Canonical symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Circuit simulation","Numerical simulation","Algorithm design and analysis","Circuit analysis","Frequency","Performance analysis","Data structures","Boolean functions","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","network synthesis","symbol manipulation","determinants","binary decision diagrams","ladder networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["canonical symbolic analysis algorithm","analog circuit design","determinant decision diagram","symbolic matrix determinant","zero suppressed binary decision diagram","graph","ladder circuit","vertex ordering heuristic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Canonical symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6523428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","sourcePdf":"00822616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07401S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"97","articleId":"822616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":822617,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The framework contains two phases: choosing the resource configuration, and determining a module binding for each resource. We introduce a powerful model called an acceptability function which models design objectives, based on tradeoffs among different design constraints as well as a user's willingness to accept a design. Module utility measure cooperating with inclusion scheduling is the key to the success of our method. The utility of a module reflects the usefulness of the module based on the acceptability function. Inclusion scheduling is an algorithm to provide information for determining the number of functional units as well as module usefulness. We also present a heuristic which modifies module utility values based on the given acceptability function until they lead to superior selections. Many experiments on well-known benchmarks show the effectiveness of the approach when the obtained module selections are compared with the results from enumerating all module selections, as well as other schemes such as MSSR and PSGA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6523429","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient design exploration based on module utility selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design exploration based on module utility selection","sourcePdf":"00822617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030248S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","articleId":"822617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":822618,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Embedded arrays provide high-density high-speed implementations of the storage parts of circuits, Unfortunately, they require the FPGA vendor to partition the device into memory and logic resources at manufacture-time. This leads to a waste of chip area for customers that do not use all of the storage provided. This chip area need not be wasted, and can in fact be used very efficiently, if the arrays are configured as multioutput ROMs, and used to implement logic, In this paper, we describe two versions of a new technology mapping algorithm that identifies parts of circuits that can be efficiently mapped to an embedded array and performs this mapping, The first version of the algorithm places no constraints on the depth of the final circuit; on a set of 29 sequential and combinational benchmarks, the tool is able to map, on average, 59.7 4-LUTs into a single 2-Kbit memory array, while increasing the critical path by 7%, The second version of the algorithm places a constraint on the depth of the final circuit; it maps, on average, 56.7 4-LUTs into the same memory array, while increasing the critical path by only 2.3%. This paper also considers the effect of the memory array architecture on the ability of the algorithm to pack logic into memory, It is shown that the algorithm performs best when each array has between 512 and 2048 bits, and has a word width that can be configured as 1, 2, 4, or 8.","doi":"10.1109/43.822620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.822620","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17820/00822620.pdf","startPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous technology mapping for area reduction in FPGAs with embedded memory arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822620/","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous technology mapping for area reduction in FPGAs with embedded memory arrays","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6523432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous technology mapping for area reduction in FPGAs with embedded memory arrays","sourcePdf":"00822620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07548S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","articleId":"822620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":822626,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Rong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"lastName":"Zheng Rong Yang","id":"37087363614"},{"name":"M.

The problem is made more difficult when parametric variations are taken into account. Hence, statistical methods and techniques such as neural networks have been employed to automate classification. The major drawback to such techniques has been the implicit assumption that the variances of the responses of faulty circuits have been the same as each other and the same as that of the fault-free circuit. This assumption can be shown to be false. Neural networks, moreover, have proved to be slow. This paper describes a new neural network structure that clusters responses assuming different means and variances. Sophisticated statistical techniques are employed to handle situations where the variance tends to zero, such as happens with a fault that causes a response to be stuck at a supply rail. Two example circuits are used to show that this technique is significantly more accurate than other classification methods. A set of responses can be classified in the order of 1 s.","doi":"10.1109/43.822626","startPage":"142","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17820/00822626.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.822626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying a robust heteroscedastic probabilistic neural network to analog fault detection and classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Neural networks","Fault detection","Circuit faults","Electrical fault detection","Circuit testing","Statistical analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Analog integrated circuits","Rails"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","neural nets","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust heteroscedastic probabilistic neural network","fault detection","fault classification","analog integrated circuit","statistical technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Applying a robust heteroscedastic probabilistic neural network to analog fault detection and classification","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6523438","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying a robust heteroscedastic probabilistic neural network to analog fault detection and classification","sourcePdf":"00822626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063976S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"34","articleId":"822626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":822645,"authors":[{"name":"M.Z.

After turbo encoding, a subset of the parity symbols is punctured and replaced with known pilot symbols. Because the pilot symbols replace existing parity symbols, no bandwidth expansion is required. However, there is a restriction on the set of possible pilot symbol spacings and interleaver sizes. At the receiver, estimates of the complex channel gain and variance of the additive noise are first computed by filtering observations of the pilot symbols. As the turbo decoder performs its iterations, the channel estimates are refined by using information produced by the decoder. The performance of the proposed technique is assessed by computer simulation, and compared for two normalized fade rates with both perfect coherent detection (corresponding to perfect knowledge of the fading process and noise variance) and differential detection of differentially-encoded binary phase shift keying (DPSK).","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822647","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The approach is based on the unconventional self-encoding principles that we have developed at the University of Nebraska for the modulation and detection of spread spectrum signals. The proposed system does not use pseudo-random codes, and is unique in that traditional transmit and receive code generators based on maximal-length sequences or chaotic signals are not needed. In fact, the enhanced transmission security arises not only due to the spread-spectrum nature of the signal, but also from the true randomness of the unique spectrum spreading and de-spreading processes. This paper describes the proposed system and presents the theoretical and simulation results of the system performance in an additive white Gaussian noise channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6558830","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-encoded spread spectrum communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-encoded spread spectrum communications","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00822668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036585S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6639","citationCount":"28","articleId":"822668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":822669,"authors":[{"name":"So Ryoung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"So Ryoung Park","id":"38201085000"},{"name":"Iickho Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Iickho Song","id":"37289097300"},{"name":"Seokho Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seokho Yoon","id":"37279393400"},{"name":"Jooshik Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jooshik Lee","id":"37440997200"},{"name":"Seong Ro Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Mokpo\uc2a0National University, Mokpo, Jeollanam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong Ro Lee","id":"37351506500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5538-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"822669","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multiaccess communication","Random variables","AWGN","Interference","Frequency","Binary sequences","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Random sequences","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequences","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","fading channels","multipath channels","multiuser channels","random processes","radiofrequency interference","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic characteristics","direct sequence code division multiple access","random polyphase sequences","coherent reception","multipath fading channels","DS-CDMA signature sequences","multiple access interference","multipath interference","system performance","random phase sequences","random binary sequences","receiver","BPSK transmitters"]}],"abstract":"Direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) communication systems using random polyphase sequences with coherent reception in multipath fading channels are considered.

We evaluate the application of space-time forward error correction schemes in asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) system over frequency selective multipath fading channels. The space-time system, employing either a convolutional or turbo coding scheme, combines coding (temporal diversity), with RAKE (multipath diversity) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) (spatial diversity) to realize high capacity DS/CDMA mobile communication systems. The receiver considered employs a L-branch space-path RAKE receiver, followed by a soft-input (soft-output) channel decoder. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance and capacity tradeoff between various system parameters under a fixed total bandwidth expansion and error correction codes' complexity constraint requirements. It is shown that compared to uncoded systems, the proposed space-time coding system dramatically decreases the BER and increases the system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822712","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

These procedures include, initial synchronization, access channel acquisition and fine synchronization control. We also describe the system architecture and provide the performance evaluation. The main objective is to provide network wide synchronization of all uplink orthogonal CDMA transmissions. This is achieved in steps; first by providing coarse synchronization using the uplink random access channel and then fine sync using innovative tracking control mechanisms. The uplink access channel receiver utilize a parallel/serial search method for rapid code acquisition, while the code tracking of the uplink orthogonal CDMA traffic channel is based on a delay feedback early-late gate in which the sych control resides in the receiver. The proposed system is designed to minimize the onboard complexity and satisfy the performance requirements. As shown in the performance section, the requirement that all uplink transmissions are synchronized to a reference time within 10% of the chip length can be achieved. In addition, the system analysis determines the design parameters values which optimize performance.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822716","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999. IEEE Military Communications.

The complete range of channel power ratio is covered, with equal emphasis on the generic unbalanced case and the two limiting cases of BPSK and (balanced) QPSK. Analytic expressions are presented for the detected signal-to-noise ratio of carrier harmonics 2f and 4f as a function of SNR, channel power ratio, and normalized input bandwidth. The interest is in detecting covert direct sequence spread spectrum signals, i.e. those with SNR <0 dB. Measurements confirm every aspect of the theory. The least detectable signal type is balanced QPSK, which is detectable (at 4f) at a threshold SNR ranging from -2 to -13 dB as the detection process gain (chip rate/detection bandwidth) is varied from 40 to 80 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier detection of unbalanced QPSK direct sequence signals","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

In this combined coding/signalling scenario the turbo coder structure is exploited for a novel space-time processing approach. The binary input data to a rate 1/(M+1) multiple turbo encoder produces M+1 coded bits, which, in turn, are assigned through suitable puncturing patterns to M different antennas and transmitted from each antenna simultaneously. The novelty of the transmission scheme, is that the original single-antenna rate-1/2 turbo coded system is transformed into a more powerful rate-1/(M+1) turbo code. The bit error rate performance of a QPSK DS/CDMA system employing a short-frame space-time turbo-coded transmission scheme and RAKE diversity receiver is studied by means of simulation. It is shown that with the proposed system, employing M transmit antennas and an L-branch RAKE receiver, lower bit error rate performance can be achieved, compared to a conventional single antenna scheme. The latter results are achieved even in the presence of correlated fading conditions.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822740","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999. IEEE Military Communications.

The arithmetic operations of the MC encoder are the same as the ones of an ISI channel, therefore, an ISI channel and an MC can be naturally combined together. With the combination, the MC can be optimally designed for the mitigation of the ISI. In this paper, we propose a new coded zero-forcing decision feedback equalizer (ZF-DFE) using MC. For the MC coded ZF-DFE we present the performance analysis and the optimal MC design for a given ISI channel, where the coding gain based on the joint ZF-DFE is formulated comparing to the uncoded AWGN channel. Numerical results show that the MC coded ZF-DFE outperforms the conventional uncoded/coded ZF-DFE and the uncoded/coded Tomlinson-Harashima (TH) precoding at, at least, low channel SNR, where the BPSK is used.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6639/17706/00822744.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"560 vol.1","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

The satellite channel is modeled as combination of Rician fading and shadowed Rayleigh fading channels. The nonlinear Fokker-Planck method is employed to analyze the first-order PLL (phase locked loop) performance. Phase noise is modeled as Tikhonov distribution. The performance is evaluated in terms of bit error probability. The simulation results for BER performance with phase noise are shown in terms of many system parameters such as SNR, the number of users in a beam, and standard deviation of shadowing. From simulation results, it is concluded that the phase noise substantially degrades system performance of the CDMA-based satellite system. This can be interpreted that detection loss (decrease of SNR) due to phase noise leads to degradation of system performance. The considerations in this paper can be applied to a satellite link design for a CDMA-based satellite system.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822757","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

Additionally, current and future communications requirements will necessitate the transmission of many different types of information with a wide range of data rates over these wireless links. Rate adaptive signaling is a powerful way to design a robust system across such broad range of channel conditions because the system will not have to be designed for the worst case scenario and system resources can be utilized more efficiently. In this paper, we apply our previously proposed rate adaptive OFDM spread spectrum system concept to a LEO satellite (LEOS) communications application. We demonstrate the feasibility of rate adaptation by analyzing the link margin of a LEOS link characterized by free space loss, multipath fading and interference. A Doppler based rate adaptation algorithm is proposed to constantly measure and predict the mobile terminal received signal strength and to control the system processing gain accordingly. Desired system performance can be maintained across a large dynamic range of signal strength by the proper control of the processing gain.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1999.822758","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1999.

We describe preliminary results of research aimed at addressing vulnerability assessment of tactical battlefield environments through the application of the genetic algorithm and artificial life techniques.

Particularly, recent developments in optical technologies have made the realization of wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM PONs) feasible and cost-effective. These networks are more future-proof than conventional PONs, thanks to their intrinsic optical transparency and their extremely high transmission capacity. A very useful optical routing device, called waveguide grating router, is the basic building-block of new PON architectures capable of connecting a large number of users or to improve the use of the optical bandwidth. In this paper, we analyze the connectivity of WDM PONs composed of multiple stages of WGR devices. A design tool is also presented which is able to easily evaluate the connectivity functions of complex WDM PONs. The feasibility of these architectures is discussed by considering the costs and the technological limitations on the optical components.","doi":"10.1109/50.822785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17826","startPage":"125","endPage":"143","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17826/00822785.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.822785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and cost performance of the multistage WDM-PON access networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Passive optical networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical devices","Optical fiber networks","Optical waveguides","WDM networks","Ultraviolet sources","Routing","Gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","transparency","optical fibre networks","telecommunication network routing","diffraction gratings","optical waveguides","optical fibre subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage WDM-PON access network design","passive optical architectures","access network","optical technologies","wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks","WDM PON","future-proof","intrinsic optical transparency","extremely high transmission capacity","optical routing device","waveguide grating router","PON architectures","optical bandwidth","connectivity","design tool","connectivity functions","technological limitations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Design and cost performance of the multistage WDM-PON access networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6524405","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and cost performance of the multistage WDM-PON access networks","sourcePdf":"00822785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058334S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"81","articleId":"822785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":822807,"authors":[{"name":"Pit-Leong Wong","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Pit-Leong Wong","id":"37330958500"},{"name":"Q.

A lighting pole is installed in a street for area illumination. It has a translucent sign vinyl which shines in the sun and glows at night with fluorescent lamps; there are stainless steel receptacles used as recycle trash bin collectors at the base of the pole. The intented use of such a photovoltaic array to power the glassy advertisement works as a way of bringing solar energy into daily use, and to encourage companies in funding local recycle awareness campaigns. Solar energy is captured by a photovoltaic solar panel and delivered into a lead-acid battery through a flyback converter. The converter also performs the function of tracking the maximum power operating conditions. At night, a resonant push-pull current-fed inverter drives a fluorescent lamp. The system is controlled by a RISC PIC16C74 microcontroller, which searches the maximum power point by commanding the flyback converter with a hill-climbing algorithm, monitors the battery energy level, and turns on the fluorescent inverter with a real-time internal clock. Serial communication is provided for connection to a portable computer, which is used for battery life management and time clock settings. The paper shows the implementation of the whole system and describes comprehensive field tests.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2000.822832","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1156 vol.2","publicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

In these applications, human face is the most important region within a frame and should be coded with high fidelity. To preserve perceptually important information at low bit rates, such as face regions, skin-tone is used to detect and adaptively quantize these regions. Novel features of this coder are the use of overlapping block motion compensation in combination with discrete wavelet transform, followed by zerotree entropy coding with new scanning procedure of wavelet blocks such that the rest of the H.263 framework can be used. At the same total bit-rate, coarser quantization of the background enables the face region to be quantized finely and coded with higher quality. The simulation results demonstrates comparable objective and superior subjective performance when compared with H.263 video coding standard, while providing the advanced feature like scalability functionalities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content based very low bit rate video coding using wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.822856","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00822856.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.822856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Content based very low bit rate video coding using wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514158","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content based very low bit rate video coding using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00822856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067795S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"822856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":822861,"authors":[{"name":"A.

First, a limited but characteristic amount of frames are extracted from each video scene, by minimizing a cross-correlation criterion. Low level features are extracted to indicate the frame characteristics, such as color and motion segments. This is due to the fact that extraction of high-level, semantic, features from any kind of images is too hard to be implemented. After the key frame extraction, the video queries are implemented directly on this small number of frames. To reduce, however, the limitation of low-level features the human is considered as a part of the process, meaning that he/she is able to assign a degree of appropriateness for each retrieved image of the system and then restart the searching. A feedforward neural network structure is proposed as a parametric distance for the retrieval, mainly due to the highly non linear capabilities. An adaptation mechanism is also proposed for updating the network weights, each time a new image selection is performed by the user. This mechanism can modify the network weights so that the output of the network, after the adaptation, is as much as close to the user's selection while simultaneously performing a minimal degradation of the previous learned data.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.822866","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00822866.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.822866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to interactive content-based retrieval of video databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to interactive content-based retrieval of video databases","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6514168","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to interactive content-based retrieval of video databases","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00822866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039313S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"6","articleId":"822866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":822903,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

These techniques are effective against a certain level of errors. However, wireless channels often have very high error rates; thus channel coding is needed to reduce the number of errors in the compressed bitstream that is sent to the MPEG-4 video decoder. The structure of an MPEG-4 compressed bitstream lends itself to using unequal error protection to ensure fewer errors in the important portions of the bitstream. This paper discuses how unequal error protection can be used with the MPEG-4 error resilience tools and describes several experiments using both unequal and equal error protection on video sent through a simulated GSM channel. The results of these experiments show that when the bit error rate is high, unequal error protection can improve reconstructed video quality by as much as 1 dB compared with equal error protection.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822952","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","MPEG 4 Standard","Video compression","Code standards","Error analysis","Channel coding","Decoding","Resilience","GSM","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","data compression","telecommunication standards","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection","MPEG-4 compressed video","video compression standard","error-resilient coded video","wireless channels","channel coding","video decoder","error protection"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00822952.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"534 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.822952","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.822952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal error protection of MPEG-4 compressed video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822952/","displayDocTitle":"Unequal error protection of MPEG-4 compressed video","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514250","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal error protection of MPEG-4 compressed video","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00822952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069542S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"25","articleId":"822952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":822973,"authors":[{"name":"Chung Ming Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Naval Academy, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung Ming Kuo","id":"37087252167"},{"name":"Chaur Heh Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chaur Heh Hsieh","id":"37087370947"},{"name":"Mao Hsiung Hung","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mao Hsiung Hung","id":"37087907039"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5467-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"822973","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"The block-matching algorithm (BMA) is the most popular motion compensation technique in video coding.

In this technique, the 3D DCT is selected for regions where MC works well, while an arbitrary-shaped 2D DCT coding is applied to the rest of the regions. Compared with the conventional motion-compensated interframe coding technique which basically uses only two frames in encoding a single frame, the coding efficiency can be improved with the proposed method because it takes advantage of information from more frames or a longer coding delay. A theoretical analysis together with experimental evaluations of the proposed technique are given to show the improvement of the efficiency over the conventional MC+DCT video coding technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.822974","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00822974.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"648 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.822974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D/3D hybrid video coding based on motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822974/","displayDocTitle":"2D/3D hybrid video coding based on motion compensation","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514271","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D/3D hybrid video coding based on motion compensation","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00822974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031172S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","articleId":"822974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":822988,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The fine matching step detects roads accurately by applying the active contour models (snake) to the novel field called the potential field. In the fine matching step, we first extract ridges or ravines of curvilinear structures in SAR images, then construct the potential field by smoothing extracted structures.

For low bit-rate video codecs, the quantization effects introduced by the multiplier-free approach is considerably lower than the distortion introduced by the quantizer settings of the video codec and thus the overall PSNR loss is well within 1 dB for the proposed multiplier-free approach.

Moreover, due to the fact that the content of the two ROM's in the same processing element is the same, a substantial reduction in the hardware cost can be obtained using biport ROMs.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.822999","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00822999.pdf","startPage":"764","endPage":"768 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.822999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systolic array algorithm for an efficient unified memory-based implementation of the inverse discrete cosine and sine transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=822999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/822999/","displayDocTitle":"A systolic array algorithm for an efficient unified memory-based implementation of the inverse discrete cosine and sine transforms","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6521827","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systolic array algorithm for an efficient unified memory-based implementation of the inverse discrete cosine and sine transforms","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00822999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030392S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"9","articleId":"822999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":823001,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaehun Lee","id":"37087435452"},{"name":"Sung Deuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung Deuk Kim","id":"37087309116"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung Kyu Jang","id":"37087383664"},{"name":"Jong Beom Ra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Beom Ra","id":"37087221482"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5467-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"823001","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":37},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new VLSI architecture of a hierarchical motion estimator for low bit-rate video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823001","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion estimation","Video coding","Hardware","MPEG 4 Standard","Video compression","Computational complexity","Bandwidth","Degradation","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","image matching","image sequences","motion estimation","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","hierarchical motion estimator","low bit-rate video coding","prediction mode","video coders","H.263","MPEG-4","basic searching unit","motion estimator","scheduled data flow","block-based sum of absolute difference","macroblock-based motion vector","coding performance","full search block matching algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new hierarchical motion estimator architecture that supports the advanced prediction mode of recent low bit-rate video coders such as H.263 and MPEG-4. In the proposed VLSI architecture, a basic searching unit (BSU) is commonly utilized for all hierarchical levels to make a systematic and small sized motion estimator. Also, since the memory bank of the proposed architecture provides a scheduled data flow for calculating the 8\u00d78 block-based sum of absolute difference (SAD), both a macroblock-based motion vector (MV) and four block-based MVs per macroblock can be simultaneously obtained for the advanced prediction mode. Even with its small size of implementation, the proposed motion estimator provides similar coding performance as that of the full search block matching algorithm (FSBMA).","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.823001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.823001","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00823001.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"778 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A new VLSI architecture of a hierarchical motion estimator for low bit-rate video coding","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6521829","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new VLSI architecture of a hierarchical motion estimator for low bit-rate video coding","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00823001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041418S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","articleId":"823001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":823030,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We propose an algorithm for achieving this directly in the DCT domain which is computationally much faster, produces visually sharper images and gives significant improvements in PSNR (typically 4 dB better), compared to other compressed domain methods based on bilinear interpolation. The downsampling and upsampling schemes combined together preserve all the low-frequency DCT coefficients of the original image. This implies tremendous savings for coding the difference between the original (unsampled image) and its prediction (the upsampled image). This is desirable for many applications based on scalable encoding of video.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.823030","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17708/00823030.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"913 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.823030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast scheme for downsampling and upsampling in the DCT domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A fast scheme for downsampling and upsampling in the DCT domain","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514305","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823030/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast scheme for downsampling and upsampling in the DCT domain","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00823030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03084S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"6","articleId":"823030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":823032,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

These faults correspond to a loss of actuator effectiveness or fault sensor measurements. After describing these faults, a fault estimation and compensation method was proposed. In addition to providing information to operators concerning the system operating conditions, the fault diagnosis module is especially important in fault-tolerant control systems where one needs to know exactly which element is faulty to react safely. The method's abilities to compensate for such faults are illustrated by applying it to a winding machine, which represents a subsystem of many industrial systems. The results show that once the fault is detected and isolated, it is easy to reduce its effect on the system, and process control is resumed with degraded performances close to nominal ones. Thus, stopping the system immediately can be avoided. However, the limits of this method are reached when there is the complete loss of an actuator. In this case, only a hardware redundancy is effective and could ensure performance reliability. The method proposed here assumes the availability of the state variables for measurement.","doi":"10.1109/37.823226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/17825/00823226.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.823226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant control in dynamic systems: application to a winding machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823226/","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant control in dynamic systems: application to a winding machine","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6523323","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant control in dynamic systems: application to a winding machine","sourcePdf":"00823226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078798S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"207","articleId":"823226","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823229,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The paper presents an approach to handle mixed attributes and introduces the concept of degree of importance of each attribute-value contributing to the consequent of a given rule. Based on this new concept, a new heuristic for generating fuzzy decision trees with parameters is given and a set of weighted fuzzy rules with local weight and certainty factor are extracted from the trees. The advantages of the learning is initially verified by the Iris classification problem.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Fuzzy sets","Production","Knowledge representation","Induction generators","Machine learning","Fuzzy neural networks","Iris","Fuzzy reasoning","Knowledge acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge representation","decision trees","learning by example","inference mechanisms","uncertainty handling","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted fuzzy rules","mixed attributes","fuzzy decision trees","degree of importance","attribute-value","Iris classification problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823229","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Zadeh has been used to handle and represent information which is vague, uncertain and imprecise. Many fuzzy control systems and expert systems have been developed to capture operator knowledge and domain expert knowledge respectively. Fuzzy production rules (FPRs) have been used to capture and represent domain expert knowledge for years. To draw an accurate, reasonable and reliable conclusion in a fuzzy expert system, the knowledge base plays an important role and is the heart of this system. Once a fuzzy expert system (FES) has been built, we are faced with a large number of parameters which need to be tuned in order to improve the system performance in terms of the results (conclusions) obtained. Many approaches have been proposed to tune the parameters of this system. The parameters include membership functions, weights (local and global), and certainty factors, etc. In this paper, a method is proposed to tune some of these parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neural network (NN). The neural network is used to model and capture parameters on its connection weights and provide initial values of these parameters for the genetic algorithm to optimize. The result of such tuning is that the overall system performance is greatly improved and the tuning task could be done automatically. A fuzzy expert system which provides expert advice for computer professionals and computer science graduates in selecting an appropriate job is used to test the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823232","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17812/00823232.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"371 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The larger the case library, the more the problem space covered, however, it would also downgrade the system performance if the number of cases grows to an unacceptably high level. In the paper, an approach to maintaining the size of a case-based expert system is proposed. The main idea is using the fuzzy class membership value of each record, determined by a trained neural network, to guide the record deletion. These fuzzy membership values are used to calculate the case density of each record, and a deletion policy can then be used to determine the percentage of record to be deleted. Using this approach, we could maintain the size of the case-base without loosing a significant amount of information. A testing case-base consisting of 214 records is used as an illustrative example of our approach, the neural network software NEURALWORKS PROFESSIONAL II/PLUS/sup (C)/ is used to develop the neural network. It was shown that it could reduce the size of the case library by 28% if we select those records that have an overall class membership of over 0.8 and case density over 0.95. Future work includes integrating adaptation rules for building deletion policy.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823242","startPage":"424","endPage":"428 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

It extends a previous study relying on observational data from a single point station to multiple point sources with time-series weather records in the Hong Kong region. Preprocessing procedures were important for this neural network modeling which was based on a backpropagation architecture. This involved variable transformation, classification and the use of genetic algorithms for input selection. Compared with previous studies on a single point source using a similar network and others like radial basis function networks, learning vector quantization and naive Bayesian network, the results are very promising.

Human-beings can distinguish useful information from those in ambiguous and noisy environments using attention functionality. It is said that human-beings may recognize information roughly at first, and pay attention to the detailed features to confirm what the information really means. The main difficulty in realizing the attention function in the computational model is to determine the part to which the system pays attention. To determine the attention areas automatically, the proposed model consists of three hierarchical neural networks, associative memory layer, middle layer and symbol layer. The associative memory plays a great role for finding out the features of the input pattern. The middle layer corresponds to the feature extracting layer. The units in each layer connect to the units in other layers. The connection weights between the layers are modified through a Hebbian learning rule. The connection weights between the input and the middle layers represent rough features of the input patterns, while those between the symbol and the input layers represent the attention areas. In the proposed model, these features and attention areas can be extracted automatically without the designers' knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823249","startPage":"465","endPage":"469 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The paper tries to make these observations more concrete guidelines for designing GAs. First, an alternative picture that captures the search process of the GA as evolution of the probability distribution function of the population is proposed. Then, based on this picture, a functional specialization hypothesis that specifies the roles of selection and crossover operators is proposed as guidelines to design GAs. Then, the state-of-the-art selection and crossover operators for continuous search spaces are introduced along the proposed guidelines. Further, crossover operators for discrete search spaces are also discussed from this viewpoint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823277/","accessionNumber":"6513530","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A functional specialization hypothesis for designing genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A functional specialization hypothesis for designing genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00823277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048458S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"28","articleId":"823277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":823278,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We refer to this method as a single-evaluation mode (SEM). We introduce a natural variant of this method, a multi-evaluation mode (MEM), where perturbations are given more than one time for each evaluating functional value of an individual, and we offer comparative studies on the convergence property. The results showed that for the GAs/RS/sup 3/ with SEM the population converges to robust solutions faster than with the MEM, and as the number of evaluations increases, the convergence speed decreases. We may conclude that the GAs/RS/sup 3/ with the SEM is more efficient than with the MEM. We also introduce a variation of MEM, i.e., multi-evaluation mode with the worst value (MEM-W) and provide a mathematical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823278","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17812/00823278.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"591 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

In designing lenses for a single wavelength, it is only required to optimize curvature of surfaces and gaps between surfaces that are continuous variables. The authors have proposed a real-coded GA using the UNDX as a crossover operator for lens design, which has shown good performance in optimizing continuous variables, curvature of surfaces and gaps between surfaces. However, the GA cannot be applied to designing lenses for multiple wavelengths such as camera lenses, microscope ones and telescope ones. In designing lenses for multiple wavelengths, it is also required to optimize glasses of lens elements that are discrete variables. In the paper, we enable the real-coded GA using the UNDX to optimize glasses as well as the curvatures of surfaces and gaps between surfaces by devising an encoding/decoding scheme. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through some experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823279","startPage":"592","endPage":"597 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Our basic idea is to explore effective genetic information in the population, i.e., schemata, and to exploit the genetic information in order to guide the population to better solutions. Our coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) consists of two GA populations; the first GA, called \"H-GA\", searches for the solutions in a given environment (problem), and the second GA, called \"P-GA\", searches for effective genetic information involved in the H-GA, namely, good schemata. Thus, each individual in P-GA consists of alleles in H-GA or \"don't care\" symbol representing a schema in the H-GA. These GA populations separately evolve in each genetic space at different abstraction levels and affect with each other by two genetic operators: \"superposition\" and \"transcription\". We then applied our CGA to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) incorporating a new stochastic \"repair\" operator for P-GA to raise the consistency of schemata with the (local) constraint conditions in CSPs. We carried out two experiments: First, we examined the performance of CGA on various \"general\" CSPs that are generated randomly for a wide variety of \"density\" and \"tightness\" of constraint conditions in the CSPs that are the basic measures of characterizing CSPs. Next, we examined \"structured\" CSPs involving latent \"cluster\" structures among the variables in the CSPs. For these experiments, computer simulations confirmed us the effectiveness of our CGA.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823283","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17812/00823283.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"621 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The method forces the users to evaluate all the solutions generated by the computer. Hence it is difficult to solve practical problems only using IGA because the user must evaluate a great number of solutions, and more sophisticated assistance by computer is needed. The paper considers problems whose solutions can be evaluated by the computer partially. We propose an IGA to reduce the number of evaluations by the users, enhanced by techniques such as multi-objective optimization and clustering. The proposed method is applied to a problem of generating animation of a pass-motion by hands so as to confirm usefulness of the method. Results of the experiments show that the proposed method can generate high quality solution with fewer stresses on the users.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.823289","startPage":"646","endPage":"651 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

When the total demand placed on system resources by the tasks, for a given interval of time, exceeds the resources available, some tasks will receive degraded service or no service at all. One part of a measure to quantify the success of a resource management system (RMS) in such a distributed environment is the collective value of the tasks completed during an interval of time, as perceived by the user, application, or policy maker. The flexible integrated system capability (FISC) ratio introduced here is a measure for quantifying this collective value. The FISC ratio is a multi-dimensional measure, and may include priorities, versions of a task or data, deadlines, situational mode, security, application- and domain-specific QoS, and dependencies. In addition to being used for evaluating and comparing RMS, the FISC ratio can be incorporated as part of the objective function in a system's scheduling heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/EMPDP.2000.823388","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6662/17807/00823388.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMPDP.2000.823388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS performance measure framework for distributed heterogeneous networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"A QoS performance measure framework for distributed heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6498762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS performance measure framework for distributed heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"00823388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042635S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"17807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6662","citationCount":"5","articleId":"823388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":823413,"authors":[{"name":"V.D.

In the past, too many approaches were devoted in efficient program parallelization considering various models for the parallel programs and the target architectures. The most widely used parallelism description model is the task graph model with precedence constraints. Nevertheless, as far as physical mapping of tasks onto parallel architectures is concerned little research has given practical results. It is well known that the physical mapping problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, thus allowing only for heuristic approaches. Most researchers or tool programmers use exhaustive algorithms, or the classical method of simulated annealing. This paper presents an alternative approach onto the mapping problem. Given the graph of clustered tasks, and the graph of the target distributed architecture, our heuristic finds a mapping by first placing the highly communicative tasks on adjacent nodes of the processor network. Once these \"backbone\" tasks are mapped there is no backtracking, thus achieving low complexity. Therefore, the remaining tasks are placed beginning from those close to the \"backbone\" tasks. The paper concludes with performance and comparison results which reveal the method's efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/EMPDP.2000.823437","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6662/17807/00823437.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMPDP.2000.823437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for the physical mapping of clustered task graphs onto multiprocessor architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823437/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algorithm for the physical mapping of clustered task graphs onto multiprocessor architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6498810","conferenceDate":"19-21 Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algorithm for the physical mapping of clustered task graphs onto multiprocessor architectures","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"00823437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115375S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"17807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6662","citationCount":"10","articleId":"823437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823439,"authors":[{"name":"Fenghao Mu","affiliation":["Switch Core, Lund, Sweden"],"lastName":"Fenghao Mu","id":"37360163000"},{"name":"C.

To investigate the loop stability, a linearized small signal analysis model is used.

The minimum charge necessary for flipping the state of a sensor cell, denoted by Q/sub CRIT/, is measured with 1%-2% accuracy before exposing the circuits to radiation. During the accelerated testing, circuits biased with multiple different supply voltages V/sub CC/ are simultaneously placed into a beam and any bit flips are logged. From the measured SER dependency on V/sub CC/ and previously measured Q/sub CRIT/ dependency on V/sub CC/, the dependency of SER on Q/sub CRIT/ can be deduced by correlating V/sub CC/'s for the two measurements. Furthermore, the sensor cell utilizes a single dynamic node which can be programmed to detect strikes on either N- or P-type diffusions, but not both at the same time. The measured dependency SER(Q/sub CRIT/), normalized by the diffusion area, can be used for predicting SER of any other circuit fabricated in the same process and aid designers in optimization for reduced SER. Predictions of a theoretical SER model, if one is available, can be compared directly with the measurements. Since the true Q/sub CRIT/ of the test circuits is known accurately, any discrepancy larger than given by the measurement uncertainty of SER(Q/sub CRIT/) would be clearly due to limitations of the SER model. We implemented the test circuits in a 0.6-/spl mu/m bulk CMOS process and verified accuracy of Q/sub CRIT/(V/sub CC/) calibration method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.823440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17827","startPage":"142","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17827/00823440.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized test circuits for SER characterization of a manufacturing process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimized test circuits for SER characterization of a manufacturing process","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6516990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized test circuits for SER characterization of a manufacturing process","sourcePdf":"00823440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04209S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"823440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":823441,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

(1) A clock generator based on a bidirectional delay (BDD) eliminates the output skew. The BDD measures the cycle time as the quantity charged or discharged of an analog quantity, and replicates it in the next cycle. This achieves a 0.18-mm/sup 2/, two-cycle-lock clock generator operating from 25 to 167 MHz with a 30-ps resolution. (2) A quad-coupled receiver eliminates the internal skew caused by the difference between a rise input and a fall input by 40%. (3) An interbank shared redundancy scheme (ISR) with a variable unit redundancy (VUR) efficiently increases yield in multibank DRAM's. The ISR allows redundancy match circuits to be shared with two or more banks. The VUR allows the number of units replaced to be variable. These circuit technologies achieved a 250-Mb/s/pin, 8-bank, 1-Gb double-data-rate synchronous DRAM.","doi":"10.1109/4.823441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17827/00823441.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.823441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 250-Mb/s/pin, 1-Gb double-data-rate SDRAM with a bidirectional delay and an interbank shared redundancy scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A 250-Mb/s/pin, 1-Gb double-data-rate SDRAM with a bidirectional delay and an interbank shared redundancy scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823441/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6516991","volume":"35","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 250-Mb/s/pin, 1-Gb double-data-rate SDRAM with a bidirectional delay and an interbank shared redundancy scheme","sourcePdf":"00823441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051767S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","articleId":"823441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":823442,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A physical equivalent circuit that can easily be implemented as a Spice subcircuit is first derived. The subcircuit includes a substrate network that accounts for the signal coupling occurring at HF from the drain to the source and the bulk. It is shown that the latter mainly affects the output admittance Y22. The bias and geometry dependence of the subcircuit components, leading to a scalable model, are then discussed with emphasis on the substrate resistances. Analytical expressions of the Y parameters are established and compared to measurements made on a 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS process. The Y parameters and transit frequency simulated with this scalable model versus frequency, geometry, and bias are in good agreement with measured data. The nonquasi-static effects and their practical implementation in the Spice subcircuit are then briefly discussed. Finally, a new thermal noise model is introduced. The parameters used to characterize the noise at HF are then presented and the scalable model is favorably compared to measurements made on the same devices used for the S-parameter measurement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","MOSFETs","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Semiconductor device modeling","Solid modeling","Hafnium","Geometry","Electrical resistance measurement","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit modelling","MOSFET","integrated circuit design","equivalent circuits","SPICE","network parameters","thermal noise","integrated circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS transistor modeling","RF IC design","circuit simulation","physical equivalent circuit","Spice subcircuit","substrate network","signal coupling","output admittance","geometry dependence","scalable model","substrate resistances","CMOS process","Y parameters","transit frequency","nonquasi-static effects","thermal noise model","0.25 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823444","doi":"10.1109/4.823444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17827/00823444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.823444","startPage":"186","endPage":"201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOS transistor modeling for RF IC design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MOS transistor modeling for RF IC design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6516994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOS transistor modeling for RF IC design","sourcePdf":"00823444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086243S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"200","articleId":"823444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823445,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Input and output are matched to 50 /spl Omega/, with worst-case return losses on the input and output of -7 and -10 dB, respectively.

Two types of distributed selectors are designed and fabricated using 0.16 /spl mu/m GaAs MESFET's with multilayer-interconnection structure. Both basically consist of eight stages of series-gated source-coupled field-effect transistor (FET) logic (SCFL) selector cell units laid out in a distributed fashion. The second circuit incorporates additional functions: a data input level shifter in each cell to make an SCFL interface for the data input and a balun for single-balance transformation of the clock input. A small-signal distributed amplifier design is extended to a large-signal distributed logic IC design, taking dynamic variations in transistor parameters into consideration. The error-free operation of both fabricated distributed selector IC's is confirmed at up to 40 Gbit/s, and the first IC still exhibited eye opening with 130 mV voltage swing of the inside measurement at 70 Gbit/s, which reaches 80% of f/sub T/ of the fabricated FET. These distributed selector IC's successfully exhibit eye opening at higher bit rates compared to the conventional lumped-element design selector.","doi":"10.1109/4.823451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"258","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State

TROG is similar to frequency-resolved optical gating except that the role of time and frequency is interchanged. For the DP-TROG geometry, we show that measurements of the autocorrelation trace of the pulse after propagation through a medium with variable dispersion together with a single measurement of its intensity spectrum contain sufficient information to reconstruct the pulse in amplitude and phase. Pulse reconstruction for this DP-TROG geometry works very well even for the case of a nonlinearly chirped double pulse. Compared with other methods, DP-TROG does not introduce an ambiguity in the direction of time for the pulse. Due to its simplicity and improved sensitivity. DP-TROC is expected to be useful in characterizing low-energy pulses.","doi":"10.1109/3.823457","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/17828/00823457.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.823457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-resolved optical gating based on dispersive propagation: a new method to characterize optical pulses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Optical propagation","Optical sensors","Optical pulses","Pulse measurements","Frequency","Phase measurement","Geometrical optics","Information geometry","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed optical techniques","optical dispersion","optical correlation","sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-resolved optical gating","dispersive propagation","optical pulses","TROG","noninterferometric method","ultrashort optical pulse amplitude","ultrashort optical pulse phase","DP-TROG geometry","autocorrelation trace","variable dispersion","intensity spectrum","pulse reconstruction","nonlinearly chirped double pulse","sensitivity","low-energy pulses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Time-resolved optical gating based on dispersive propagation: a new method to characterize optical pulses","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6525126","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-resolved optical gating based on dispersive propagation: a new method to characterize optical pulses","sourcePdf":"00823457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047154S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"19","articleId":"823457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":823466,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This model incorporates history-dependent ionization coefficients. Excellent fits to experimental gain and noise measurements for GaAs were achieved using an effective field approach and simple analytical expressions for the ionization probabilities. In the paper, we briefly review the history-dependent model and apply it to Al/sub 0.2/Ga/sub 0.8/As, In/sub 0.52/Al/sub 0.48/As and InP avalanche photodiodes. For the study, the gain and noise characteristics of a series of homojunction avalanche photodiodes with different multiplication thicknesses were measured and fit with the history-dependent model. A \"size-effect\" in thin (<0.5 /spl mu/m) multiplication regions, which is not adequately characterized by the local-field avalanche theory, was observed for each of these materials. The history-dependent model, on the other hand, achieved close agreement with the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/3.823466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/17828/00823466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.823466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17828","startPage":"198","endPage":"204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact ionization characteristics of III-V semiconductors for a wide range of multiplication region thicknesses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact ionization characteristics of III-V semiconductors for a wide range of multiplication region thicknesses","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6525134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact ionization characteristics of III-V semiconductors for a wide range of multiplication region thicknesses","sourcePdf":"00823466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06831S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"90","articleId":"823466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823480,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

The problem is cast as a dynamic programming/Markovian decision problem, which is computationally intractable by exact methods because of its large number of states and its complex modeling issues. We employed a neuro-dynamic programming framework, whereby the cost-to-go function is approximated using neural network architectures that are trained on simulated data. We report on the performance obtained using several different training methods, and we compare this performance with the optimal approach.","doi":"10.1109/3468.823480","startPage":"42","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/17829/00823480.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3468.823480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Missile defense and interceptor allocation by neuro-dynamic programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Missiles","Neural networks","Dynamic programming","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Learning","Resource management","Functional programming","Asset management","Counting circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military computing","operations research","resource allocation","neural nets","dynamic programming","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interceptor allocation","neuro-dynamic programming","missile defense","resource allocation","Markovian decision process","neural network","reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Missile defense and interceptor allocation by neuro-dynamic programming","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6508226","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Missile defense and interceptor allocation by neuro-dynamic programming","sourcePdf":"00823480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030135S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"64","articleId":"823480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":823505,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Bin Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Bin Huang","id":"37068855300"},{"name":"Yinchieh lai","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yinchieh lai","id":"37277035300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"823505","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical losses","Optical pulses","Optical ring resonators","Filtering","Resonator filters","Optical pulse generation","Fiber lasers","Semiconductor lasers","Optical fiber filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-pass filters","optical resonators","optical filters","optical pulse generation","optical couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss-less pulse intensity repetition-rate multiplication","optical all-pass filtering","pulse intensity repetition-rate multiplication","optical all-pass filtering techniques","intensity repetition-rate","optical pulse train","energy loss","multiplication factor","integer","practical implementation","cascaded side-coupled ring resonators","multireflection filters"]}],"abstract":"Schemes based on an optical all-pass filtering techniques for multiplying the intensity repetition-rate of an optical pulse train are examined.

It makes use of two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms, one for the first N users and one for the additional users. An iterative multistage detection technique is used to cancel interference between the two sets of users. At each stage of the detection process, the best estimate of the multiuser interference is synthesized using the decisions available from the previous stages, and this interference is subtracted from the user signals of interest before entering them to a threshold detector. The new concept is described using orthogonal code-division multiple access and time division multiple access as the two sets of signal waveforms, but we also briefly outline how it can be generalized to other orthogonal sets.","doi":"10.1109/4234.823531","startPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/17832/00823531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.823531","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple access using two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Multiple access using two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6508506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple access using two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms","sourcePdf":"00823531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033368S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"56","articleId":"823531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":823533,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The proposed system has the capability to detect and identify faulty components in an analog electronic circuit by analyzing its impulse response. Using wavelet decomposition to preprocess the impulse response drastically reduces the number of inputs to the neural network, simplifying its architecture and minimizing its training and processing time. The second preprocessing by principal component analysis can further reduce the dimensionality of the input space and/or select input features that minimize diagnostic errors. Input normalization removes large dynamic variances over one or more dimensions in input space, which tend to obscure the relevant data fed to the neural network.

The standard version of the LMMSE receiver (postcombining LMMSE) minimizes the mean-squared error between the filter output and the true transmitted data sequence. Since the detector depends on the channel coefficients of all users, it cannot be implemented adaptively in fading channels due to severe tracking problems. A modified criterion for deriving LMMSE receivers (precombining LMMSE) in fading channels is presented. The precombining LMMSE receiver is independent of the users' complex channel coefficients, and it effectively converts the time-varying Rayleigh fading channel to an equivalent fixed additive white Gaussian noise channel from the point of view of updating the detector. The performance of the LMMSE receivers in fading channels is studied via computer simulations and numerical analysis. The results show that the postcombining LMMSE receiver has potentially larger capacity, but it cannot be used in fast fading channels. The precombining LMMSE receiver has slightly worse capacity than the postcombining LMMSE receiver, but remarkably larger capacity than the conventional RAKE receiver at the signal-to-noise ratios of practical interest.","doi":"10.1109/26.823551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17833/00823551.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.823551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LMMSE detection for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823551/","displayDocTitle":"LMMSE detection for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6525197","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LMMSE detection for DS-CDMA systems in fading channels","sourcePdf":"00823551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047306S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"82","articleId":"823551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823552,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown that nonstandard signal set partitionings and multistage decoding provide excellent UEP capabilities beyond those achievable with conventional coded modulation. The coding scheme is designed in such a way that the most important information bits have a lower error rate than other information bits. The large effective error coefficients, normally associated with standard mapping by set partitioning, are reduced by considering nonstandard partitionings of the underlying signal set. The bits-to-signal mappings induced by these partitionings allow the use of soft-decision decoding of binary block codes. Moreover, parallel operation of some of the staged decoders is possible, to achieve high data rate transmission, so that there is no error propagation between these decoders. Hybrid partitionings are also considered that trade off increased intraset distances in the last partition levels with larger effective error coefficients in the middle partition levels. The error performance of specific examples of multilevel codes over 8-PSK and 64-QAM signal sets are simulated and compared with theoretical upper bounds on the error performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.823553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17833","startPage":"204","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17833/00823553.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel coded modulation for unequal error protection and multistage decoding .I.

It is assumed that neither the energies nor the carrier phases of the signals of any of the users are available at the receiver. Previously, a post-decorrelative generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based detector was proposed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we introduce the concept of noncoherent decision feedback (DF) that forms the basis for an improved solution to the same problem. The users are detected sequentially in some fixed order, and the decision for a particular user takes advantage of the reduction of uncertainty associated with the signal space resulting from decisions already made for previous users. In contrast to coherent DF, therefore, the feedforward and feedback transformations in the noncoherent case are themselves functions of the matched filter outputs. An efficient implementation of the noncoherent DF detector for M-ary modulation and /spl rho/-dimensional signal space requires O(M/sub /spl rho//) computational complexity per user. Upper and lower bounds on its symbol error probability are obtained. It is shown that significant improvements over the post-decorrelative GLRT-based detector are often possible. Sufficient conditions are obtained which guarantee, without ignoring error-propagation effects, that the high signal-to-noise performance of the DF strategy can be as good as its genie-aided version in which perfect past users' decisions are used.","doi":"10.1109/26.823559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.823559","startPage":"259","endPage":"269","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17833/00823559.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent decision-feedback multiuser detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent decision-feedback multiuser detection","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6532790","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823559/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent decision-feedback multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"00823559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032278S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"823559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":823560,"authors":[{"name":"Yu.T.

The method is applied to frequency-hop communications with Reed-Solomon coding and error-and-erasures decoding. The proposed algorithm is based on decision feedback to eliminate statistical dependence among the envelope detectors' outputs of an M-ary frequency-shift keying noncoherent demodulator. The performance is analyzed for fading channels with different levels of frequency selectivity and synchronous multiple-access interference. It is shown that the use of memoryless decision rules results in complete inefficiency in such channel conditions, whereas the proposed rule provides large coding gains even for severe selectivity. The performance sensitivity with respect to the estimation of the power delay profile denotes high robustness of the proposed approach, provided that the selectivity is somewhat overestimated.

Such switches can also transmit signals with multiple wavelengths simultaneously. Despite these advantages, DCs suffer from an intrinsic crosstalk problem that must be overcome in building a robust switching system. In this paper, the principles of constructing strictly nonblocking DC-based photonic switching systems under various crosstalk constraints are explored. We demonstrate how crosstalk adds a new dimension to the theory of switching systems. We find the sufficient nonblocking condition for photonic networks under crosstalk constraints and demonstrate that some well-known nonblocking networks can tolerate a stricter crosstalk constraint while retaining their hardware complexity. The theory developed in the paper can guide us in making the design tradeoff between the level of crosstalk and the amount of hardware.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17833/00823564.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.823564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.823564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strictly nonblocking directional-coupler-based switching networks under crosstalk constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching systems","Switches","Optical attenuators","Optical waveguides","Coupling circuits","Optical coupling","Optical crosstalk","Optical sensors","Hardware","Directional couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic switching systems","multistage interconnection networks","optical crosstalk","optical directional couplers","electro-optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonblocking directional-coupler-based switching networks","crosstalk constraint","multiple wavelength signal transmission","robust switching system","nonblocking DC-based photonic switching systems","sufficient nonblocking condition","photonic networks","hardware complexity","strictly nonblocking switching networks","electro-optical switching device","Banyan network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Strictly nonblocking directional-coupler-based switching networks under crosstalk constraint","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6532796","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strictly nonblocking directional-coupler-based switching networks under crosstalk constraint","sourcePdf":"00823564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061415S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"94","articleId":"823564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":823565,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that the interface-states and oxide-trapped charges should originate from different types of carriers due to the separation of the locations of their peak values. The further evidence of the measured distribution of the interface-states in the band-gap shows that the carriers travelling toward the gate edge would be the dominant carrier for the generation of interface-states while the carriers travelling away from the gate edge will generate oxide-trapped charges through the help of the vertical electric field. These results should be very useful for the reliability analysis of flash memories.","doi":"10.1109/55.823576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/17834/00823576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.823576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17834","startPage":"123","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new observation of band-to-band tunneling induced hot-carrier stress using charge-pumping technique [MOSFETs]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new observation of band-to-band tunneling induced hot-carrier stress using charge-pumping technique [MOSFETs]","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6525244","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new observation of band-to-band tunneling induced hot-carrier stress using charge-pumping technique [MOSFETs]","sourcePdf":"00823576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025947S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"8","articleId":"823576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":823749,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Initial materials based on slip cast TiO/sub 2/ exhibited a high bulk breakdown strength (BDS>300 kV/cm) and high permittivity with low dispersion (/spl epsi//spl ap/100). However, strong area and thickness dependencies were noted. To increase the BDS, multilayer dielectric compositions are being developed based on glass/TiO/sub 2/ composites. The addition of glass increases the density (/spl ap/99.8% theoretical), forms a continuous grain boundary phase, and also allows the use of high temperature processes to change the physical shape of the dielectric. The permittivity can also be manipulated since the volume fraction and connectivity of the glassy phase can be readily shifted. Results from this study on bulk breakdown of TiO/sub 2/ multilayer structures with an area of 2 cm/sup 2/ and 0.1 cm thickness have measured 650 kV/cm. Furthermore, a strong dependence of breakdown strength and permittivity has been observed and correlated with microstructure and the glass composition. This paper presents the interactive effects of manipulation of these variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823749/","accessionNumber":"6537498","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High breakdown strength, multilayer ceramics for compact pulsed power applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High breakdown strength, multilayer ceramics for compact pulsed power applications","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00823749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023411S","chronDate":"27-30 June 1999","isNumber":"17806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6660","citationCount":"16","articleId":"823749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":823805,"authors":[{"name":"V.G.

All calculations were thoroughly calibrated against dc and RF experimental data. The simulations indicate operation at elevated temperature at least up to 5000/spl deg/C is possible. The RF output power capability of these devices compares very favorably with the 1 W/mm available from GaAs MESFETs. The wide bandgap semiconductor devices will find application in power amplifiers for base station transmitters for wireless telephone systems, HDTV transmitters, power modules for phased-array radars, and other applications.

This is the first MOSFET ever built that combines (1) a gate length controlled precisely through a deposited film thickness, independently of lithography and etch, and (2) a high-quality gate oxide grown on a single-crystal Si channel. In addition to this unique combination, the VRG-MOSFET includes a self-aligned S/D formed by solid source diffusion (SSD) and small parasitic overlap, junction, and S/D capacitances. The drive current per /spl mu/m of coded width is significantly higher than that of advanced planar MOSFETs because each rectangular device pillar (with a thickness of minimum lithographic dimension) contains two MOSFETs driving in parallel. All of this is achieved using current manufacturing methods, materials, and tools, and competitive devices with 50-nm gate lengths (L/sub G/) have been demonstrated without advanced lithography.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.823850","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

Vegetation cover complicates the scattering and emission processes, and it has been presumed that the addition of vegetation masks the soil surface, thereby reducing the radiometric and radar soil-moisture sensitivities. Even though researchers working in the field of microwave remote sensing of soil moisture are all likely to agree with the preceding two statements, numerous claims and counterclaims have been voiced, primarily at symposia and workshops, espousing the superiority of the radiometric technique over the radar, or vice versa. The discussion is often reduced to disagreements over the answer to the following question \"Which of the two sensing techniques is less impacted by vegetation cover?\" This paper is an attempt to answer that question. Using realistic radiative-transfer models for the emission and backscatter, calculations were performed for three types of canopies, all at 1.5 GHz. The results lead to two major conclusions. First, the accepted presumption that vegetation cover reduces the soil-moisture sensitivity is not always true. Over certain ranges of the optical depth /spl tau/ of the vegetation canopy and the roughness of the soil surface, vegetation cover can enhance, not reduce, the radar sensitivity to soil moisture. The second conclusion is that under most vegetation and soil-surface conditions, the radiometric and radar soil-moisture sensitivities decrease with increasing /spl tau/, and the rates are approximately the same for both sensors, suggesting that at least as far as vegetation effects are concerned, neither sensor can claim superiority over the other.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6525257","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity to soil moisture by active and passive microwave sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity to soil moisture by active and passive microwave sensors","sourcePdf":"00823905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043788S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"93","articleId":"823905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823916,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The motivation for studying this frequency band is the recent development of the CARABAS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In order to model the scattering from branches and trunks, homogeneous dielectric cylinders placed above a semi-infinite di-electric ground have been analyzed. An analytical approach, where the theoretically exact currents induced in an infinite cylinder are truncated, has been compared to a numerical solution using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. If the first-order coherent ray tracing is included in the analytical approach, the results match well with the numerically exact FDTD solution. The results show that, in order to determine the VHF-backscattering from a forest stand, the coherent ground interaction is an important part and has to be considered. In this paper, modeling results are in good agreement with CARABAS measurements.","doi":"10.1109/36.823916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17840/00823916.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.823916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coherent scattering model to determine forest backscattering in the VHF-band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823916/","displayDocTitle":"A coherent scattering model to determine forest backscattering in the VHF-band","volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6525259","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coherent scattering model to determine forest backscattering in the VHF-band","sourcePdf":"00823916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125333S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"29","articleId":"823916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":823917,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The fact that the constituent elements of these targets can be as large as the vegetation layer make this formulation problematic. For example, a grass element may extend from the soil surface to the top of the canopy, and thus the upper portion of the element can be illuminated with far greater energy than the bottom. By modeling the long, thin elements of this type of vegetation as line dipole elements, this nonuniform illumination can be accounted for. Additionally, the stature and structure of grass plants can result in situations where the average inner-product of coherent terms are significant at lower frequencies. As a result, the backscattering coefficient cannot be modeled simply as the incoherent addition of the power from each element and scattering mechanism. To determine these coherent terms, a coherent model that considers scattered fields, and not power, is provided. This formulation is then used to provide a solution to the multiple coherent scattering terms, terms which include the correlation of the scattering between both dissimilar constituent elements and dissimilar scattering mechanisms. Finally, a major component of the grass family are cultural grasses, such as wheat and barley. This vegetation is often planted in row structures, a periodic organization that can likewise result in significant coherent scattering effects, depending on the frequency and illumination pattern. Therefore, a formulation is also provided that accounts for the unique scattering of these structures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6532859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic scattering from grassland.

While the new sensor technology provides higher spectral and spatial resolution, enabling a greater number of spectrally separable classes to be identified, the needed labeled samples for designing the classifier remain difficult and expensive to acquire. Better parameter estimates can be obtained by exploiting a large number of unlabeled samples in addition to training samples, using the expectation maximization algorithm under the mixture model. However, the estimation method is sensitive to the presence of statistical outliers. In remote sensing data, miscellaneous classes with few samples are often difficult to identify and may constitute statistical outliers. Therefore, the authors propose to use a robust parameter-estimation method for the mixture model. The proposed method assigns full weight to training samples, but automatically gives reduced weight to unlabeled samples. Experimental results show that the robust method prevents performance deterioration due to statistical outliers in the data as compared to the estimates obtained from the direct EM approach.","doi":"10.1109/36.823939","startPage":"439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17841/00823939.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.823939","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust parameter estimation for mixture model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Robust parameter estimation for mixture model","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6532869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust parameter estimation for mixture model","sourcePdf":"00823939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040966S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"82","articleId":"823939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823940,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It can be exploited for oceanic surface current measurements from aircraft or spacecraft. However, as already discussed in previous publications, the mean Doppler frequency of the radar backscatter from the ocean is not exclusively determined by the mean surface current, but it includes contributions associated with surface wave motion. The authors present an efficient new model for the simulation of Doppler spectra and ATI signatures. The model is based on Bragg scattering theory in a composite surface model approach. They show that resulting Doppler spectra are consistent with predictions of an established model based on fundamental electrodynamic expressions, while computation times are reduced by more than one order of magnitude. This can be a key advantage with regard to operational applications of ATI. Based on model calculations for two simple current fields and various wind conditions and radar configurations, they study theoretical possibilities and limitations of oceanic current measurements by ATI. They find that best results can be expected from ATI systems operated at high microwave frequencies like 10 GHz (X band), high incidence angles like 60/spl deg/, low platform altitude/speed ratios, and vertical (VV) polarization. The ATI time lag should be chosen long enough to obtain measurable phase differences, but much shorter than the decorrelation time of the backscattered field.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical study on the along-track interferometric radar imaging mechanism of oceanic surface currents","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.823940","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17841/00823940.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.823940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17841","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Numerical study on the along-track interferometric radar imaging mechanism of oceanic surface currents","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6532870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical study on the along-track interferometric radar imaging mechanism of oceanic surface currents","sourcePdf":"00823940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028819S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"182","articleId":"823940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":823944,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

It has been shown previously that nonuniform sampling has the advantage of unambiguous estimates beyond the Nyquist frequency; however, the effect of sampling on the Cramer-Rao bounds is not well known. This paper first derives the maximum likelihood estimators and Cramer-Rao bounds for the parameters with known, arbitrary sampling times. It then outlines two methods for incorporating random sampling times into the lower variance bounds, describing one in detail. It is then shown that for a signal with additive white Gaussian noise the bounds for the estimation with nonuniform sampling tend toward those of uniform sampling. Thus, nonuniform sampling overcomes the ambiguity problems of uniform sampling without incurring the penalty of an increased variance in parameter estimation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.823961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17842/00823961.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"337","doi":"10.1109/78.823961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance bounds for polynomial phase parameter estimation with nonuniform and random sampling schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Performance bounds for polynomial phase parameter estimation with nonuniform and random sampling schemes","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6518480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance bounds for polynomial phase parameter estimation with nonuniform and random sampling schemes","sourcePdf":"00823961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029387S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","articleId":"823961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823962,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The resulting beamformer is a weighted sum of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers pointed at a set of candidate DOAs, where the relative contribution of each MVDR beamformer is determined from the a posteriori PDF of the DOA conditioned on previously observed data.

The concept of \"partial coherence\" is introduced to account for temporal as well as spatial correlation effects often encountered in a Rayleigh fading-type propagation channel formed between a source and sensor array elements. A simple parametric model for temporal channel correlation is presented, yielding an overall spatio-temporal channel model that is more realistic than formerly proposed models (which assume either full or zero temporal channel correlation). Thus, previously proposed \"distributed source\" models for bearing estimation problems are generalized to a parametric spatio-temporal model for what is called \"partially coherently distributed (PCD) sources\". A study of the associated Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is undertaken for a simple but illustrative problem formulation. The inherent limitations in bearing estimation accuracy for this spatio-temporal problem are seen to lie between the cases of zero and full temporal correlation, becoming more severe as temporal channel correlation increases. In addition, the associated maximum likelihood estimators for source bearing are proposed, and their performance is compared with that predicted by the CRB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6518489","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bearing estimation for a distributed source: modeling, inherent accuracy limitations and algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing estimation for a distributed source: modeling, inherent accuracy limitations and algorithms","sourcePdf":"00823970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035985S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","articleId":"823970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":823972,"authors":[{"name":"Jo Yew Tham","affiliation":["Wavelets Strategic Research Programme, Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jo Yew Tham","id":"37443961100"},{"name":"Lixin Shen","affiliation":["Wavelets Strategic Research Programme, Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lixin Shen","id":"37361704300"},{"name":"Seng Luan Lee","affiliation":["Wavelets Strategic Research Programme, Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Seng Luan Lee","id":"37443962500"},{"name":"Hwee Huat Tan","affiliation":["Wavelets Strategic Research Programme, Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Hwee Huat Tan","id":"37443962000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"823972","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Image coding","Filter bank","Filtering","Robustness","Image analysis","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","Signal generators","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","data compression","image coding","transform coding","filtering theory","channel bank filters","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general approach","discrete multiwavelet transforms","image compression","equivalent scalar filter bank system","wavelet filter bank system","sufficient representation","equivalent representation","multiwavelet system","good multifilter properties","filter characteristics","refinement masks","multiwavelet initialization","preanalysis multirate filtering","post-synthesis multirate filtering","simulations","orthogonal multiwavelets","biorthogonal multiwavelets","Daubechies'D8 wavelet","D(9/7) wavelet","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a general paradigm for the analysis and application of discrete multiwavelet transforms, particularly to image compression. First, we establish the concept of an equivalent scalar (wavelet) filter bank system in which we present an equivalent and sufficient representation of a multiwavelet system of multiplicity r in terms of a set of r equivalent scalar filter banks. This relationship motivates a new measure called the good multifilter properties (GMPs), which define the desirable filter characteristics of the equivalent scalar filters. We then relate the notion of GMPs directly to the matrix filters as necessary eigenvector properties for the refinement masks of a given multiwavelet system. Second, we propose a generalized, efficient, and nonredundant framework for multiwavelet initialization by designing appropriate preanalysis and post-synthesis multirate filtering techniques. Finally, our simulations verified that both orthogonal and biorthogonal multiwavelets that possess GMPs and employ the proposed initialization technique can perform better than the popular scalar wavelets such as Daubechies'D8 wavelet and the D(9/7) wavelet, and some of these multiwavelets achieved this with lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/78.823972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17842/00823972.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.823972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general approach for analysis and application of discrete multiwavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823972/","displayDocTitle":"A general approach for analysis and application of discrete multiwavelet transforms","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6518491","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general approach for analysis and application of discrete multiwavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00823972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049151S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"84","articleId":"823972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823974,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In the noiseless real-mixture two-source two-sensor scenario, once the observations are whitened (decorrelated and normalized), only a Givens rotation matrix remains to be identified in order to achieve the source separation. In this paper an adaptive estimator of the angle that characterizes such a rotation is derived. It is shown to converge to a stable valid separation solution with the only condition that the sum of source kurtosis be distinct from zero. An asymptotic performance analysis is carried out, resulting in a closed-form expression for the asymptotic probability density function of the proposed estimator. It is shown how the estimator can be incorporated into a complete adaptive source separation system by combining it with an adaptive prewhitening strategy and how it can be useful in a general BSS scenario of more than two signals by means of a pairwise approach. A variety of simulations assess the accuracy of the asymptotic results, display the properties of the estimator (such as its robust fast convergence), and compare this on-line BSS implementation with other adaptive BSS procedures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17842/00823974.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.823974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.823974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive blind source separation for virtually any source probability density function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Source separation","Decorrelation","Performance analysis","Closed-form solution","Probability density function","Adaptive systems","Displays","Robustness","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","probability","decorrelation","matrix algebra","convergence of numerical methods","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive blind source separation","source probability density function","statistically independent source signal recovery","linear mixtures","real-mixture two-source two-sensor scenario","whitened observations","decorrelation","normalization","Givens rotation matrix","adaptive estimator","source kurtosis sum","asymptotic performance analysis","closed-form expression","asymptotic probability density function","adaptive source separation system","adaptive prewhitening","pairwise approach","simulations","robust fast convergence","on-line BSS implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive blind source separation for virtually any source probability density function","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6518493","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive blind source separation for virtually any source probability density function","sourcePdf":"00823974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034709S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","articleId":"823974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823977,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jia Li","id":"37336343000"},{"name":"A.

Conventional block-based classification algorithms decide the class of a block by examining only the feature vector of this block and ignoring context information. In order to improve classification by context, an algorithm is proposed that models images by two dimensional (2-D) hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM considers feature vectors statistically dependent through an underlying state process assumed to be a Markov mesh, which has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions is reflected simultaneously. The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. To classify an image, the classes with maximum a posteriori probability are searched jointly for all the blocks.

The method's efficacy is demonstrated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/78.823980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17842/00823980.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.823980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint symbol detection and channel parameter estimation in asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=823980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823980/","displayDocTitle":"Joint symbol detection and channel parameter estimation in asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6518499","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint symbol detection and channel parameter estimation in asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00823980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026537S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","articleId":"823980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":823982,"authors":[{"name":"Guangrong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Guangrong Yan","id":"37087729961"},{"name":"H.

Second, the point tariff, price area congestion control model used in the Nordpool market area in Norway and Sweden. Third, the US transaction-based model.

Each maintains power system security but differs in its impact on the economics of the energy market. No clearly superior method has so far emerged. In the future, methods of combining decentralized market solutions with operational use of optimal power flow may provide better solutions to existing and emerging problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/823997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","volume":"88","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6502796","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission management in the deregulated environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission management in the deregulated environment","sourcePdf":"00823997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046223S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"530","articleId":"823997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":823999,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is not only suitable for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system but also suitable for vestigial sideband modulation (VSB) system. This dual mode equalizer consists of fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) and decision feedback equalizer (DFE) architecture. The FSE has 12 taps filter and uses sign-delayed LMS (SDLMS) coefficients updating methodology with \"stop-and-go\" algorithm. The DFE has 13 taps filter and uses sign-delayed LMS coefficients updating methodology. Also, a multi-state control scheme, a multi-slice slicer and a multi-step size are used to speed up the convergence of system. The system data rate is 5 MBaud and the maximum internal operation clock of the equalizer is 102 MHz. The chip is implemented with 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS TSMC 1P3M technology. The core area is 4044 /spl mu/m/spl times/4044 /spl mu/m and consumes 1.938 W power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"AP-ASIC'99. First IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on ASICs (Cat.

Although the techniques selecting polynomial functions can generate various acceleration and deceleration characteristics, the major problem is the computational load. The digital convolution techniques are more efficient than the techniques selecting polynomial functions. However, neither velocity profiles of which the deceleration characteristics is independent from the acceleration characteristics nor those of which the acceleration interval is different from the deceleration interval can be generated by the digital convolution techniques. This paper proposes a generalized approach for generating velocity profiles that cannot be generated by the digital convolution techniques. According to the desired characteristics of acceleration and deceleration, each set of coefficients is calculated and is stored. Given a moving distance, and acceleration and deceleration intervals, a velocity profile having the desired characteristics of acceleration and deceleration can be efficiently generated by using these coefficients. Several velocity profiles generated by the proposed technique are applied to one single-axis control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6507841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A generalized approach for the acceleration and deceleration of industrial robots and CNC machine tools","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized approach for the acceleration and deceleration of industrial robots and CNC machine tools","sourcePdf":"00824135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03713S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"93","articleId":"824135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824136,"authors":[{"name":"A.

MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint movements and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic applications, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics are not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that assures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solution is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global minimum-jerk trajectory planning of robot manipulators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.824136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/17843/00824136.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.824136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Global minimum-jerk trajectory planning of robot manipulators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6507842","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global minimum-jerk trajectory planning of robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00824136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024954S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"222","articleId":"824136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":824137,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

In this paper, a joint acceleration feedback control scheme of high bandwidth is employed to damp oscillations during the contact transition when the approaching speed does not vanish. In this control scheme, a classical integral force controller is refined by means of joint acceleration and velocity feedback. This is intended to achieve a stable contact transition without need of adjusting the controller parameters adaptive to the unknown or changing environments. Extensive experiments are conducted on the third joint of a three-link direct-drive robot to verify the proposed scheme for the environments of various stiffnesses, including elastic (sponge), less-elastic (cardboard), and hard (steel plate) surfaces. Results are also compared with those by the transition control without the acceleration feedback. The proposed scheme is shown to be promising in terms of robustness, stability and adaptability.","doi":"10.1109/41.824137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.824137","startPage":"150","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/17843/00824137.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact transition control via joint acceleration feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Contact transition control via joint acceleration feedback","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6507843","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824137/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact transition control via joint acceleration feedback","sourcePdf":"00824137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032007S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"12","articleId":"824137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":824138,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As compared with classical approaches, VQ encoding can give some hints about the contents of image regions; such additional information can be exploited to boost location performance. The VQ system can be trained by way of examples; this gives the advantages of adaptiveness and on-field tuning.

The sensing scheme generates highly uniform and fatigue-free reference level, and thus provides a reliable sensing margin. A novel technology to evaluate charge distribution of all memory cells is used for identifying the root causes of bit failure which are most critical factor for yield loss. Using this technology, hydrogen damage and etching damage are found to be the major loss factors. By eliminating the etch-damage with wet treatment and by using robust hydrogen-barrier, a wide sensing window, /spl Delta/Qref=74 fC, was achieved for highly manufacturable FRAM.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.824151","startPage":"279","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

The activation energy of charge-to-breakdown (Q/sub bd/) of the metal gates is identical with that of the poly-Si gate under the gate injection stress.

Technical Digest (Cat. No.99CH36318)","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new method to improve linearity of GaAs power FETs. Based on a Volterra series analysis, the 3rd order intermodulation distortion (IM3) ratio was found to be proportional to g/sub m//sup -2/ when output power P/sub out/ is fixed. Increasing g/sub m/ is hence a very effective method to improve IM3. To enlarge g/sub m/ while keeping the breakdown voltage high, two possible ways are considered for our GaAs power FET. One way is to thin the AlGaAs barrier layer. The other is to increase donor density in the n-GaAs channel layer and to thin the channel layer simultaneously. Since either way gives rise to an increase in the threshold voltage, one of the embodiments of the new method is an E-mode FET. An E-mode GaAs power FET based on the new method exhibited an IM3 ratio of -36 dBc and a power added efficiency (PAE) of 35% at an average P/sub out/ of 47 dBm and a frequency of 2.2 GHz. The IM3 ratio and the PAE achieved are 8 dB better and 10% higher than those of the prior work.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1999.824180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17838","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

It is revealed that the direct tunneling current in an unstressed MOS (n/sup +/-poly Si/SiO/sub 2//Si substrates) structure has a strong bias polarity dependence, which is determined through the competing effects of tunneling probability and the number of tunneling carriers. It is also found that a leakage path allowing the flow of holes dominates SILC and leakage current after soft breakdown in stressed oxides less than 5 nm. This leakage path has the asymmetric carrier conduction property that current from the Si substrate is much larger than that from the n/sup +/-poly gate.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.824193","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

Using nano-prober technique, MOS characteristics of failure bit in actual memory cell had been measured directly. That confirmed drain current of PMOS was about one order smaller and threshold voltage was about 1 V higher than that of normal bit. Newly developed unique selective etching technique using hydrazine mixture showed these degradations ware caused by local gate depletion.

Minimizing grain size of gate poly-Si is found to be quite effective for improving drain current degradation and suppressing failure mode.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.824196","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

Stress is also a major component of narrow-width effects, and explains why Idsat scaling with W differs for NMOS and PMOS devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1999.824277","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

Moreover, we demonstrate that this SPD can be used for process characterisation and monitoring, and extraction tool validation.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.824293","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

This performance was obtained using AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on SiC substrates for superior heat dissipation. However, these devices used a low Al mole fraction of 14% in the AlGaN layer, which had been shown to be less preferred in an earlier study with devices grown on sapphire substrates.

High-density, embedded ferroelectric memory (FeRAM) has the potential to replace embedded flash, embedded DRAM, and non-cache SRAM and could be a key enabler for future system-on-a-chip applications. Despite this appeal, the evidence that ferroelectric capacitors can be scaled to the submicron regime has been limited. In this paper, we report the fabrication and electrical properties of submicron PZT capacitors formed using both planar bottom electrodes and W plug contact structures. We observe that the aggregate saturation polarization value is nearly independent of individual capacitor area in the measured range from the contact-limited size of 0.12 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ to 10/sup 4/ /spl mu/m/sup 2/. This result suggests that high-density, embedded FeRAM technology may be feasible.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1999.824305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1999.824305","endPage":"942","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1999.

In this paper we present four low-cost high-performance fully-pipelined n-select implementations (nS-Root) based on a non-restoring-remainder square root algorithm. The nS-Root uses a parallel array of carry-save adders (CSAs). For a square root bit calculation, a CSA is used once. This means that the calculations can be fully pipelined. It also uses the n-way root-select technique to speedup the square root calculation.

In this context, area-efficiency arguments motivate a heterogeneous organization consisting of few nodes with large caches designed for single-thread parallelism, and a larger number of nodes with smaller caches designed for multi-thread parallelism. Quantitative performance of such organization is reported for a set of homogeneous multiprocessor programs from the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. These programs are mapped onto the heterogeneous processors without source code modifications via static thread assignment policies. Simulation-based analysis is used to compare the performance of heterogeneous and homogeneous DSMs that occupy the same silicon area. The analysis shows that a 4-node heterogeneous DSM with 21 processors outperforms its homogeneous counterpart with 4 processors by an average age of 36% for the studied multiprocessor workload, while having the same performance for sequential codes. A sensitivity analysis based on a factorial design experiment is used to study the implications of processor, memory, and network heterogeneity on overall cost and performance of a heterogeneous DSM. The studied benchmarks are affected, on average, primarily by heterogeneity in processor performance (59.3%), followed by cache sizes (18.2%), memory latency (14.6%), and network latency (5.6%).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture.

On unit-stride vectors, PVA performance equals or exceeds that of an SDRAM system optimized for cache line fills. On vectors with larger strides, the PVA is up to 32.8 times faster. Our design is up to 3.3 times faster than a pipelined, serial SDRAM memory system that gathers sparse vector data, and the gathering mechanism is two to five times faster than in other PVAs with similar goals.

Flit-reservation flow control requires control flits to precede data flits, which can be realized through fast on-chip control wires or the pipelining of control flits one or more cycles ahead of data flits. Scheduling ahead of data at rival enables buffers to be held only during actual buffer usage, unlike existing flow control methods. It also eliminates data latency due to routing and arbitration decisions. Simulations with fast control wires show that flit-reservation flow control extends the 63% throughput attained by virtual-channel flow control with 8 flit buffers per input to 77%, an improvement of 20% with equal storage and bandwidth overheads. Its throughput with 6 buffers (77%) approaches that of virtual-channel flow control using 16 buffers (80%), reflecting the significant buffer savings as a result of efficient buffer utilization. Data latency is also reduced by 15.6% as compared to virtual-channel flow control. The improvement in throughput is similarly realized by the pipelining of each control flit a cycle ahead of their data flits, using control and data networks with the same propagation delay of 1 cycle.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture.

In addition, the ever increasing performance gap between processor and interprocessor communication may further compromise the scalability of these primitives. Ideally, synchronization primitives should provide high performance under both high and low contention without requiring substantial programmer effort and software support. QOLR has been shown to offer substantial speedups and to outperform other synchronization primitives consistently, but at the cost of software support and protocol complexity. This paper proposes the use of speculation and delays to implement a purely hardware-based queueing mechanism called Implicit QOLB. Making use of the pervasiveness of the Load-Linked/Store-Conditional primitives, we present a series of hardware mechanisms to optimize performance for sharing patterns exhibited by locks and associated data. The mechanisms do not require any change to existing software or instruction sets. IQOLB sits alongside the cache-coherence protocol and guides the decisions the protocol makes with respect to lock (and associated data) transfers. Preliminary evaluations indicate that IQOLB may perform as well as, if not better than, QOLB without the additional software and protocol complexity.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture.

These applications, such as image coding, image synthesis and image understanding, require arithmetic rates of up to 10/sup 11/ operations per second. As the number of arithmetic units in a processor increases to meet these demands, register storage and communication between the arithmetic units dominate the area, delay and power of the arithmetic units. In this paper, we show that partitioning the register file along three axes reduces the cost of register storage and communication without significantly impacting performance. We develop a taxonomy of register architectures by partitioning across the data-parallel, instruction-level-parallel and memory-hierarchy axes, and by optimizing the hierarchical register organization for operation on streams of data. Compared to a centralized global register file, the most compact of these organizations reduces the register file area, delay and power dissipation of a media processor by factors of 195, 230 and 430 respectively. This reduction in cost is achieved with a performance degradation of only 8% on a representative set of media processing benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2000.824366","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture.

There is a need for distributed, automated management agents whose behavior also has to dynamically change to reflect the evolution of the system being managed. Policies are a means of specifying and influencing management behavior within a distributed system, without coding the behavior into the manager agents. Our approach is aimed at specifying implementable policies, although policies may be initially specified at the organizational level and then refined to implementable actions. We are concerned with two types of policies. Authorization policies specify what activities a manager is permitted or forbidden to do to a set of target objects and are similar to security access-control policies. Obligation policies specify what activities a manager must or must not do to a set of target objects and essentially define the duties of a manager. Conflicts can arise in the set of policies. Conflicts may also arise during the refinement process between the high level goals and the implementable policies. The system may have to cater for conflicts such as exceptions to normal authorization policies. The paper reviews policy conflicts, focusing on the problems of conflict detection and resolution. We discuss the various precedence relationships that can be established between policies in order to allow inconsistent policies to coexist within the system and present a conflict analysis tool which forms part of a role based management framework.

The medium is patterned with a focused ion beam etching technique on typical present thin film disks. It is found the transition noise is completely absent in the patterned thin film media. Comparing with continuous thin film media, the medium noise is reduced to the level of noise at saturation remnant state and is no longer density-dependent. With the elimination of transition noise, the signal-to-medium-noise ratio will be sufficient at very narrow track widths without further reduction of grain size. A slight increase of intergranular exchange coupling will have little impact on medium noise, but enhance thermal magnetic stability of the medium. Down track orientation of the crystalline easy axes will further improve the recording performances. Position error signal patterns in patterned media can be more versatile and significantly more effective and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/20.824420","startPage":"23","endPage":"29","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17846/00824420.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.824420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recording, noise, and servo characteristics of patterned thin film media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomechanisms","Transistors","Noise reduction","Magnetic noise","Noise level","Grain size","Micromagnetics","Disk recording","Ion beams","Etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic thin film devices","focused ion beam technology","sputter etching","hard discs","magnetic recording noise","grain size"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servo characteristics","patterned thin film media","micromagnetic simulation study","recording noise","position error signal characteristics","focused ion beam etching technique","thin film disks","transition noise","saturation remnant state","signal-to-medium-noise ratio","track widths","grain size","intergranular exchange coupling","thermal magnetic stability","down track orientation","crystalline easy axes","position error signal patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Recording, noise, and servo characteristics of patterned thin film media","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6517035","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recording, noise, and servo characteristics of patterned thin film media","sourcePdf":"00824420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036107S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"54","articleId":"824420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":824422,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The key limiting physical factor is the superparamagnetic effect (thermal stability) in the recording medium. Ambient thermal energy can cause the magnetic signals to decay. The requirement for thermal stability over periods of years dictates a lower limit to the size of magnetic grains (switching units) in the recording medium. To achieve the highest areal densities, it will be necessary to use a magnetic recording configuration capable of writing and storing data on very small magnetic grains together with a signal processing system capable of recovering data reliably when each bit is recorded on very few such grains. In addition to these physical effects, there are a number of practical engineering factors that must be considered: tolerances on the head geometry, reliability of head-disk interface, track-following accuracy. In an example system, we use a perpendicular recording configuration since it appears to offer some advantage in terms of maximizing the number of stable magnetic grains per unit area. The readback signals are processed by equalization to a simple binary eye followed by soft detection of a low-rate simple parity check code. The example system approaches a density of 1 Terabit per square inch and allows 3 dB of margin against thermal decay, adjacent track interference, etc.","doi":"10.1109/20.824422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17846/00824422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.824422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17846","startPage":"36","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The feasibility of magnetic recording at 1 Terabit per square inch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The feasibility of magnetic recording at 1 Terabit per square inch","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6517037","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The feasibility of magnetic recording at 1 Terabit per square inch","sourcePdf":"00824422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036325S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"425","articleId":"824422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824440,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The results for an anisotropy distribution are significantly different from a volume distribution and are in better agreement with the data.

The primary issue in 3D metamorphosis is to establish surface correspondence between the source and target objects, by which each point on the surface of the source object maps to a point on the surface of the target object. Having established this correspondence, we can generate a smooth transition by interpolating corresponding points from the source to the target positions. We handle 3D geometric metamorphosis between two objects represented as triangular meshes. To improve the quality of 3D morphing between two triangular meshes, we particularly consider the following two issues: 1) metamorphosis of arbitrary meshes; 2) metamorphosis with user control. We can address the first issue using our recently proposed method based on harmonic mapping (T. Kanai et al., 1998). In that earlier work, we developed each of the two meshes (topologically equivalent to a disk and having geometrically complicated shapes), into a 2D unit circle by harmonic mapping. Combining those two embeddings produces surface correspondence between the two meshes. However, this method doesn't consider the second issue: how to let the user control surface correspondence. The article develops an effective method for 3D morphing between two arbitrary meshes of the same topology. We extend our previously proposed method to achieve user control of surface correspondence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824544/","volume":"20","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6523313","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Metamorphosis of arbitrary triangular meshes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamorphosis of arbitrary triangular meshes","sourcePdf":"00824544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041396S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isNumber":"17847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"59","articleId":"824544","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824546,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of EEE, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"lastName":"Wei Huang","id":"37362988200"},{"name":"I.

IrDA is cheap to embed, uses unregulated spectrum, and is increasingly pervasive in a wide range of devices. From its roots in portable PCs and printers, IrDA technology is present in virtually all new PDAs, it is emerging in mobile phones, pagers, digital cameras, and image capture devices. We are sitting on the cusp of the information appliance age, and IrDA is playing a significant role in enabling the interaction between information appliances, between information appliances and the information infrastructure, and between appliances communicating across the information infrastructure. This article discusses IrDA's communications model. It charts the evolution of the IrDA-Data (1.x) platform architecture, and the early applications and application services now in common Use. It considers the present day and the explosion in device categories embedding the IrDA platform.

Also, the frequency division CDMA (FD-CDMA) system has been applied to reduce the inter-system interference. From the results, we have known that the capacity of the microcell has diminished with the increase of the number of users, the signal to interference power ratio in the neighboring system, and the ratio of micro and macro cell radius. However, as the distance between the base stations of the microcells is increased, the microcell capacity increases. When it is assumed that the interference signals are dispersed equally at each subband, the applied FD-CDMA technique which has been designed to have capacity flexibility with respect to the traffic variation has improved the capacity up to 50% even if the processing gain of each subband is smaller than that of the W-CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.1999.824610","publicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/6648/17837/00824610.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.1999.824610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17837","startPage":"486","endPage":"490 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimate of uplink capacity in overlaid macrocell/multi-microcell CDMA WLL systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimate of uplink capacity in overlaid macrocell/multi-microcell CDMA WLL systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824610/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6588838","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimate of uplink capacity in overlaid macrocell/multi-microcell CDMA WLL systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00824610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033115S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648","citationCount":"1","articleId":"824610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":824612,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","affiliation":["Mobile Terminal Research & Development Laboratory, LG Information and Communications Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","id":"37065052500"},{"name":"Kwan Cho","affiliation":["Mobile Terminal Research & Development Laboratory, LG Information and Communications Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwan Cho","id":"37067917500"},{"name":"Woong-Rae Cho","affiliation":["Mobile Terminal Research & Development Laboratory, LG Information and Communications Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Woong-Rae Cho","id":"37433637700"},{"name":"Een-Kee Hong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Een-Kee Hong","id":"37354825400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5635-0402-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"824612","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Intelligent networks","Rayleigh channels","Performance analysis","Fading","Multiple access interference","Binary phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Research and development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","radio links","radio networks","cellular radio","channel capacity","multiuser channels","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","radiofrequency interference","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse link synchronous DS-CDMA cellular networks","Rayleigh multipath fading","system capacity","Rayleigh multipath fading channel","other cells interference","synchronous transmission capacity","asynchronous transmission capacity","multiple access interference","handover region","link performance","coherent binary phase shift keying","BPSK data modulation","RAKE combiner","maximal ratio combining","uncode BER"]}],"abstract":"The performance of reverse link synchronous DS-CDMA cellular networks in a Rayleigh multipath fading channel is analyzed to investigate the effect of other cells interference.

For example, consider a multiprocessor system where incoming tasks with exponentially distributed service requirements arrive as a Poisson process, the tasks must choose a processor for service, and a task knows when making this choice the processor queue lengths from T seconds ago. What is a good strategy for choosing a processor in order for tasks to minimize their expected time in the system? Such models can also be used to describe settings where there is a transfer delay between the time a task enters a system and the time it reaches a processor for service. Our models are based on considering the behavior of limiting systems where the number of processors goes to infinity. The limiting systems can be shown to accurately describe the behavior of sufficiently large systems and simulations demonstrate that they are reasonably accurate even for systems with a small number of processors. Our studies of specific models demonstrate the importance of using randomness to break symmetry in these systems and yield important rules of thumb for system design. The most significant result is that only small amounts of queue length information can be extremely useful in these settings; for example, having incoming tasks choose the least loaded of two randomly chosen processors is extremely effective over a large range of possible system parameters. In contrast, using global information can actually degrade performance unless used carefully; for example, unlike most settings where the load information is current, having tasks go to the apparently least loaded server can significantly hurt performance.","doi":"10.1109/71.824633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/17850/00824633.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.824633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How useful is old information?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"How useful is old information?","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6526801","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How useful is old information?","sourcePdf":"00824633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04691S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"99","articleId":"824633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824657,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

The two-step GLRT consists of an initial adaptive matched filter (AMF) test followed by a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Analytical expressions are provided for the probability of false alarm (P/sub FA/) and the probability of detection (P/sub D/) in unknown complex Gaussian interference. The analysis shows that the two-step GLRT significantly reduces the computational load over the GLRT while maintaining detection and sidelobe rejection performance commensurate with the GLRT. The two-step GLRT detection algorithm is also compared with another two-step detection algorithm: the adaptive sidelobe blanker (ASB). Both the two-step GLRT and the ASB are characterized in terms of the mainbeam detection performance and the rejection of sidelobe targets. We demonstrate that for a given P/sub FA/, the two-step GLRT has a broad range of threshold pairs (one threshold for the AMF test and one for the GLRT) that provide performance identical to the GLRT. This is in contrast with the ASB, where the threshold pairs that maximize the P/sub D/ are a function of the target's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Hence, for a fixed pair of thresholds, the two-step GLRT can provide slightly better mainbeam detection performance than the ASB in the transition region from low to high detection probabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","volume":"48","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6534409","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient two-step implementation of the GLRT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient two-step implementation of the GLRT","sourcePdf":"00824657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047699S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","articleId":"824657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":824660,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This viewpoint is based on signal separation principles borrowed from signal processing problems. The received collided packets are not discarded in this approach but are exploited to extract each individual user packet information. In particular, if k users collide in a given time slot, they repeat their transmission for a total of k times so that k copies of the collided packets are received. Then, the receiver has to resolve a k/spl times/k source mixing problem and separate each individual user. The proposed method does not introduce throughput penalties since it requires only k slots to transmit k colliding packets. Performance issues that are related to the implementation of the collision detection algorithm are studied. The protocol's parameters are optimized to maximize the system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/78.824666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17857/00824666.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.824666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-assisted diversity for random access wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824666/","displayDocTitle":"Network-assisted diversity for random access wireless networks","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6534417","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-assisted diversity for random access wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00824666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027532S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"186","articleId":"824666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824672,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

The purpose of this paper is to present an analogous canonical decomposition of the state-covariance matrix of a stable linear filter driven by a given time series. Accordingly, the paper concludes with a modification of MUSIC. The new method starts with filtering the time series and then estimating the covariance of the state of the filter. This step in essence improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by amplifying the contribution to the actual value of the state-covariance of a selected harmonic interval where spectral lines are expected to reside. Then, the method capitalizes on the canonical decomposition of the filter state-covariance to retrieve information on the location of possible spectral lines. The framework requires uniformly spaced samples of the process.","doi":"10.1109/78.824672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.824672","startPage":"780","endPage":"790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17857/00824672.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal estimation via selective harmonic amplification: MUSIC, Redux","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Signal estimation via selective harmonic amplification: MUSIC, Redux","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6534422","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824672/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal estimation via selective harmonic amplification: MUSIC, Redux","sourcePdf":"00824672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034267S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","articleId":"824672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":824673,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

Exploiting this link, it derives a deterministic blind PARAFAC DS-CDMA receiver with performance close to non-blind minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). The proposed PARAFAC receiver capitalizes on code, spatial, and temporal diversity-combining, thereby supporting small sample sizes, more users than sensors, and/or less spreading than users. Interestingly, PARAFAC does not require knowledge of spreading codes, the specifics of multipath (interchip interference), DOA-calibration information, finite alphabet/constant modulus, or statistical independence/whiteness to recover the information-bearing signals. Instead, PARAFAC relies on a fundamental result regarding the uniqueness of low-rank three-way array decomposition due to Kruskal (1977, 1988) (and generalized herein to the complex-valued case) that guarantees identifiability of all relevant signals and propagation parameters. These and other issues are also demonstrated in pertinent simulation experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","volume":"48","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6534425","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind PARAFAC receivers for DS-CDMA systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind PARAFAC receivers for DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00824675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125814S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"387","articleId":"824675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":824677,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Such models arise when a single receiver data from multiple sources is fractionally sampled (assuming that there is excess bandwidth) or when an antenna array is used with or without fractional sampling. We consider estimation of (partial) channel impulse response and design of finite-length minimum mean-square error (MMSE) blind equalizers. The basis of the approach is the design of a zero-forcing equalizer that whitens the noise-free data. We allow infinite impulse response (IIR) channels. Moreover, the multichannel transfer function need not be column reduced. Our approaches also work when the \"subchannel\" transfer functions have common zeros as long as the common zeros are minimum-phase zeros. The channel length or model orders need not be known. The sources are recovered up to a unitary mixing matrix and are further \"unmixed\" using higher order statistics of the data. A linear prediction approach is also considered under the above conditions of possibly IIR channels, common subchannel zeros/factors, and not-necessarily column reduced channels.

To obviate this delay, a new paradigm is emerging based on intellectual property (IP) exchange, where designers and differing companies share subsystems (virtual cores) between themselves to reduce design time to acceptable levels. To this end, over 150 companies including all the major players formed the Virtual Socket Interface Alliance in March 1997. The protection of IP has become a serious issue as intercompany subsystem design exchange becomes more commonplace. This paper presents new techniques to protect the IP of virtual cores that implement digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. The approach involves embedding codewords into the design of fundamental signal processing algorithms such as digital filters and the DFT in such a way that proof of authorship can be retained, and, if required, easily identified. The techniques discussed can be adapted to protect other fundamental DSP algorithms such as convolution and correlation. The protection of IP via watermarking techniques is increasingly being applied at all levels of design. It is particularly advantageous if such techniques are applied at the highest abstraction levels in the design flow, and if such techniques are applied at basic algorithm level, they become very difficult to detect at lower levels of system design.","doi":"10.1109/78.824679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17857/00824679.pdf","startPage":"854","endPage":"861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.824679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP protection of DSP algorithms for system on chip implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824679/","displayDocTitle":"IP protection of DSP algorithms for system on chip implementation","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6534429","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP protection of DSP algorithms for system on chip implementation","sourcePdf":"00824679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047114S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","articleId":"824679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824683,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

Correlations between features can arise when the speech signal is nonstationary or corrupted by noise. We investigate how to model these correlations using factor analysis, a statistical method for dimensionality reduction. Factor analysis uses a small number of parameters to model the covariance structure of high dimensional data. These parameters can be chosen in two ways: (1) to maximize the likelihood of observed speech signals, or (2) to minimize the number of classification errors. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation and a gradient descent algorithm for improved class discrimination. Speech recognizers are evaluated on two tasks, one small-sized vocabulary (connected alpha-digits) and one medium-sized vocabulary (New Jersey town names). We find that modeling feature correlations by factor analysis leads to significantly increased likelihoods and word accuracies. Moreover, the rate of improvement with model size often exceeds that observed in conventional HMM's.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824696.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood and minimum classification error factor analysis for automatic speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/89.824696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood and minimum classification error factor analysis for automatic speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6542422","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood and minimum classification error factor analysis for automatic speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00824696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071165S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"38","articleId":"824696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824697,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Utterance verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR) based hypothesis testing procedure for, verifying individual words in a decoded string. There are two UV techniques that are presented here. The first is a procedure for estimating the parameters of UV models during training according to an optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure used in UV. The second technique is a speech recognition decoding procedure where the \"best\" decoded path is defined to be that which optimizes a LR criterion. These techniques were evaluated in terms of their ability to improve UV performance on a speech dialog task over the public switched telephone network. The results of an experimental study presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found that the use of the LR based decoding procedure, when used in conjunction with models trained using the LR criterion, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of the LR decoder was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in training acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning the formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these techniques with statistical language models used in ASR.","doi":"10.1109/89.824697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","startPage":"126","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utterance verification in continuous speech recognition: decoding and training procedures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utterance verification in continuous speech recognition: decoding and training procedures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6542423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utterance verification in continuous speech recognition: decoding and training procedures","sourcePdf":"00824697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045301S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"39","articleId":"824697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824698,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The only prior knowledge employed by the BAF is that human speech is nonstationary whereas the noise is assumed to be quasistationary, i.e., stationary over a longer interval than that of any speech phoneme. The RAF has a four subsystem structure. The system consists of an identifying subsystem that is followed by a speech/noise parameter-separator. The noise is identified based on the stationary features of speech and noise. A feedforward subsystem sets optimization neighborhood to the virtual feedback subsystem where a cost-functional is minimized to jointly minimize the stationary part of the output while maximizing its nonstationary part. The system has been tested for performance for different signal to noise ratios (SNR) and for different types of noise parameters. Improvements for various noises range from 14-36 dB for -20 dB SNR inputs.","doi":"10.1109/89.824699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824699.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive filtering of speech from noise of unknown spectrum using a virtual feedback configuration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824699/","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive filtering of speech from noise of unknown spectrum using a virtual feedback configuration","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6542425","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive filtering of speech from noise of unknown spectrum using a virtual feedback configuration","sourcePdf":"00824699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039905S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"6","articleId":"824699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":824700,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The noisy speech frames are classified into speech-dominated frames and noise-dominated frames. In the speech-dominated frames, the signal KLT matrix is used and in the noise dominated frames, the noise KLT matrix is used. The approach does not require noise whitening and hence works well even with narrowband noise. A two-dimensional objective measure which captures both the speech distortion and the noise shaping characteristics of the algorithm is proposed. This measure indicates that the proposed method performs better noise shaping than a modified form of the signal subspace approach proposed by Ephraim and Van Trees (1995) and the standard spectral subtraction method. Informal listening tests show that the proposed algorithm does not suffer from the problem of residual musical noise and performs better noise masking than the signal subspace approach.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824700.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"167","doi":"10.1109/89.824700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal/noise KLT based approach for enhancing speech degraded by colored noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Signal/noise KLT based approach for enhancing speech degraded by colored noise","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6542426","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal/noise KLT based approach for enhancing speech degraded by colored noise","sourcePdf":"00824700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063063S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"115","articleId":"824700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":824701,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is shown that the optimum weights obtained for microphone spacing equal to a half wavelength are real, aside from the propagation delay, and inversely proportional to the distance from each microphone to the focal point. When the microphone spacing is less than a half wavelength, the optimum weights are super-directive requiring both an amplitude and phase adjustment in addition to delay-and-sum beamforming. In the super directive regime, the maximum array gain increases as the distance to the focal points decreases. The technique is suitable for applications where the source of interest is located in the near-field region but interfering sources are located farther from the array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6542428","displayDocTitle":"Array optimization applied in the near field of a microphone array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array optimization applied in the near field of a microphone array","sourcePdf":"00824702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027417S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"49","articleId":"824702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":824704,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The mesh can be used for simulation of two- and three-dimensional (3-D) wave propagation in musical instruments and acoustic spaces. The original rectangular digital waveguide mesh algorithm suffers from direction-dependent dispersion. Alternative geometries, such as the triangular mesh, have been proposed previously to improve the performance of the mesh. In this paper, we show that the dispersion problem may be reduced using various other techniques. These methods include multidimensional interpolation, optimization of the point-spreading function, and frequency warping. We compare the accuracy and computational complexity of these techniques in the two-dimensional (2-D) case and conduct numerical simulations of a membrane. A rectangular mesh using second-order Lagrange interpolation can be implemented without multiplications, but its accuracy is worse than that of other enhanced structures. The most accurate technique in terms of the relative frequency error is the warped triangular mesh whose maximum error is 0.6%. The warped rectangular mesh with optimized weighting coefficients is not as exact, but still offers a 1.2% accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/89.824704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824704.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","startPage":"184","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the dispersion error in the digital waveguide mesh using interpolation and frequency-warping techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the dispersion error in the digital waveguide mesh using interpolation and frequency-warping techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6542430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the dispersion error in the digital waveguide mesh using interpolation and frequency-warping techniques","sourcePdf":"00824704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04599S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"46","articleId":"824704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":824706,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Scienceand Information Systems, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Qiang Huo","id":"38521947900"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications Research Laboratory, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Hui Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"824706","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian predictive classification approach to robust speech recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17856/00824706.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.824706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17856","doi":"10.1109/89.824706","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Speech recognition","Testing","Automatic speech recognition","Decoding","Parameter estimation","Noise robustness","Uncertainty","Additive white noise","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","prediction theory","signal classification","speech recognition","AWGN","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate Bayesian predictive classification","robust speech recognition","decision strategy","testing conditions","training conditions","quasi-Bayes predictive classification","experiments","additive white Gaussian noise","plug-in MAP decision rule","AWGN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824706","abstract":"We introduce a new decision strategy called Bayesian predictive classification (BPC) for robust speech recognition where an unknown mismatch between the training and testing conditions exists.

The devices fabricated using this technology have an ultra-thin channel region (300 /spl Aring/) and a thick drain/source region (3000 /spl Aring/). The ultra-thin channel region is connected to the heavily doped thick drain/source region through a lightly doped overlapped region. The ultra-thin channel region is used to obtain a low grain-boundary trap density in the channel, and the overlapped lightly doped region provides an effective way for electric field spreading at the drain, thereby reducing the electric field there significantly. With the low grain-boundary trap density and low drain electric field, excellent current saturation characteristics and high drain breakdown voltage are obtained in the UT-ECTFT. Moreover, this technology provides complementary LTPS TFT's with more than two times increase in on-current and 3.5 times reduction in off-current compared to conventional thick channel LTPS TFT's.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-thin elevated channel poly-Si TFT technology for fully-integrated AMLCD system on glass","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.824731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/17855/00824731.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.824731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-thin elevated channel poly-Si TFT technology for fully-integrated AMLCD system on glass","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6540355","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-thin elevated channel poly-Si TFT technology for fully-integrated AMLCD system on glass","sourcePdf":"00824731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050791S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"70","articleId":"824731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824742,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The paper presents a methodology to automatically perform these two steps in conjunction using a three-phase approach to construct a fuzzy system from numerical data. Phase 1 outlines the membership functions and system rules for a specific structure, starting from a very simple initial topology. Phase 2 decides a new and more suitable topology with the information received from the previous step; it determines for which variable the number of fuzzy sets used to discretize the domain must be increased and where these new fuzzy sets should be located. This, in turn, decides in a dynamic way in which part of the input space the number of fuzzy rules should be increased. Phase 3 selects from the different structures obtained to construct a fuzzy system the one providing the best compromise between the accuracy of the approximation and the complexity of the rule set. The accuracy and complexity of the fuzzy system derived by the proposed self-organized fuzzy rule generation procedure (SOFRG) are studied for the problem of function approximation.

A unified and systematic procedure is employed to derive the controllers for both holonomic and nonholonomic mechanical control systems, respectively. First, a fuzzy logic system is introduced to learn the behavior of unknown (or uncertain) mechanical dynamics by using an adaptive algorithm. Next, the effect of approximation error on the tracking error must be efficiently eliminated by employing an additional robustifying algorithm. Consequently, hybrid adaptive-robust controllers can be constructed such that the resulting closed-loop mechanical systems guarantee a satisfactorily transient and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, a partitioned procedure with respect to the above developed adaptive fuzzy logic approximators is introduced such that the number of fuzzy IF-THEN rules is significantly reduced and the developed control schemes can be easily implemented from the viewpoint of practical applications. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the tracking performance of a two-link constrained robot manipulator and a vertical wheel rolling on a plane surface by the proposed adaptive fuzzy-based control algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/91.824768","startPage":"46","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/17853/00824768.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.824768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tracking designs for both holonomic and nonholonomic constrained mechanical systems: adaptive fuzzy approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Mechanical systems","Control systems","Fuzzy logic","Control design","Uncertainty","Adaptive algorithm","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","adaptive control","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","tracking","fuzzy logic","dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking designs","nonholonomic constrained mechanical systems","holonomic constrained mechanical systems","adaptive fuzzy approach","adaptive fuzzy-based tracking control designs","fuzzy logic system","approximation error","tracking error","hybrid adaptive-robust controllers","fuzzy IF-THEN rules","two-link constrained robot manipulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Robust tracking designs for both holonomic and nonholonomic constrained mechanical systems: adaptive fuzzy approach","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6535226","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tracking designs for both holonomic and nonholonomic constrained mechanical systems: adaptive fuzzy approach","sourcePdf":"00824768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066784S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"93","articleId":"824768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":824772,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mohamed","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37285983400"},{"name":"P.

The proposed controller utilizes the robust adaptive control to guarantee uniform boundedness and convergence of tracking errors. In addition, an adaptive fuzzy logic system is used as a universal approximator to reduce the model uncertainties coming from uncertain nonlinearities and to improve tracking performance. The approach does not require the matching condition imposed on control systems by using the backstepping design procedure, and provides boundedness of tracking errors under poor parameter adaptation.

Yet such sources will provide a significant portion of traffic in future networks, and will significantly affect the overall performance of and quality of service. Clearly high levels of compression are desirable as long as video quality remains satisfactory, and our research addresses this key issue with a novel learning-based approach. We propose the use of neural networks (NNs) as post-processors for any existing video compression scheme. The approach is to interpolate video sequences and compensate for frames which may have been lost or deliberately dropped. We show that deliberately dropping frames will significantly reduce the amount of offered traffic in the network, and hence the cell loss probability and network congestion, while the NN post-processor will preserve most of the desired video quality. Dropping frames at the sender or in the network is also a fast way to react to network overload and reduce congestion. Our interpolation techniques at the receiver, including neural network-based algorithms, provide output frame rates which are identical to (or possibly higher than) the original video sequence's frame rate. The resulting video quality is essentially equivalent to the sequence without frame drops, despite the loss of a significant fraction of the frames. Experimental evaluation using real video sequences is provided or interpolation with a connectionist NN using the backpropagation learning algorithm, the random NN (RNN) in a feed-forward configuration with its associated learning algorithm, and cubic spline interpolation. The experiments show that when more frames are being dropped or lost, the RNN performs generally better than the other techniques in terms of resulting video quality and overall performance. When the fraction of dropped frames is small, cubic splines offer better performance. Experimental data shows that this receiver-reconstructed subsampling technique significantly reduces the cell loss rates in an asynchronous transfer mode switch for different buffer sizes and service rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6539307","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Video quality and traffic QoS in learning-based subsampled and receiver-interpolated video sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video quality and traffic QoS in learning-based subsampled and receiver-interpolated video sequences","sourcePdf":"00824788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151544S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","articleId":"824788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":824797,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The problem of maximizing the average value of admitted calls per unit time (or of revenue maximization) is naturally formulated as a dynamic programming problem, but is too complex to allow for an exact solution. We use methods of neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) [reinforcement learning (RL)], together with a decomposition approach, to construct dynamic (state-dependent) call admission control and routing policies. These policies are based on state-dependent link costs, and a simulation-based learning method is employed to tune the parameters that define these link costs. A broad set of experiments shows the robustness of our policy and compares its performance with a commonly used heuristic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17852/00824797.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.824797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.824797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call admission control and routing in integrated services networks using neuro-dynamic programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Call admission control","Routing","Intelligent networks","Intserv networks","Dynamic programming","Bandwidth","Costs","Communication system control","Laboratories","Learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication services","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication congestion control","dynamic programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","telecommunication computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic call admission control","call routing","integrated services networks","neuro-dynamic programming","resource requirements","call classes","dynamic programming problem","revenue maximization","admitted calls per unit time maximization","reinforcement learning","decomposition approach","state-dependent call admission control","state-dependent link costs","simulation-based learning method","experiments","performance","heuristic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Call admission control and routing in integrated services networks using neuro-dynamic programming","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6539310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call admission control and routing in integrated services networks using neuro-dynamic programming","sourcePdf":"00824797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043636S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"89","articleId":"824797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824799,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Tong","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Hui Tong","id":"37433277700"},{"name":"T.X.

In the case of a multimedia call, each of its substreams (i.e., video, audio, and data) has its own distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., cell loss rate, delay, jitter, etc.). The network attempts to deliver the required QoS by allocating an appropriate amount of resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers). The negotiated QoS requirements constitute a certain QoS level that remains fixed during the call (static allocation approach). Accordingly, the corresponding allocated resources also remain unchanged. We present and analyze an adaptive allocation of resources algorithm based on genetic algorithms. In contrast to the static approach, each substream declares a preset range of acceptable QoS levels (e.g., high, medium, low) instead of just a single one. As the availability of resources in the wireless network varies, the algorithm selects the best possible QoS level that each substream can obtain. In case of congestion, the algorithm attempts to free up some resources by degrading the QoS levels of the existing calls to lesser ones. This is done, however, under the constraint of achieving maximum utilization of the resources while simultaneously distributing them fairly among the calls. The degradation is limited to a minimum value predefined in a user-defined profile (UDP). Genetic algorithms have been used to solve the optimization problem. From the user perspective, the perception of the QoS degradation is very graceful and happens only during overload periods. The network services, on the other hand, are greatly enhanced due to the fact that the call blocking probability is significantly decreased. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of increasing the number of admitted calls while utilizing the available bandwidth fairly and effectively.","doi":"10.1109/49.824812","startPage":"268","endPage":"282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in

multiple access (DS-CDMA/FRMA) cellular networks. The fuzzy/neural congestion controller is constituted by a pipeline recurrent neural network (PRNN) interference predictor, a fuzzy performance indicator, and a fuzzy/neural access probability controller. It regulates the traffic input to the integrated voice and data DS-CDMA/FRMA cellular system by determining proper access probabilities for users so that congestion can be avoided and the throughput can be maximized. Simulation results show that the DS-CDMA/FRMA fuzzy/neural congestion controllers perform better than conventional DS-CDMA/PRMA with channel access function in terms of voice packet dropping ratio, corruption ratio, and utilization. In addition, the neural congestion controller outperforms the fuzzy congestion controller.","doi":"10.1109/49.824814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17852/00824814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.824814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17852","startPage":"283","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy/neural congestion control for integrated voice and data DS-CDMA/FRMA cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy/neural congestion control for integrated voice and data DS-CDMA/FRMA cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6539317","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy/neural congestion control for integrated voice and data DS-CDMA/FRMA cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00824814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067443S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","articleId":"824814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":824819,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6525225","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical pattern recognition: a review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical pattern recognition: a review","sourcePdf":"00824819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116003S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"3806","articleId":"824819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":824820,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered.

The principle driving application for this technology is \"fourth generation\" embedded computing: \"smart\" environments and portable or wearable devices. The key technical goals are to determine the computer's context with respect to nearby humans (e.g., who, what, when, where, and why) so that the computer can act or respond appropriately without detailed instructions. The paper examines the mathematical tools that have proven successful, provides a taxonomy of the problem domain, and then examines the state of the art. Four areas receive particular attention: person identification, surveillance/monitoring, 3D methods, and smart rooms/perceptual user interfaces. Finally, the paper discusses some of the research challenges and opportunities.","doi":"10.1109/34.824823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17859/00824823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.824823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17859","startPage":"107","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Looking at people: sensing for ubiquitous and wearable computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Looking at people: sensing for ubiquitous and wearable computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6525229","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Looking at people: sensing for ubiquitous and wearable computing","sourcePdf":"00824823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090775S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"253","articleId":"824823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824928,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Peng Cheng","affiliation":["Nanjing Institute of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yun Peng Cheng","id":"37279570000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5635-0402-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"824928","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Delay estimation","Robustness","Multiaccess communication","AWGN","Multiple signal classification","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","delay estimation","bandlimited communication","signal processing","search problems","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user recognition algorithm","time delay estimation","near far robustness","asynchronous bandlimited DS-CDMA systems","subspace concept","preprocessing","postprocessing","noise subspace estimation","signature codes","efficient search strategy","simulations","near far resistant algorithm","TDE accuracy"]}],"abstract":"An algorithm for user recognition and time delay estimation (UR/TDE) in an asynchronous bandlimited DS-CDMA system in a near far scenario is presented.

If a user is active, an initial and coarse TDE is available, and the following postprocessing is needed, which is designed to get a fine estimation by an efficient search strategy for active users.

While the conventional fixed-step power control scheme is difficult to compensate the fast fading channel dynamically, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) based power controller is proposed to smoothen out the fast fading and keep the received signal power from each user constant at the base station. Simulation results show that the FNN power controller achieves better traffic capacity and control performance than a fixed-step controller due to the inherent ability of FNN to identify the fast time-varying characteristic of the inverse channel. Furthermore, the FNN scheme is suitable for on-line system identification and adaptive control by neural network training.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.1999.824958","publicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/6648/17837/00824958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.1999.824958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17837","startPage":"608","endPage":"611 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive power control on the reverse link for CDMA cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive power control on the reverse link for CDMA cellular system","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824958/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6588867","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive power control on the reverse link for CDMA cellular system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00824958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051167S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648","citationCount":"5","articleId":"824958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":824966,"authors":[{"name":"Char-Dir Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

By splitting the standard OFDM complex signals into real and imaginary sections, the proposed approach employs phase modulation in conjunction with signal clipping to endow the transmitted signal with a constant envelope, without destroying the required transmission characteristic associated with OFDM. The resultant constant-envelope signal enables the operation of the transmitter's power amplifier at the saturation point and thus maximizes the achievable power efficiency. Despite the constant-envelope advantage, half the bandwidth efficiency is traded off by the approach. It is shown by simulation that the bit error performance of the proposed system is only slightly degraded from the conventional OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/6648/17837/00824966.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"632 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","doi":"10.1109/APCC.1999.824966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.1999.824966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Power amplifiers","Phase modulation","AWGN","Transmitters","Bandwidth","Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","Frequency division multiplexing","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","telecommunication signalling","phase modulation","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant-envelope OFDM modulation","constant-envelope signaling","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM complex signals","phase modulation","signal clipping","transmission characteristic","constant-envelope signal","transmitter power amplifier","saturation point operation","power efficiency","bandwidth","simulation","bit error performance","AWGN channel","bit error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Constant-envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6588872","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00824966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023943S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648","citationCount":"10","articleId":"824966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":824967,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Yi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Sun Yi","id":"37435271600"},{"name":"Zhou Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Sheng","id":"37433363300"},{"name":"Wu Weiling","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Weiling","id":"37266423000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5635-0402-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"824967","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"Firstly, the paper describes two channel estimation methods adopted in the downlink and uplink channels of WCDMA systems: pilot channel and pilot symbol group.

We have derived the p.d.f of the amplitude of the composite interference. And then we have evaluated the performance of a 16QAM system in a composite interference environment. From the results, it is known that when the impulse type interference is weaker than the others, the shape of the p.d.f is dominantly governed by the power component ratio of sinusoidal and rectangular type interference. On the other hand, when the impulse type interference is stronger, the effect of the other two interferences becomes insignificant. Also, it is shown that the smaller both the impulsive index (A) and the mean power component ratio (/spl Gamma/') in impulse type interference are, the worse the performance of the 16QAM system is.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.1999.824982","publicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/6648/17837/00824982.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"653 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.1999.824982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of 16QAM system in a composite electromagnetic interference environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824982/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of 16QAM system in a composite electromagnetic interference environment","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6588877","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of 16QAM system in a composite electromagnetic interference environment","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00824982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033063S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648","articleId":"824982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":824983,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yi Wang","id":"37293663700"},{"name":"Hong Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hong Zhang","id":"37441394500"},{"name":"Welling Wu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Welling Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5635-0402-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"824983","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"A simple blind adaptive receiver structure is proposed in this paper, in which each user needs only one linear filter. The blind adaptive algorithm based on the subspace method comprises of two parts: subspace tracking and channel estimation, and needs the knowledge of only the signature waveform and timing of the first path of the desired user. In the channel estimation part, a novel algorithm is proposed, whose computational complexity is lower that in Wang and Poor (1998). Simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can quickly and accurately estimate the channel in the case of knowing the timing of each path. In the case of knowing only the information of the timing of the first path, the steady state performance of the algorithm decreases. However, the corruption contributes little to the system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/6648/17837/00824983.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"656 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on ... and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference on Communications,","doi":"10.1109/APCC.1999.824983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.1999.824983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=824983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple blind adaptive receiver in multipath CDMA channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Timing","Channel estimation","Adaptive filters","Nonlinear filters","Adaptive algorithm","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Steady-state","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","tracking","computational complexity","fading channels","multipath channels","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive receiver","multipath CDMA channels","linear filter","subspace method","subspace tracking","channel estimation","signature waveform","first path","computational complexity","timing","steady state performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/824983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A simple blind adaptive receiver in multipath CDMA channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6588878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple blind adaptive receiver in multipath CDMA channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00824983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02694S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"17837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648","articleId":"824983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":824985,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Ping","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Ping","id":"37271426500"},{"name":"Bai Chunlong","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Bai Chunlong","id":"37444720500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-5635-0402-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"824985","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Modulation coding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Data communication","Performance gain","Jitter","Digital modulation","Error correction","Biorthogonal modulation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","cellular radio","trellis coded modulation","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MTCM","CDMA cellular systems","multiple trellis coding","biorthogonal sequence modulation","high-speed rate data transmission","coding gain","complexity","data rate","phase jitter sensitivity","performance","fading channel"]}],"abstract":"Multiple trellis coding containing with biorthogonal sequence modulation, and the application of this scheme to CDMA cellular systems for high-speed rate data transmission are presented in this paper.

The supply chain is one such example. However, because of the high communication cost and the long network delay, information may be delayed and thus incorrect. Delayed information will affect the quality of decision making and the productivity of the system. An artificial neural network approach has been adopted in many forecasting applications and has proved to be very useful. We propose an artificial neural network approach for predicting the correct information from the delayed information in the supply chain. In this approach, a multilayer feedforward network trained by standard backpropagation is employed to realize the relationship between the delayed information and the correct information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, a simplified supply chain system is simulated and the effects of delayed demand information are examined. We compare our approach with the no-prediction approach and the perfect-prediction approach. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the no-prediction approach. Our approach exhibits comparable performance to the perfect-prediction approach when there is a small delay.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.825209","startPage":"66","endPage":"70 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Systems that are apt to chaotic behavior must possess the main properties: non-linearity, openness as a system, multicomponentness, evolutionism and randomness. In such systems, even a slight change in initial conditions could cause it to evolve into a new macroscopic structure or, in other words, a cooperative mode discovered under fluctuations. The significance of asymmetry and non-linearity, which were increased on introducing a restricted N-shaped synaptic relation in a two-mode dynamic model, is emphasized. Population dynamics, economics, weather and financial market forecasting possess these properties. Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems is almost impossible because a small error can amplify itself over time to cause a new quality of events. Short-term forecasting of chaotic systems can easily realized, moreover chaos is a catalyst in the learning of artificial neural systems. An improved neural network computational algorithm linked with the kernel function approach and the recursive prediction error method has been developed and applied to stock market time series forecasting. The main idea of neural network learning by the kernel function is that this function stimulates changes to weights to achieve convergence of desired and forecast output functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.825335","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17632/00825335.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"643 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The result of our FTA reveals three main factors which lead to hazardous situations, the factors being human errors, abnormal robot motions, and outsiders entrance. Based on the FTA, we develop fail-safe analog circuits (FSAC's) which are effectively used in a parallel process of dual signal lines starting from two kinds of dual sensor signals (dual force sensor signals as well as dual joint sensor signals) and ending up with an FSAC which allows one of the dual analog control signals to pass through the gate only when they were checked the same with acceptable deviation, for the purpose of enhancing the diagnostic capability in 1 out of 2 logic. We equip the robot with mechanical safeguarding measures, a sphere-shaped joint, mechanical stoppers, and viscoelastic coverings to eliminate all hazardous parts around the robot links. Then, we claim that human intention becomes a very important factor when the robot is equipped with a tool/work which is hazardous, and propose to provide the robot with a function of inferring human-intended path patterns using a modified HMM. We also demonstrate that human/robot intention mismatch leads the robot to making an emergency stop.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.825409","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The footprints of most pulsed power accelerators are large, making them incompatible for applications that require either portability or a large number of similar components for very high power devices (like Z-pinch accelerators). Most of the modern pulsed power accelerators require several stages of pulse conditioning (pulse forming) to convert the multimicrosecond pulse of a Marx generator output to the 50-100 ns pulse required for an electron or ion diode or a cell cavity of an inductive voltage adder. The authors propose a new method for constructing high-current, high-voltage pulsed accelerators. The salient future of the approach is switching and inductively adding the pulses at low voltage straight out of the capacitors through low inductance transfer and soft iron core isolation. High currents can be achieved by feeding each core with many capacitors connected in parallel in a circular array. High voltage is obtained by inductively adding many stages in series. Utilizing the presently available capacitors and switches we can build a 300 kA, 7 MV generator with an overall outer diameter (including capacitors and switches) of 1.2 m and length of 6.5 m. In addition, the authors' accelerator can be multipulsed with a repetition rate up to the capacitor specifications and no less than 10 Hz.

The proposed multiplier implementation on a PCI initiator/target interface card (where a single chip design, XC4010E, is used to implement a PCI local bus interface, revision 2.1, protocol and timing compliance) is demonstrated. The flexible design of the PCI-interface can be easily adapted for specific interface requirements. This interface card can be used for different DSP applications. The multiplier is compared with one proposed recently in terms of speed and hardware, and is shown to be faster (for large multipliers, it tends to provide double speed), and having a lower area x time/sup 2/ complexity. An implementation using a FPGA-based PCI-interface card has been made for an 8/spl times/8 multiplier. The design was tested using simulation software.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Application software","Clocks","Logic design","Design engineering","Cities and towns","Algorithm design and analysis","Chip scale packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits","protocols","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","two's complement serial-parallel multiplier","PCI interface","modified Booth algorithm","initiator/target interface card","local bus interface","protocol","timing compliance","interface requirements","DSP applications","simulation software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825558","doi":"10.1109/ICM.1998.825558","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Microelectronics (Cat.

These needs will grow further as new real-time multimedia applications become more feasible and pervasive. Currently, there is no other technology on the horizon that can effectively meet such a demand for bandwidth in the transport infrastructure other than WDM technology. This technology enables incremental and quick provisioning up to and beyond two orders of magnitude of today's fiber bandwidth levels. This precludes the need to deploy additional cabling and having to contend with right-of-way issues, a key advantage. Hence, it is only natural that over time optical/WDM technology will migrate closer to the end users, from core to regional, metropolitan, and ultimately access networks. At present, WDM deployment is mostly point-to-point and uses SONET/SDH as the standard layer for interfacing to the higher layers of the protocol stack. However, large-scale efforts are underway to develop standards and products that will eliminate one or more of these intermediate layers (e.g., SONET/SDH, ATM) and run IP directly over the WDM layer. IP over WDM has been envisioned as the winning combination due to the ability of the IP to be the common revenue-generating convergence sublayer and WDM as a bandwidth-rich transport sublayer. Various important concerns still need to be addressed regarding IP-WDM integration. These include lightpath routing coupled with tighter interworkings with IP routing and resource management protocols, survivability provisioning, framing/monitoring solutions, and others.","doi":"10.1109/35.825644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17868/00825644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.825644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17868","startPage":"72","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On IP-over-WDM integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On IP-over-WDM integration","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6532829","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On IP-over-WDM integration","sourcePdf":"00825644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039967S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"139","articleId":"825644","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825645,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.H.

We offer an overview of the enabling technologies and extend the treatment to the network application of these converters. Attention is given to semiconductor optical amplifiers and their use in wavelength converters. Converters based on four-wave mixing as well as those based on nonlinear optical loop mirrors are evaluated, paying special attention to signal integrity and architectural as well as performance issues. The use of wavelength converters in wavelength routing networks is explored together with the application of these devices in contention resolution and in the routing wavelength assignment problem.

These chip improvements, in turn, have been stoked by steady progress in semiconductor process technology, which, as Moore's law predicts, doubles IC transistor counts every 18 months. Supporting this progress is the infrastructure provided by design tools, which today, however, comes up short against the process advances crucial to tomorrow's chips. Why? Because present design tools and methodologies presuppose that chip performance is determined by the transistor. That supposition may have been true a few years ago, but no more. Chip performance now depends on the interconnect. The new significance of interconnect performance is driving changes throughout the logic design flow because logic synthesis engines and other tools assume that timing can be predicted before the physical layout is done. But pre-layout and post-layout timing values no longer converge, and design tools must evolve to match this change in process technology. The first step is for vendors to create tools that accurately predict the performance of designs in this interconnect-dominated technology. The author discusses the importance of timing, 2D and 3D modelling of the interconnects, and deep submicron effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6532767","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the wiring of deep submicron ICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the wiring of deep submicron ICs","sourcePdf":"0300-0653Interconnectlo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049104S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"11","articleId":"825662","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825668,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The Binary-translation Optimized Architecture (BOA), an implementation of the IBM PowerPC family, combines binary translation with dynamic optimization. The authors use these techniques to simplify the hardware by bridging a semantic gap between the PowerPC's reduced instruction set and even simpler hardware primitives. Processors like the Pentium Pro and Power4 have tried to achieve high frequency and ILP by implementing a cracking scheme in hardware: an instruction decoder in the pipeline generates multiple micro-operations that can then be scheduled out of order.

The camera position and orientation for all views, the 3-D shape of the rigid object, as well as the associated color information, are recovered from the image sequence. The system proceeds in four steps. First, the internal camera parameters describing the imaging geometry are calibrated using a reference object. Second, an initial 3-D description of the object is computed from two views. This model information is then used in a third step to estimate the camera positions for all available views using a novel linear 3-D motion and shape estimation algorithm. The main feature of this third step is the simultaneous estimation of 3-D camera-motion parameters and object shape refinement with respect to the initial 3-D model. The initial 3-D shape model exhibits only a few degrees of freedom and the object shape refinement is defined as flexible deformation of the initial shape model. Our formulation of the shape deformation allows the object texture to slide on the surface, which differs from traditional flexible body modeling. This novel combined shape and motion estimation using sliding texture considerably improves the calibration data of the individual views in comparison to fixed-shape model based camera-motion estimation. Since the shape model used for model based camera-motion estimation is only approximate, a volumetric 3-D reconstruction process is initiated in the fourth step that combines the information from ail views simultaneously. The recovered object consists of a set of voxels with associated color information that describes even fine structures and details of the object. New views of the object can be rendered from the recovered 3-D model, which has potential applications in virtual reality or multimedia systems and the emerging field of video coding using 3-D scene models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.825726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17874/00825726.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"277","doi":"10.1109/76.825726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic reconstruction of stationary 3-D objects from multiple uncalibrated camera views","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Automatic reconstruction of stationary 3-D objects from multiple uncalibrated camera views","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6541844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic reconstruction of stationary 3-D objects from multiple uncalibrated camera views","sourcePdf":"00825726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103507S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"42","articleId":"825726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":825736,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Flash-1 is modular and adaptive and operates in parallel computing environments. It was designed to let users configure initial and boundary conditions, change algorithms, and add new physical effects with minimal effort. It uses the Paramesh library to manage a block-structured adaptive grid, placing resolution elements only where needed most.

A prior knowledge of the manufactured object shadow shape is captured by a prototype template, along with a set of admissible linear transformations, to take into account the shape variability. Then, the classification problem is defined as a two-step process: 1) the detection problem of a region of interest in the input image is stated as the minimization of a cost function; and 2) the value of this function at convergence allows one to determine whether the desired object is present or not in the sonar image. The energy minimization problem is tackled using relaxation techniques. In this context, we compare the results obtained with a deterministic relaxation technique and two stochastic relaxation methods: simulated annealing and a hybrid genetic algorithm. This latter method has been successfully tested on real and synthetic sonar images, yielding very promising results.","doi":"10.1109/34.825752","startPage":"129","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.825752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17881/00825752.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid genetic optimization and statistical model based approach for the classification of shadow shapes in sonar imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825752/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid genetic optimization and statistical model based approach for the classification of shadow shapes in sonar imagery","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6540526","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid genetic optimization and statistical model based approach for the classification of shadow shapes in sonar imagery","sourcePdf":"00825752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044488S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"50","articleId":"825752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":825753,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A multiscale representation of the texture image, generated by a multiband smoothing algorithm based on human psychophysical measurements of color appearance is used as the input. Initial segmentation is achieved by applying a clustering algorithm to the image at the coarsest level of smoothing. The segmented clusters are then restructured in order to isolate core clusters, i.e., patches in which the pixels are definitely associated with the same region. The image pixels representing the core clusters are used to form 3D color histograms which are then used for probabilistic assignment of all other pixels to the core clusters to form larger clusters and categorise the rest of the image. The process of setting up color histograms and probabilistic reassignment of the pixels to the clusters is then propagated through finer levels of smoothing until a full segmentation is achieved at the highest level of resolution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6540527","volume":"22","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of color textures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of color textures","sourcePdf":"00825753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047388S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"142","articleId":"825753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825759,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In our approach, several neural networks are first selected based on which works best for each class in terms of minimizing classification errors.

In this approach, the minimum classification error criterion is utilized to estimate the optimal linear weights. In this formulation, because the classification decision rule is incorporated into the cost function, a more suitable better combination of weights for the classification objective could be obtained. Experimental results using artificial and real data sets show that the proposed method can construct a better combined classifier that outperforms the best single classifier in terms of overall classification errors for test data.","doi":"10.1109/34.825759","startPage":"207","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.825759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17881/00825759.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal linear combination of neural networks for improving classification performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825759/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal linear combination of neural networks for improving classification performance","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6540531","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal linear combination of neural networks for improving classification performance","sourcePdf":"00825759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056628S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"151","articleId":"825759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":825770,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

Both bonding processes can achieve bonding strength comparable to the fracture toughness of bulk silicon in less than 5 min. Without using global heating furnaces, localized bonding process is conducted in the common environment of room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Although these processes are accomplished within a confined bonding region and under high temperature, the substrate temperature remains low.

Two freestanding polysilicon clamps, each suspended by a pair of microbeams, hold each end of a heart cell. When the cell contracts, the beam bend and force is determined from the measured deflection and the spring constant in the beams. The average maximal force over seven contractile experiments using a calcium solution stimulus was F/sub max/=12.6/spl plusmn/4.66 /spl mu/N. Normalizing to a cross-sectional area, F/sub max//area was 23.7/spl plusmn/8.6 mN/mm/sup 2/. These force data were also correlated to optically imaged striation pattern periodicity. Intermediate forces were also measured in response to a calcium solution gradient and showed similar behavior to those measured in other laboratories.

The diamond AFM probe was fabricated by combining selective deposition for patterning a diamond cantilever with a mold technique on an Si substrate for producing a pyramidal diamond tip. The cantilever was then released by removing the substrate. We report the initial results obtained in AFM measurements taken using the fabricated diamond probe. These results indicate that this diamond probe is capable of measuring AFM images. In addition, we have developed the anodic bonding of diamond thin film to glass using Al or Ti film as an intermediate layer for assembly.

Design variations have been investigated, but commercial devices have generally maintained a consistent topology with incremental improvements. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to the design and construction of this device that offers functional and manufacturing advantages. Piezoresistive accelerometers are described that combine deep reactive ion etching and oblique ion implantation to form self-caging proof masses and flexures with vertical sidewalls and sidewall piezoresistive strain sensors. These devices deflect in-plane rather than out-of-plane, which allows one to form multiaxis accelerometers on one substrate. Performance is comparable to inexpensive commercial capacitive accelerometers and is limited by 1/f noise. The design, fabrication, and experimental characterization is presented. This new topology provides the foundation for a new category of piezoresistive accelerometers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6541903","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance planar piezoresistive accelerometer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance planar piezoresistive accelerometer","sourcePdf":"00825778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04557S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"131","articleId":"825778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":825780,"authors":[{"name":"B.-H.

The process allows for the stacking of many thin (less than 100-/spl mu/m thick) patterned PDMS layers to realize complex 3-D channel paths. The master for each layer is formed on a silicon wafer using an epoxy-based photoresist (SU 8). PDMS is cast against the master producing molded layers containing channels and openings. To realize thin layers with openings, a sandwich molding configuration was developed that allows precise control of the PDMS thickness. The master wafer is clamped within a sandwich that includes flat aluminum plates, a flexible polyester film layer, a rigid Pyrex wafer, and a rubber sheet. A parametric study is performed on PDMS surface activation in a reactive-ion-etching system and the subsequent methanol treatment for bonding and aligning very thin individual components to a substrate. Low RF power and short treatment times are better than high RF power and long treatment times, respectively, for instant bonding. Layer-to-layer alignment of less then 15 /spl mu/m is achieved with manual alignment techniques that utilize surface tension driven self-alignment methods. A coring procedure is used to realize off-chip fluidic connections via the bottom PDMS layer, allowing the top layer to remain smooth and flat for complete optical access.","doi":"10.1109/84.825780","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/17875/00825780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.825780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional micro-channel fabrication in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Radio frequency","Stacking","Silicon","Resists","Thickness control","Aluminum","Rubber","Parametric study","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastomers","micromachining","microfluidics","photoresists","moulding","sputter etching","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional micro-channel fabrication","polydimethylsiloxane","PDMS elastomer","stacking","complex 3-D channel paths","silicon wafer","epoxy-based photoresist","molded layers","sandwich molding configuration","flexible polyester film layer","rigid Pyrex wafer","rubber sheet","parametric study","surface activation","reactive-ion-etching system","methanol treatment","bonding","layer-to-layer alignment","surface tension driven self-alignment methods","coring procedure","off-chip fluidic connections","Si","Al"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional micro-channel fabrication in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6541905","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825780/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional micro-channel fabrication in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer","sourcePdf":"00825780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044976S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"835","articleId":"825780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825783,"authors":[{"name":"M.J. de Boer","affiliation":["Micromechanical Transducers Group, MESA Research Institute, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"M.J.","lastName":"de Boer","id":"37317898800"},{"name":"R.W.

A fundamental limit to the detection of small forces is imposed by thermomechanical noise, the mechanical analog of Johnson noise, which is governed by dissipation of mechanical energy. This paper reports on measurements of the mechanical quality factor Q for arrays of silicon-nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon cantilevers. By studying the dependence of Q on cantilever material, geometry, and surface treatments, significant insight into dissipation mechanisms has been obtained. For submicron-thick cantilevers, Q is found to decrease with decreasing cantilever thickness, indicating surface loss mechanisms. For single-crystal silicon cantilevers, significant increase in room temperature Q is obtained after 700/spl deg/C heat treatment in either N/sub 2/ Or forming gas. At low temperatures, silicon cantilevers exhibit a minimum in Q at approximately 135 K, possibly due to a surface-related relaxation process.

Such techniques are very effective in reducing the burstiness of the bandwidth requirements for transmitting compressed, stored video. This paper addresses online bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of streaming video applications such as newscasts, sportscasts, and distance learning, where many clients may be willing to tolerate a playback delay of a few seconds in exchange for a smaller bandwidth requirement. The smoothing can be performed at either the source of the videocast or at special smoothing server(s) (e.g., proxies or gateways) within the network. In contrast to previous work on stored video, the online smoothing server has limited knowledge of frame sizes and access to only a segment of the video at a time. This is either because the feed is live or because it is streaming past the server. We formulate an online smoothing model which incorporates playback delay, client and server buffer sizes, server processing capacity, and frame size prediction techniques. Our model can accommodate an arbitrary arrival process. Using techniques for smoothing stored video at the source as a starting point, we develop an online, window-based smoothing algorithm for delay tolerant applications. Extensive experiments with MPEG-1 and M-JPEG video traces demonstrate that online smoothing significantly reduces the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams. These reductions can be achieved with modest playback delays of a few seconds to a few tens of seconds and moderate client buffer sizes, and closely approximate the performance of optimal offline smoothing of stored video. In addition, we show that frame size prediction can offer further reduction in resource requirements, though prediction becomes relatively less important for longer playback delays. However, the ability to predict future frame sizes affects the appropriate division of buffer space between the server and client sites. Our experiments show that the optimal buffer allocation shifts to placing more memory at the server as the server has progressively less information about future frame sizes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/17878/00825793.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/6046.825793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6046.825793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online smoothing of variable-bit-rate streaming video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Streaming media","Bandwidth","Delay","Video compression","Buffer storage","Network servers","Displays","Computer aided instruction","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video servers","smoothing methods","video signal processing","variable rate codes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-bit-rate streaming video","smoothing techniques","stored video","end to end workahead transmission","client playback buffer","online smoothing server"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Online smoothing of variable-bit-rate streaming video","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6524965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online smoothing of variable-bit-rate streaming video","sourcePdf":"00825793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057723S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"70","articleId":"825793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":825794,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is /spl Theta/(W/spl radic/An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers.

While the information hider embeds a secret message (watermark) in a covertext message (typically: text, image, sound, or video stream) within a certain distortion level, the attacker processes the resulting watermarked message, within limited additional distortion, in attempt to invalidate the watermark. For the case where the covertext source is memoryless (or, more generally where there exists some transformation that makes it memoryless), we provide a single-letter characterization of the maximin game of the random coding error exponent associated with the average probability of erroneously decoding the watermark. This single-letter characterization is in effect because if the information hider utilizes a memoryless channel to generate random codewords for every covertext message, the (causal) attacker will maximize the damage by implementing a memoryless channel as well. Partial results for the dual minimax game and the conditions for the existence of a saddle point are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6548312","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On random coding error exponents of watermarking systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On random coding error exponents of watermarking systems","sourcePdf":"00825801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036771S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","articleId":"825801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825803,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Xie","affiliation":["GE Capital, Stamford, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Qun Xie","id":"37345332700"},{"name":"A.R.

This relation typically exhibits significant nonlinearities and hysteresis because of inherent properties of magnetostrictive materials. The characterization considered here is based on the Jiles-Atherton mean field model for ferromagnetic hysteresis in combination with a quadratic moment rotation model for magnetostriction. As demonstrated by comparison with experimental data, the magnetization model very adequately quantifies both major and minor loops under various operating conditions. The combined model can then be used to accurately characterize output strains at moderate drive levels. The advantages of this model lie in the small number (six) of required parameters and its flexibility under a variety of operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6532770","volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-based hysteresis model for magnetostrictive transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-based hysteresis model for magnetostrictive transducers","sourcePdf":"00825804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036184S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"144","articleId":"825804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":825811,"authors":[{"name":"Cunsheng Ding","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

The lack of more general designs is in part due to the fact that the diversity advantage of a code is the minimum rank among the complex baseband differences between modulated codewords, which is difficult to relate to traditional code designs over finite fields and rings. We present general binary design criteria for PSK-modulated space-time codes. For linear BPSK/QPSK codes, the rank of (binary projections of) the unmodulated codewords, as binary matrices over the binary field, is a sufficient design criterion: full binary rank guarantees full spatial diversity. This criterion accounts for much of what is currently known about PSK-modulated space-time codes. We develop new fundamental code constructions for both quasi-static and time-varying channels. These are perhaps the first general constructions-other than delay diversity schemes-that guarantee full spatial diversity for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas.","doi":"10.1109/18.825816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.825816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17872/00825816.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the theory of space-time codes for PSK modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"On the theory of space-time codes for PSK modulation","volume":"46","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6548321","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of space-time codes for PSK modulation","sourcePdf":"00825816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024615S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"277","articleId":"825816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":825817,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hao Xu","id":"37439335700"},{"name":"S.M.

Unitary space-time modulation uses constellations of T/spl times/M space-time signals (/spl Phi//sub i/, l=1, ..., L), where T represents the coherence interval during which the fading is approximately constant, and M<T is the number of transmitter antennas. The columns of each /spl Phi//sub i/ are orthonormal. When the receiver does not know the propagation coefficients, which between pairs of transmitter and receiver antennas are modeled as statistically independent, this modulation performs very well either when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high or when T/spl Gt/M.

Despite the highly nonlinear nature of this problem, it has been possible to show that f(t) may always be chosen minimum-phase. A full analysis concludes with the construction of an effective numerical procedure for the determination of optimal pairs (f,h) that appears to converge satisfactorily for most values of input SINR. Extensive simulation reveals that the shape of f(t) can be a critical factor. In particular, the performance of a chirp-like pulse is often unacceptable, especially when clutter and channel noise are low-pass dominant and comparable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17872/00825822.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.825822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.825822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal transmit-receiver design in the presence of signal-dependent interference and channel noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","noise","signal detection","clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmit-receiver design","signal-dependent interference","channel noise","optimal detection","additive channel noise","transmit pulse design","receiver impulse response","signal to interference plus noise ratio","output SINR","input SINR","simulation","performance","chirp-like pulse","clutter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transmit-receiver design in the presence of signal-dependent interference and channel noise","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6548324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transmit-receiver design in the presence of signal-dependent interference and channel noise","sourcePdf":"00825822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051114S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"210","articleId":"825822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825828,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

The codewords are corrupted by small levels of roundoff noise and possibly occasionally by a few large excursions of random disturbances. The error-correcting procedure is separated into two parts, large activity detection followed by error value estimation, particularly the larger errors. The first part determines if large excursions are present, roughly identifying their locations, while the second part is a Wiener minimum mean-squared error estimation technique providing a stochastic correction to the corrupted components. The activity-detecting part determines locations for large increases in the Wiener estimator's gain. A computationally intensive Bayes hypothesis testing approach is shown to be very effective at locating large activity positions, but a more efficient modified Berlekamp-Massey (1969) algorithm is developed which leads to excellent mean-squared error performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate individual codeword corrective actions and compare the average mean-squared error performance between coded and unprotected data. The error level improvement ranges from three to four orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/18.825828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.825828","endPage":"623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17872/00825828.pdf","startPage":"609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding real block codes: activity detection Wiener estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825828/","displayDocTitle":"Decoding real block codes: activity detection Wiener estimation","volume":"46","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6548327","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding real block codes: activity detection Wiener estimation","sourcePdf":"00825828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039078S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","articleId":"825828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825831,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

Among the well-known anomalies are partial erasure and transition jitter. In this paper, we first describe a precompensation technique to combat the partial erasure effect. It utilizes the unique property of the maximum transition run (MTR) code wherein all dibits are isolated. The idea is to increase the spacing between the two transitions that make up each dibit. This tends to mitigate the nonlinear amplitude reduction associated with partial erasure. Next, we consider a recording channel that is linear but subject to transition jitter. We modify the hyperplane-based detector known as 3D-110 by introducing data-dependent threshold terms. The overall complexity of the detector is small, yet this modification provides almost 2 dB of improvement relative to the original 3D-110 structure and the extended partial response maximum likelihood (EPRML) method tuned to additive Gaussian noise.","doi":"10.1109/20.825835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17879/00825835.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.825835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"532","endPage":"536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combatting partial erasure and transition jitter in magnetic recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Combatting partial erasure and transition jitter in magnetic recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825835/","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6532782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combatting partial erasure and transition jitter in magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00825835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037609S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","articleId":"825835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825838,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

(see ibid. vol.42, p.1737-44, 1996) introduced priority encoding transmission (PET) for sending hierarchically organized messages over lossy packet-based computer networks. In a PET system, each symbol in the message is assigned a priority which determines the minimal number of codeword symbols that is required to recover that symbol. This article revisits the PET approach using tools from network information theory. We first show that priority encoding transmission is intimately related with the broadcast erasure channel with a degraded message set. Using the information spectrum approach, we provide an informational characterization of the capacity region of general broadcast channels with degraded message set. We show that the PET inequality has an information-theoretical counterpart. The inequality defining the capacity region of the broadcast erasure channel with degraded message sets. Hence the PET approach which consists in time-sharing and interleaving classical erasure-resilient codes achieves the capacity region of this channel. Moreover, we show that the PET approach may achieve the sphere packing exponents. Finally, we observe that on some simple nonstationary broadcast channels, time-sharing may be outperformed. The impact of memory on the optimality of the PET approach remains elusive.","doi":"10.1109/18.825846","startPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17872/00825846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.825846","endPage":"705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"About priority encoding transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"About priority encoding transmission","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6548342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"About priority encoding transmission","sourcePdf":"00825846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042214S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","articleId":"825846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":825847,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The schemes allow the dimensions of blocks to adapt to local activity within the image, and the total number of blocks in any frame can be varied while still accurately representing true motion. This permits adaptive bit allocation between the representation of displacement and residual data, and also the variation of the overall bit-rate on a frame-by-frame basis. The first algorithm computes the optimal selection of variable-sized blocks to provide the best-achievable prediction error under the fixed number of blocks for a quadtree-based VSBM technique. The algorithm employs an efficient dynamic programming technique utilizing the special structure of a quadtree. Although this algorithm is computationally intensive, it does provide a yardstick by which the performance of other more practical VSBM techniques can be measured. The second algorithm adopts a heuristic way to select variable-sized square blocks. It relies more on local motion information than on global error optimization. Experiments suggest that the effective use of local information contributes to minimizing the overall error. The result is a more computationally efficient VSBM technique than the optimal algorithm, but with a comparable prediction error.","doi":"10.1109/76.825857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17876/00825857.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.825857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadtree-structured variable-size block-matching motion estimation with minimal error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825857/","displayDocTitle":"Quadtree-structured variable-size block-matching motion estimation with minimal error","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6534395","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadtree-structured variable-size block-matching motion estimation with minimal error","sourcePdf":"00825857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042326S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"49","articleId":"825857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":825865,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Basically, an m-D DCT computation can be constructed from exactly one stage of smaller DCT computations of the same dimension. This is useful for both hardware and software solutions, in which a very efficient smaller size m-D DCT core has been developed, and a larger DCT computation is required.

Such tasks arise, for example, in the management of digital video libraries for content-based retrieval and browsing. We develop tools based on camera motion for analyzing and annotating a class of structured video using the low-level information available directly from MPEG-compressed video. In particular, we show that in certain structured settings, it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of camera motion by directly processing data easily obtained from the MPEG format. Working directly with the compressed video greatly reduces the processing time and enhances storage efficiency. As an illustration of this idea, we have developed a simple basketball annotation system which combines the low-level information extracted from an MPEG stream with the prior knowledge of basketball structure to provide high-level content analysis, annotation, and browsing for events such as wide-angle and close-up views, fast breaks, probable shots at the basket, etc. The methods used in this example should also be useful in the analysis of high-level content of structured video in other domains.","doi":"10.1109/76.825867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17876/00825867.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.825867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid estimation of camera motion from compressed video with application to video annotation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825867/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid estimation of camera motion from compressed video with application to video annotation","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6534405","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid estimation of camera motion from compressed video with application to video annotation","sourcePdf":"00825867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048715S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"122","articleId":"825867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":825868,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Tao","affiliation":["Sony U.

The known technique estimates 3-D motion using previously evaluated 3-D correspondence. However, in image sequence coding applications, 3-D correspondence is unknown and usually only two-dimensional (2-D) motion vectors are initially available. The novel neural network (NN) introduced in this paper uses initially estimated 2-D motion vectors to estimate 3-D rigid motion, and is therefore suitable for image sequence coding applications. Moreover, it is shown that the NN introduced in this paper performs extremely well even in cases where 3-D correspondence is known with accuracy. Experimental results are presented for the evaluation of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/76.825869","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17876/00825869.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.825869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rigid 3-D motion estimation using neural networks and initially estimated 2-D motion data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Neural networks","Image sequences","Image coding","Cameras","Information processing","Laboratories","Discrete cosine transforms","Layout","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","image coding","motion estimation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rigid three-dimensional motion estimation","3D motion estimation","neural networks","initially estimated 2D motion data","image sequence coding","2D motion vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Rigid 3-D motion estimation using neural networks and initially estimated 2-D motion data","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6534407","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rigid 3-D motion estimation using neural networks and initially estimated 2-D motion data","sourcePdf":"00825869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028895S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"9","articleId":"825869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":825872,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The quantum efficiency is formulated in a closed analytical form that includes the structural parameters of the photodetector and takes into account the wavelength dependence of the reflectivities and the active region absorption coefficient. The variation of the QWS reflectivity and, in particular, its phase constant with wavelength has a significant influence on the resulting quantum efficiency spectra, as demonstrated in this paper. The results are in very good agreement with recently published experimental data which show a dominant peak at the operating wavelength. This behavior has not been predicted by previous simulation results. Since the quantum efficiency spectra are not periodic, the use of the finesse, defined as the ratio of the free spectral range to the full width at half maximum, as a measure of wavelength selectivity is not valid. The conventional quality factor definition used for filter design is thus adopted as a measure of selectivity. A genetic algorithm-based optimization and design procedure for RCE photodetectors have also been developed with the quantum efficiency, quality factor, and frequency bandwidth as input design parameters.","doi":"10.1109/3.825879","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/17873/00825879.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.825879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of resonant-cavity-enhanced photodetectors using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Design of resonant-cavity-enhanced photodetectors using genetic algorithms","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6540430","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of resonant-cavity-enhanced photodetectors using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00825879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06825S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"11","articleId":"825879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":825881,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

Equations have been presented to describe the noise effect through the calculation of the relative intensity noise as well as the carrier-to-noise ratio available at the receiving end. Illustrative examples are given, showing the impact of the master and slave laser bias currents. Also, the injection-locked and free-running operation regimes have been comparatively analyzed. The results show how the noise characteristics are affected by optical injection and, consequently, how the operating conditions must be chosen to reduce this effect. In particular, it is shown, in agreement with previous works, that the master laser emission noise will essentially take the lead. As a result, to improve the noise behavior by injection locking a solitary laser, the use of a low-noise master laser is required. To make it easy to apply the present results to any laser diode under the stable-locking condition, the necessary relations are explicitly given before specifying the parameters of simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise characteristics of single-mode semiconductor lasers under external light injection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.825887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/17873/00825887.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.825887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=825887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/825887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Noise characteristics of single-mode semiconductor lasers under external light injection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6540436","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise characteristics of single-mode semiconductor lasers under external light injection","sourcePdf":"00825887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061693S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"46","articleId":"825887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":825891,"authors":[{"name":"A.

ECG data segments with ST-T intervals are extracted and, through principal component analysis, reduced to six components that represent 98.1% of total data variance. Data from 45 patients of the European ST-T Database were organized into three groups to develop, validate and test feedforward ANN. With six inputs, 10 neurons in the hidden layer and three in the output the ANN showed 69.6% total accuracy when classifying isolated segments. Fixed thresholds were applied to the output neutrons for detecting sequences of abnormal ST segments. The performance, 85.83% sensitivity for negative and 78.38% for positive, are similar to others reported in literature.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1999.825904","startPage":"53","endPage":"56","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1999.

The purpose of this paper is to review major milestones that set the stage for the development of today's AC drives, including sufficient details to acquaint readers with their basic principles, strengths, and limitations. Attention is devoted to the continuum of this development history and the many direct echoes of developments from the first half of the 1900s that we take for granted in today's AC drives. In addition, the spirited competition between electromechanical and electronic AC drive solutions that dominated engineering attention during the early part of the century are reviewed, highlighting the complicated interrelationship between electric machines and drive electronics that persists today.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2000.826077","publicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

This technique works by combining reduced amplitude of the reverse recovery current and a lower voltage across the rectifier during the turn off commutation. Another major advantage of the proposed circuit is the fact that the current reflected in the primary is shaped to a triangular form with a low dl/dt during the turn on of the main switch. This will allow the completion of the resonant transition to zero voltage across the primary switches. In the secondary section the reverse recovery current is reduced due to low, dI/dt current slope at turn off and the reverse voltage is clamped to the output voltage. The maximum reverse recovery voltage does not exceed the output voltage. The soft commutation in the primary section and the secondary allows a higher frequency of operation without penalty in efficiency. A 3 kW converter for on board battery charger in electric vehicles provides an output voltage between 170 V to 380 V. Efficiency above 96% is obtained at a switching frequency of 250 kHz while the power density of the converter exceeds 100 W/inc/sup 3/.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.2000.826088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17861","startPage":"86","endPage":"92 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

This paper proposes a new switching strategy which compares the torque error from a PI controller with two triangular waveforms (180/spl deg/ phase shift) hence resulting in a constant torque switching frequency. Two triangular waveforms are necessary to ensure four-quadrant operation of the DTC drive. The switching frequency of the DTC drive is determined by the frequency of the triangular waveforms and is almost independent from the speed. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate this proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2000.826099","publicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

This makes it possible to implement peak current limiting and other protection functions, which is important for large-signal stability analysis of distributed power systems, but has not been possible with existing averaged models.

Because of the closed-loop operation, full compensation of the desired harmonics is achieved even in the presence of a significant delay in the VSI current control. Because of the selective approach, active filter interactions with a possible dynamic component of the load are minimized. The complexity of the synchronous frame controllers are avoided using equivalent stationary frame controllers with the same dynamic performance.

An analytical solution for harmonic elimination under unbalanced input voltages is obtained resulting in a smooth (constant) power flow from AC to DC side in spite of the unbalanced voltage condition. Based on the analysis of the open loop configuration, a closed loop control solution is proposed. Simulation results show excellent response and stable operation of the new rectifier control algorithm. A laboratory prototype has been designed to verify the discussions and analyses done in this paper. Theoretical and experimental results show excellent agreement. Elimination of the possibility of low order AC and DC side harmonics due to unbalance is expected to materially affect the cost of DC link capacitor and AC side filter. The proposed method will be particularly useful in applications where the large second harmonic at the DC link may have a severe impact on system stability of multiply connected converters on a common link.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.2000.826136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17861","startPage":"413","endPage":"419 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

Most of reported single-stage PFC rectifiers cascade a boost type converter with a forward or a flyback DC-DC converter so that input current shaping, isolation, and fast output voltage regulation are performed in one single stage. The cost and performance of a single-stage PFC converters depend greatly on how its input current shaper (ICS) and the DC-DC converter are integrated together. For the cascade connected single-stage PFC rectifiers, the energy storage capacitor is found in either series or parallel path of energy flow. The second group appears to represent the main stream. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on this group. It is found that many of these topologies can be implemented by combining a 2-terminal or 3-terminal boost ICS cell with DC-DC converter along with an energy storage capacitor in between. A general rule is observed that translates a 3-terminal ICS cell to a 2-terminal ICS cell using an additional winding from the transformer and vice versa. According to the translation rule, many of reported single-stage PFC topologies can be viewed as electrically equivalent to one another. Several new PFC converters were derived from some existing topologies using the translation rule.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2000.826144","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC 2000.

Insulation aging seems to be correlated to the partial discharge (PD) activity of surges with very fast risetimes and high magnitudes. The magnitude and the risetime of the surges for a particular motor are determined by a host of factors, including power cable length, cable insulation, grounding, IFD type, and motor surge impedance, Hence, the nature of the surges can not be estimated without direct measurement. This paper describes a portable instrument which can accurately measure the characteristics of a surge, even those with a risetime as fast as 50 ns. Measurements with this instrument can be carried out both economically and with minimal training. Also discussed is a new device which permits the easy measurement of PD during 100 ns risetime surges. The latter can be used to determine the discharge inception voltage of stators under actual steep fronted surge conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6544827","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"28-28 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"New tools to determine the vulnerability of stator windings to voltage surges from IFDs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New tools to determine the vulnerability of stator windings to voltage surges from IFDs","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00826197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037149S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6670","citationCount":"20","articleId":"826197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":826310,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The targets are moving along a highway, with varying obscuration due to changing terrain conditions. In addition, the roads can branch, merge or cross-the scenario represents target convoys along a realistic road network with junctions, changing terrains, etc. Some of the targets may also move in an open field. This constrained motion estimation problem is handled using an IMM estimator with varying mode sets depending on the topography, The number of models in the IMM estimator, their types and their parameters are modified adaptively, in real-time, based on the estimated position of the target and the corresponding road/visibility conditions. This topography-based variable structure mechanism eliminates the need for carrying all the possible models throughout the entire tracking period as in the standard IMM estimator, significantly improving performance and reducing computational load. Data association is handled using an assignment algorithm. The estimator is designed to handle a very large number of ground targets simultaneously. A simulated scenario consisting of over one hundred targets is used to illustrate the selection of design parameters and the operation of the tracker. Performance measures are presented to contrast the benefits of the VS-IMM estimator over the Kalman filter and the standard IMM estimator, The VS-IMM estimator is then combined with multidimensional assignment to gain \"time-depth.\" The additional benefit of using higher dimensional assignment algorithms for data association is also evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6540393","displayDocTitle":"Ground target tracking with variable structure IMM estimator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground target tracking with variable structure IMM estimator","sourcePdf":"00826310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039329S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"207","articleId":"826310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":826314,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A set of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) controlled by a microcontroller is used to route equalization current to the lowest voltage batteries. Since only the lowest voltage batteries are connected to the equalizer, the need for uniform transformer leakage inductance is avoided, and a lower power level can be used since no excess current flows to the other batteries. An equalization experiment has shown that a 37 W selective equalizer had a slightly better effect on a 24-battery pack than a 63 W ramp equalizer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/17885/00826322.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.826322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.826322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective buck-boost equalizer for series battery packs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Batteries","Hybrid electric vehicles","Low voltage","Electrodes","Circuit testing","Voltage control","Microcontrollers","Inductance","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","battery chargers","secondary cells","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective buck-boost equalizer","series battery packs","bipolar junction transistors","microcontroller controlled","equalization current","lowest voltage batteries","useful energy","isolated DC-DC converter","selective switch module","switch controller","37 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Selective buck-boost equalizer for series battery packs","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6532757","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective buck-boost equalizer for series battery packs","sourcePdf":"00826322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034445S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"130","articleId":"826322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826335,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The efficient numerical solution of FPKE presented relies on the key issue of adaptively calculating the domain over which the state probability density function is to be evaluated, which is done using Chebyshev's inequality. Application to a passive tracking example shows that this approach can provide consistent estimators when measurement nonlinearities and noise levels are high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6540404","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear filter design using Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov probability density evolutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear filter design using Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov probability density evolutions","sourcePdf":"00826335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037847S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"69","articleId":"826335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":826340,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Guan","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Jian Guan","id":"37087070501"},{"name":"Ying-Ning Peng","lastName":"Ying-Ning Peng","id":"37087193659"},{"name":"You He","lastName":"You He","id":"37087182754"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"826340","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Global Positioning System","Clutter","Detectors","Least squares methods","Monitoring","Radio navigation","Radar detection","Meetings","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar detection","adaptive signal detection","exponential distribution","Weibull distribution","invariance","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant false-alarm rate","adaptive detectors","clutter power level","reference cell samples","invariant test","weak conditions","radar signal detection","invariant transformations","hypothesis testing","scale transformation","Rayleigh distribution","Weibull distribution","exponential distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826340","abstract":"Many adaptive detectors regulate the detection threshold adaptively through an estimate of the clutter power level, which is formed by reference cell samples.

However, the state of the art for managing IP networks involves manual configuration of each IP router, and traffic engineering based on limited measurements. The networking industry is sorely lacking in software systems that a large Internet service provider can use to support traffic measurement and network modeling, the underpinnings of effective traffic engineering. This article describes the AT&T Labs NetScope, a unified set of software tools for managing the performance of IP backbone networks. The key idea behind NetScope is to generate global views of the network on the basis of configuration and usage data associated with the individual network elements. Having created an appropriate global view, we are able to infer and visualize the networkwide implications of local changes in traffic, configuration, and control. Using NetScope, a network provider can experiment with changes in network configuration in a simulated environment rather than the operational network. In addition, the tool provides a sound framework for additional modules for network optimization and performance debugging. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tool through an example traffic engineering exercise of locating a heavily loaded link, identifying which traffic demands flow on the link, and changing the configuration of intradomain routing to reduce the congestion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/17887/00826367.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/65.826367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.826367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NetScope: traffic engineering for IP networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","IP networks","Traffic control","Routing","Communication system traffic control","Engineering management","Computer industry","Software systems","Web and internet services","Software measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication computing","telecommunication congestion control","transport protocols","software tools","Internet","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic engineering","IP network management","traffic flows","routing policies","network configuration","IP router","routing protocols","networking industry","software systems","Internet service provider","traffic measurement","network modeling","NetScope","AT&T Labs","software tools","IP backbone networks","configuration data","usage data","network elements","network provider","simulated environment","network optimization","performance debugging","heavily loaded link","intradomain routing","congestion reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"NetScope: traffic engineering for IP networks","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2000","accessionNumber":"6549096","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NetScope: traffic engineering for IP networks","sourcePdf":"00826367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031224S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isNumber":"17887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"119","articleId":"826367","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826368,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

The ANNs are able to produce a diagnosis, even in difficult situations, such as the presence of noisy data or protection system failures. Tests are performed using a test system and a real Brazilian power system to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 1999-Sept. 2 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826561/","accessionNumber":"6504075","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis in electrical power systems using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis in electrical power systems using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"00826561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038066S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 1999-Sept. 2 1999","isNumber":"17680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6626","citationCount":"4","articleId":"826561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":826565,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

This is achieved by introducing a current source or a resistor between the opamp negative input terminal and one of the supply rails. Hence, in this technique, opamps with limited input common-mode range can be used. In addition, switches can be incorporated in these circuits to allow a wide range of applications. This technique also allows large input and output signal swings (close to rail-to-rail), even at a very low-voltage supply. To demonstrate the proposed technique, four track-and-hold amplifiers (THA's) and a 10 bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) have been designed in a conventional 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process and tested at a 1 V supply. The DAC consumes less than 0.45 mW and has a maximum throughput of 1 MS/s, with close to rail-to-rail output (0.1-0.9 V). The maximum differential nonlinearity error and integral nonlinearity error were measured to be 1.7 least significant bits (LSB's) and 3.0 LSB's, respectively. Each THA dissipates less than 0.35 mW and achieves a hold mode total harmonic distortion of less than -61 dB for a 100 kHz, 1.4 V/sub p-p/ differential input signal, sampled at a rate of 1 MS/s.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17931/00826743.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.826743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.826743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-voltage analog circuit design based on biased inverting opamp configuration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Rail to rail outputs","Voltage","Resistors","Switching circuits","Switches","Rail to rail inputs","Digital-analog conversion","CMOS process","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","low-power electronics","integrated circuit design","sample and hold circuits","digital-analogue conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LV analog circuit design","low-voltage operation","biased inverting opamp configuration","input common-mode voltage","current source","switches","track/hold amplifiers","digital/analog converter","CMOS process","DAC","D/A convertor","1.2 micron","10 bit","1 V","0.45 mW","0.35 mW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Low-voltage analog circuit design based on biased inverting opamp configuration","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556797","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-voltage analog circuit design based on biased inverting opamp configuration","sourcePdf":"00826743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082002S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"54","articleId":"826743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":826744,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Smaller numbers have faster operations. That is exactly the reason why residue number systems are attractive in computer arithmetic. However, the conversion from residue to binary numbers involves a large number module operations. Several residue-to-binary converters are proposed in this paper. The converters are based on the New Chinese Remainder Theorems (CRT's) I and II which represent our work. The New CRT's improve the celebrated CRT. The new algorithms do not use any large size module adders. The numbers involved are much smaller compared to the numbers in the CRT and its alternative, the Mixed Radix Conversion method. Given a moduli set as (P/sub 1/, P/sub 2/,, P/sub n/), to convert a residue number (x/sub 1/,x/sub 2/,...,x/sub n/) to its decimal correspondence, a matrix of numbers bounded by P/sub i/ is needed for the New CRT I compared to the large numbers M/P/sub i/ for the CRT, where M=P/sub 1/P/sub 2/...P/sub n/. The New CRT II uses module multipliers of size less than /spl radic/M. If the condition P/sub i+1/>P/sub 1/+P/sub 2/+...+P/sub i/ is satisfied, only one module operation of size P/sub n/ is needed for the conversion. Residue-to-binary conversion based on the New CRT's presented here will have a significant impact on many algorithms which currently use the CRT, particularly in computer arithmetic such as residue number systems.","doi":"10.1109/82.826745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17931/00826745.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.826745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residue-to-binary converters based on new Chinese remainder theorems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826745/","displayDocTitle":"Residue-to-binary converters based on new Chinese remainder theorems","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6556799","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residue-to-binary converters based on new Chinese remainder theorems","sourcePdf":"00826745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059699S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"102","articleId":"826745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826746,"authors":[{"name":"J.

One interesting class of these filters is the polynomial-based interpolation filters which can be efficiently implemented using the Farrow structure. This discrete-time filter structure has a time-varying impulse response. Therefore, it is usually modeled by a simple hybrid analog/digital (A/D) system which is based on the reconstruction of the continuous-time signal. In this work, an interesting frequency-domain relationship between the Farrow structure and the hybrid A/D model is derived. This result can be utilized to develop efficient design algorithms for polynomial-based interpolation filters.","doi":"10.1109/82.826746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.826746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17931","startPage":"206","endPage":"209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17931/00826746.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826746","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Interpolation","Finite impulse response filter","Digital signal processing","Digital filters","Frequency domain analysis","Equations","Sampling methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomials","interpolation","filtering theory","frequency-domain analysis","frequency-domain synthesis","discrete time filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain approach","polynomial-based interpolation filters","Farrow structure","hybrid analog/digital system","discrete-time filter structure","time-varying impulse response","hybrid A/D model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A frequency-domain approach to polynomial-based interpolation and the Farrow structure","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556800","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826746/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency-domain approach to polynomial-based interpolation and the Farrow structure","sourcePdf":"00826746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025278S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"27","articleId":"826746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":826747,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulation results confirm the observation and a case of 14 bit INL realized by 7 bit capacitor matching is shown. The relaxed matching requirement enables the scale-down of the capacitor sizes to that of the KT/C limit.

For reasons of storage space, images in a collection, such as satellite pictures in geographic information systems, are maintained in compressed form. Instead of performing a spatially selective operation on an image by first decompressing the compressed version, we propose to perform queries directly on the compressed version of the image. We suggest a compression technique that allows for the subsequent use of a spatial index structure to guide a spatial search. In response to a window query, our algorithm delivers a compressed partial image, or the exact uncompressed requested image region.

While wavelet or subband coding of images has been shown to be superior to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented in low memory without significant loss in performance. We present a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our approach is \"line-based\" in that the images are read line by line and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory. There are two main contributions of our work. First, we introduce a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform, which yields the same results as a \"normal\" implementation, but where, unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local set of wavelet coefficients. This low memory coder achieves performance comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556763","pubMedId":"18255410","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Line-based, reduced memory, wavelet image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line-based, reduced memory, wavelet image compression","sourcePdf":"00826776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034759S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"227","articleId":"826776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":826777,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M.

Due to their noncausal nature, these models generally lead to iterative inference algorithms that are computationally demanding. In this paper, we consider a special class of nonlinear Markov models which allow one to circumvent this drawback. These models are defined as discrete Markov random fields (MRF) attached to the nodes of a quadtree. The quadtree induces causality properties which enable the design of exact, noniterative inference algorithms, similar to those used in the context of Markov chain models. We first introduce an extension of the Viterbi algorithm which enables exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation on the quadtree. Two other algorithms, related to the MPM criterion and to Bouman and Shapiro's (1994) sequential-MAP (SMAP) estimator are derived on the same hierarchical structure. The estimation of the model hyper parameters is also addressed. Two expectation-maximization (EM)-type algorithms, allowing unsupervised inference with these models are defined. The practical relevance of the different models and inference algorithms is investigated in the context of image classification problem, on both synthetic and natural images.","doi":"10.1109/83.826777","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"390","endPage":"404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17937/00826777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.826777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Markov image modeling and inference on the quadtree","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inference algorithms","Markov random fields","Iterative algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Context modeling","Inverse problems","Viterbi algorithm","Image classification","Bayesian methods","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image classification","Markov processes","quadtrees","inverse problems","random processes","maximum likelihood estimation","optimisation","inference mechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Markov image modeling","quadtree","noncasual Markov models","energy-based models","vision applications","image representation","high-dimensional inverse problems","iterative inference algorithms","nonlinear Markov models","discrete Markov random fields","MRF","causality properties","noniterative inference algorithms","Markov chain models","Viterbi algorithm","exact maximum a posteriori estimation","MAP estimation","sequential-MAP estimator","SMAP estimator","hierarchical structure","hyper parameters","expectation-maximization type algorithms","EM-type algorithms","unsupervised inference","inference algorithms","image classification","synthetic images","natural images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Markov image modeling and inference on the quadtree","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6556764","pubMedId":"18255411","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826777/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Markov image modeling and inference on the quadtree","sourcePdf":"00826777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058059S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"124","articleId":"826777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":826780,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper focuses on the use of hierarchical tree-structures to both speed-up search-by-query and organize databases for effective browsing. The first part of this paper develops a fast search algorithm based on best-first branch and bound search. This algorithm is designed so that speed and accuracy may be continuously traded-off through the selection of a parameter /spl lambda/. We find that the algorithm is most effective when used to perform an approximate search, where it can typically reduce computation by a factor of 20-40 for accuracies ranging from 80% to 90%. We then present a method for designing a hierarchical browsing environment which we call a similarity pyramid. The similarity pyramid groups similar images together while allowing users to view the database at varying levels of resolution. We show that the similarity pyramid is best constructed using agglomerative (bottom up) clustering methods, and present a fast sparse clustering method which dramatically reduces both memory and computation over conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/83.826781","startPage":"442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17937/00826781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.826781","endPage":"455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical browsing and search of large image databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical browsing and search of large image databases","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6556768","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","pubMedId":"18255415","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical browsing and search of large image databases","sourcePdf":"00826781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049203S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"80","articleId":"826781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":826784,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method is generic in that it can accommodate various global motion models, from a simple translation to an eight-parameter perspective model. The algorithm is hierarchical and consists of three stages. In the first stage, a low-pass image pyramid is built. Then, an initial translation is estimated with full-pixel precision at the top of the pyramid using a modified n-step search matching. In the third stage, a gradient descent is executed at each level of the pyramid starting from the initial translation at the coarsest level. Due to the coarse initial estimation and the hierarchical implementation, the method is very fast. To increase robustness to outliers, we replace the usual formulation based on a quadratic error criterion with a truncated quadratic function. We have applied the algorithm to various test sequences within an MPEG-4 coding system. From the experimental results we conclude that global motion estimation provides significant performance gains for video material with camera zoom and/or pan. The gains result from a reduced prediction error and a more compact representation of motion. We also conclude that the robust error criterion can introduce additional performance gains without increasing computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/83.826785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17937/00826785.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.826785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient, robust, and fast global motion estimation for video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826785/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient, robust, and fast global motion estimation for video coding","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556772","pubMedId":"18255419","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient, robust, and fast global motion estimation for video coding","sourcePdf":"00826785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052641S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"230","articleId":"826785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826786,"authors":[{"name":"X.Q.

Our control objective is to regulate the air-fuel ratio and the fraction of recirculated exhaust gas to their respective set points that depend on engine operating conditions. Interactions between the two actuators and nonlinear behavior of the system make the problem difficult to handle using classical control design methods. Instead, we employ a control Lyapunov function (CLF) based nonlinear control design method because it possesses a guaranteed robustness property equivalent to gain and phase margins.

First we apply extremum seeking to the Moore-Greitzer model and design a feedback scheme actuated through a bleed valve which simultaneously stabilizes rotating stall and surge and steers the system towards the equilibrium with maximal pressure. Then we implement the scheme on a compressor rig in Murray's laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. We perform stabilization of rotating stall via air injection and implement extremum seeking through a slow bleed valve. The experiment demonstrates that extremum seeking ensures the maximization of the pressure rise starting on either side of the stall inception point. The experiment also resolves a concern that extremum seeking requires the use of periodic probing-the amplitude of probing needed to achieve convergence is far below the noise level of the compressor system (even outside rotating stall).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6557112","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental application of extremum seeking on an axial-flow compressor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental application of extremum seeking on an axial-flow compressor","sourcePdf":"00826801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055551S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"104","articleId":"826801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":826811,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Part of the difficulty is that device noise undergoes multiple frequency translations to become oscillator phase noise. A quantitative understanding of this process requires abandoning the principle of time invariance assumed in most older theories of phase noise. Fortunately, the noise-to-phase transfer function of oscillators is still linear, despite the existence of the nonlinearities necessary for amplitude stabilization. In addition to providing a quantitative reconciliation between theory and measurement, the time-varying phase noise model presented in this tutorial identifies the importance of symmetry in suppressing the upconversion of 1/f noise into close-in phase noise, and provides an explicit appreciation of cyclostationary effects and AM-PM conversion. These insights allow a reinterpretation of why the Colpitts oscillator exhibits good performance, and suggest new oscillator topologies. Tuned LC and ring oscillator circuit examples are presented to reinforce the theoretical considerations developed.

The series resistance of the on-chip inductor is incorporated as part of the load resistance to permit a large inductance to be realized with minimum area and capacitance. Simple, accurate inductance expressions are used in a lumped circuit inductor model to allow the passive and active components in the circuit to be simultaneously optimized. A quick and efficient global optimization method, based on geometric programming, is discussed. The bandwidth extension technique is applied in the implementation of a 2.125-Gbaud preamplifier that employs a common-gate input stage followed by a cascoded common-source stage. On-chip shunt peaking is introduced at the dominant pole to improve the overall system performance, including a 40% increase in the transimpedance. This implementation achieves a 1.6-k/spl Omega/ transimpedance and a 0.6-/spl mu/A input-referred current noise, while operating with a photodiode capacitance of 0.6 pF. A fully differential topology ensures good substrate and supply noise immunity. The amplifier, implemented in a triple-metal, single-poly, 14-GHz f/sub Tmax/, 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process, dissipates 225 mW, of which 110 mW is consumed by the 50-/spl Omega/ output driver stage.

The measured sensitivity of clock period jitter to supply voltage is 2.6 ps/100 mv over an analog supply-voltage range of 1.6-2.1 V; the measured output operating frequency range is 8.5-660 MHz. Fabricated in an area of 310/spl times/280 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ in a 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS process, the PLL dissipates 25 mW from a 1.9-V supply.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.826829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17940/00826829.pdf","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-jitter 1.9-V CMOS PLL for UltraSPARC microprocessor applications","doi":"10.1109/4.826829","startPage":"450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"A low-jitter 1.9-V CMOS PLL for UltraSPARC microprocessor applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826829/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6562419","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-jitter 1.9-V CMOS PLL for UltraSPARC microprocessor applications","sourcePdf":"00826829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034508S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"47","articleId":"826829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":826832,"authors":[{"name":"Chieh-Tsao Hwan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

The method is featured by hybridizing the flexible prism-based finite-element method to handle the region near the curved metallization boundary and the efficient rectangular-gridded FDTD method for most of the regular region. It can be used to deal with shielded or unshielded planar components such as patch antennas, filters, resonators, couplers, dividers, vias, and various transitions between planar transmission lines. Although only representative structures, e.g., grounded via, through hole via, and coplanar waveguide to coplanar stripline transition, are analyzed in this paper, the underlined formulation is applicable to layered structures with arbitrary curved boundary in the transverse direction. The accuracy of this method is verified by comparing the calculated results with those by other methods. Also, by the analysis of computational complexity, the present method is shown to be as efficient as the conventional FDTD method, with negligible overhead in memory and computation time for handling the curved boundary.","doi":"10.1109/22.826832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17938/00826832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.826832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially prism-gridded FDTD analysis for layered structures of transversely curved boundary","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Microwave theory and techniques","Millimeter wave circuits","Millimeter wave technology","Microwave circuits","Finite element methods","Metallization","Patch antennas","Resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","microwave circuits","millimetre wave circuits","computational complexity","finite element analysis","strip line components","coplanar waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially prism-gridded FDTD analysis","layered structures","transversely curved boundary","finite-difference time-domain method","microwave planar circuits","MM-wave planar circuits","shielded planar components","unshielded planar components","patch antennas","filters","resonators","couplers","dividers","vias","transitions","computational complexity","prism-based finite-element method","prism-based FEM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Partially prism-gridded FDTD analysis for layered structures of transversely curved boundary","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6554536","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826832/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially prism-gridded FDTD analysis for layered structures of transversely curved boundary","sourcePdf":"00826832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085309S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"2","articleId":"826832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826834,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The mechatronic arthroscope has a cable-actuated servomotor-driven multi-joint mechanical structure, is equipped with a position sensor for measuring the orientation of the tip and a force sensor for detecting possible contact with delicate tissues in the knee, and incorporates an embedded microcontroller for sensor signal processing, motor driving and interfacing with the surgeon and/or the system control unit. The computer-assisted arthroscopy system comprises an image processing module for the segmentation and 3D reconstruction of pre-operative CT or MR images, a registration module for measuring the position of the knee joint, tracking the trajectory of the operating tools and matching pre-operative and intra-operative images, and a human-machine interface that displays the enhanced reality scenario and data from the mechatronic arthroscope in a friendly and intuitive manner. By integrating pre-operative and intra-operative images and information provided by the mechatronic arthroscope, the system allows virtual navigation in the knee joint during the planning phase and computer guidance by augmented reality during the intervention.

The pdf of the input vectors of an unknown normal or pathological speaker is also modeled by such a prototype distribution neural map (PDM(X)), and the pathology detection is done by means of a ratio of specific similarities rather than by a direct comparison of some type of distance/similarity with a threshold. The experiments show an increased classification accuracy and that the proposed method can be used for screening the laryngeal diseases.

Optical polymers are versatile materials that can be readily formed into planar single-mode, multimode, and microoptical waveguide structures ranging in dimensions from under a micrometer to several hundred micrometers. These materials can be thermoplastics, thermosets, or photopolymers, and the starting formulations are typically either polymers or oligomers in solution or liquid monomers. Transmission losses in polymers can be minimized, typically by halogenation, with state-of-the-art loss values being about 0.01 dB/cm at 840 nm and about 0.1 dB/cm at 1550 nm. A number of polymers have been shown to exhibit excellent environmental stability and have demonstrated capability in a variety of demanding applications. Waveguides can be formed by direct photolithography, reactive ion etching, laser ablation, molding, or embossing. Well-developed adhesion schemes permit the use of polymers on a wide range of rigid and flexible substrates. Integrated optical devices fabricated to date include numerous passive and active elements that achieve a variety of coupling, routing, filtering, and switching functions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in polymer integrated optics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/2944.826873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/17936/00826873.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.826873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Advances in polymer integrated optics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6553257","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in polymer integrated optics","sourcePdf":"00826873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064564S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"451","articleId":"826873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":826874,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

The amplifier model is based on propagation and population-rate equations and includes both uniform and pair-induced up-conversion mechanisms. It is solved numerically by combining finite elements and the Runge-Kutta algorithm. The analysis predicts that Er/sup 3+/-doped tellurite waveguides exhibit improved gain characteristics compared with alumina and Al/P silica waveguides. Using Er/sup 3+/-doped tellurite waveguide amplifiers, it is suggested that 16 WDM channels may be transmitted to a maximum distance of 4250 km. By using in-line notch gain equalizing filters, the maximum transmission distance can be increased to 5250 km.","doi":"10.1109/2944.826879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.826879","startPage":"114","endPage":"121","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/17936/00826879.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Er/sup 3+/-doped channel optical waveguide amplifiers for WDM systems: a comparison of tellurite, alumina and Al/P silicate materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Er/sup 3+/-doped channel optical waveguide amplifiers for WDM systems: a comparison of tellurite, alumina and Al/P silicate materials","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6553263","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826879/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Er/sup 3+/-doped channel optical waveguide amplifiers for WDM systems: a comparison of tellurite, alumina and Al/P silicate materials","sourcePdf":"00826879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035198S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"44","articleId":"826879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826884,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is clearly shown that the proximity of the semiconductor-air interface cannot be neglected without compromising accuracy, especially in the practically important case of coated facets. Furthermore, the novel method described here is easy to implement, as well as being accurate and fast.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Optical waveguides","Reflectivity","Semiconductor waveguides","Semiconductor lasers","Waveguide lasers","Optical fiber devices","Optical fiber polarization","Optical amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflectivity","semiconductor lasers","waveguide lasers","optical design techniques","light polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facet design","buried lasers","laser amplifiers","facet reflectivity","semiconductor lasers","finite distance","upper semiconductor-air interface","full three-dimensional nature","air-semiconductor boundary","TM polarization","TE polarization","angled facets","coated facets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2944.826886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/17936/00826886.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.826886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in facet design for buried lasers and amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advances in facet design for buried lasers and amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826886/","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6553270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in facet design for buried lasers and amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00826886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039027S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"11","articleId":"826886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":826889,"authors":[{"name":"San-Liang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"San-Liang Lee","id":"37087186833"},{"name":"Ing-Fa Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ing-Fa Jang","id":"37087429104"},{"name":"Chi-Yu Wang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Yu Wang","id":"37087300716"},{"name":"Ching-Tang Pien","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Tang Pien","id":"37087356602"},{"name":"Tien-Tsorng Shih","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tien-Tsorng Shih","id":"37087300701"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-260X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4542"}],"articleNumber":"826889","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":250},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"For accurate control of the channel spacing in fabricating multiwavelength laser arrays or discrete multicolor lasers, we proposed a novel approach that exploits sampled grating distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors to vary the laser wave length across the wafer. This approach can realize a set of lasers with a wavelength spacing that meets the ITU recommendations for dense wavelength-division multiplexing systems and a wavelength range that can cover up to 40 nm or more. The wavelength variation across an array is achieved by changing the sampling periods of the DBR mirrors from laser to laser. The accuracy on the channel spacing of sampled grating DBR laser arrays was shown to be the same as that of conventional distributed feedback or DBR laser arrays, but their wavelengths can be better controlled for the gratings are fabricated with single holographic exposure. Arrays of 21 lasers have been successfully fabricated and have around 0.8-nm wavelength spacing with a simple tuning mechanism.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed Bragg reflectors","Distributed feedback devices","Optical arrays","Laser feedback","Laser tuning","Optical control","Channel spacing","Mirrors","Bragg gratings","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optoelectronics","diffraction gratings","distributed Bragg reflector lasers","semiconductor laser arrays","optical fabrication","wavelength division multiplexing","optical transmitters","laser mirrors","laser tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithically integrated multiwavelength sampled grating DBR lasers","dense WDM applications","accurate control","channel spacing","multiwavelength laser array fabrication","sampled grating distributed Bragg reflector mirrors","DBR mirrors","wavelength-division multiplexing systems","wavelength variation","single holographic exposure","tuning mechanism","wavelength spacing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2944.826889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/17936/00826889.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.826889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithically integrated multiwavelength sampled grating DBR lasers for dense WDM applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monolithically integrated multiwavelength sampled grating DBR lasers for dense WDM applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826889/","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6553273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithically integrated multiwavelength sampled grating DBR lasers for dense WDM applications","sourcePdf":"00826889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049973S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"37","articleId":"826889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":826897,"authors":[{"name":"Gyoungwon Park","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Gyoungwon Park","id":"37365378800"},{"name":"O.B.

Available bit rate (ABR) traffic is not guaranteed quality of service (QoS) in the setup connection, and it can dynamically share the available bandwidth. Therefore, congestion can be controlled by regulating the source rate, to a certain degree, according to the current traffic flow. Traditional methods perform congestion control by monitoring the queue length. The source rate is decreased by a fixed rate when the queue length is greater than a prespecified threshold. However, it is difficult to get a suitable rate according to the degree of traffic congestion. We employ a neural-fuzzy mechanism to control the source rate. Through learning, membership values can be generated and cell loss can be predicted from the status of the queue length. Then, an explicit rate is calculated and the source rate is controlled appropriately. Simulation results have shown that our method is effective compared with traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/3477.826942","startPage":"2","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.826942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17934/00826942.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-fuzzy system for congestion control in ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826942/","displayDocTitle":"A neural-fuzzy system for congestion control in ATM networks","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6553541","pubMedId":"18244724","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-fuzzy system for congestion control in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00826942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044113S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"34","articleId":"826942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":826944,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management Technology, Tamsui Oxford University College, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Ming Chen","id":"37087195905"},{"name":"Jer-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jer-Ferr Yang","id":"37087284633"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"826944","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826944","abstract":"In this paper, we propose generalized layer winner-take-all (WTA) neural networks based on the suggested full WTA networks, which can be extended from any existing WTA structure with a simple weighted-and-sum neuron.

Recently, the design of the fuzzy sets and the rule base has been automated by the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) which are powerful search techniques. Though the use of GAs can produce near optimal FLCs, it raises problems such as messy overlapping of fuzzy sets and rules not in agreement with common sense. This paper describes an enhanced genetic algorithm which constrains the optimization of FLCs to produce well-formed fuzzy sets and rules which can be better understood by human beings. To achieve the above, we devised several new genetic operators and used a parallel GA with three populations for optimizing FLCs with 3/spl times/3, 5/spl times/5, and 7/spl times/7 rule bases, and we also used a novel method for creating migrants between the three populations of the parallel GA to increase the chances of optimization. In this paper, we also present the results of applying our GA to designing FLCs for controlling three different plants and compare the performance of these FLC's with their unconstrained counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/3477.826945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17934/00826945.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.826945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraining the optimization of a fuzzy logic controller using an enhanced genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/826945/","displayDocTitle":"Constraining the optimization of a fuzzy logic controller using an enhanced genetic algorithm","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6553544","pubMedId":"18244727","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraining the optimization of a fuzzy logic controller using an enhanced genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00826945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044866S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"65","articleId":"826945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":826949,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Tsong Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hwa-Hsia College of Technology and Commerce, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Tsong Jeng","id":"37086977690"},{"name":"Tsu-Tian Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsu-Tian Lee","id":"37087160987"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"826949","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Chebyshev approximation","Polynomials","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Control systems","Feedforward neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","feedforward neural nets","Chebyshev approximation","polynomials","magnetic bearings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic bearing systems control","Chebyshev polynomial-based unified model","neural network","recurrent neural network","feedforward neural network","inverse system method","learning algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=826949","abstract":"A Chebyshev polynomial-based unified model (CPBUM) neural network is introduced and applied to control a magnetic bearing systems.

Three significant characteristics of the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to the Dirac-structure edges are presented: (1) slope invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform of a Dirac-structure edge is independent on the slope of the edge; (2) grey-level invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to a Dirac-structure edge takes place at the same points when the images with different grey-levels are processed; and (3) width light-dependent: for various widths of the Dirac-structure edge images, the location of maximum modulus of the wavelet transform varies lightly under the certain circumscription that the scale of the wavelet transform is larger than the width of the Dirac-structure edges. It is important, in practice, to select the suitable wavelet functions, according to the structures of edges. For example, Haar wavelet is better to represent brick-like images than other wavelets. A mapping technique is applied in this paper to construct such a wavelet function. In this way, a low-pass function is mapped onto a wavelet function by a derivation operation.

Selection criteria for specifying the fixed structural parameters as well as the adaptation laws for updating the adjustable parameters of the networks are provided. During identification, the two-link flexible manipulator is under nonlinear control and the input-output data sets are generated for different desired trajectories.

A Kalman filter does the tracking by recursively predicting the tentative feature location and a higher order statistics (HOS)-based data clustering algorithm extracts the feature.

A stable controller-parameter adjustment mechanism, which is determined using the Lyapunov theory, is constructed using a /spl sigma/-modification-type updating law. The evaluation of control error in terms of the neural network learning error is performed. That is, the control error converges asymptotically to a neighborhood of zero, whose size is evaluated and depends on the approximation error of the neural network.

In particular we look at filters of the sampling kind, also referred to as particle filters. In a setting where the system is nonlinear, and/or the load disturbance and measurement noise are not Gaussian, the (extended) Kalman filter may exhibit poor performance. In this case one is forced to look at alternative filtering methods. A method that works fine in many situations is the application of a so called sampling filter. The main disadvantage of these sampling types of filter is their computational load, which, especially in real time applications, is of paramount importance. The computation time consuming part of the sampling types of filter is the sampling part. The computational load of this stage of the filter algorithm is determined by two factors, namely: 1. The way in which the sampling stage is implemented. 2. The number of samples that is used. While the first issue has received broad attention in the literature the second one has not. In this report we try to fill this gap and suggest a method to relate the required number of samples in a quantitative way to the accuracy and the level of confidence by which the sampling stage is performed. This method is based on inequalities from probability theory and statistical learning theory. These inequalities then provide bounds for the sample size.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering","nonlinear filtering problem","sampling filters","computational load","filter algorithm","required number of samples","level of confidence","inequalities","probability theory","statistical learning theory","bounds for sample size","state estimation","stochastic dynamical system","noisy measurements","Bayes rule","bootstrap algorithm","Chebyshev bound","3D target tracking","discrete time model","state space form","Gaussian process"]}],"doi":"10.1049/ic:19990506","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Trget Tracking: Algorithms and Applications (Ref.

This results in a Variable Structure IMM (VS-IMM) estimator where the mode set not only differs across targets, but also varies with time for a given target. This paper addresses the problem of tracking convoys of ground targets using Moving Target Indicator (MTI) reports to illustrate the development, operation and the benefits of an adaptive VS-IMM estimator. The targets under track are moving along a constrained path, for example, a highway, with varying obscuration due to changing terrain conditions. Here we present a VS-IMM estimator, where filter modules are adaptively modified, added or removed depending on the terrain topography, for tracking on-road and off-road targets within the same framework. At each scan, the structure of the estimator for every target is individually modified based on the known topography of the surveillance region and the predicted location of the target. This enables the estimator to handle the variation in the possible motion modes across targets as well as with time for each target. Because of the nonlinear nature of the MTI reports, which consist of two-dimensional positions and range rate, extended Kalman filters are used as IMM estimator modules.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Trget Tracking: Algorithms and Applications (Ref.

In practice, this is often not the case. For example, a high resolution sensor may be able to resolve features on an extended target. An analogous problem is that of tracking a group of point targets moving in formation. In both cases, there is a strong interdependency between the individual sensor measurements. In this paper, we handle both of these cases via the same model of individual motion superposed on a common \"bulk\" effect. A common approach to tracking groups of (dependent) points is to perform the update operation in two distinct steps. The first stage is to find the \"best\" match or registration between the set of measurements and the predicted pattern, while the second step is to generate an estimate based on the assumption that the selected association is correct. The complexity of managing multiple hypotheses with strongly interdependent groups is usually avoided. However, particularly in stressing scenarios, where the measurement-object association is highly uncertain, a multiple hypothesis approach should have significant advantages. We present a Bayesian multiple hypothesis solution using the bootstrap or particle filter technique in which the probability distribution of the problem state vector is represented by a set of random samples or \"particles\". The great advantage of this approach is that the sample set implicitly includes information on previous hypotheses and so awkward hypothesis management is avoided. Only the feasible association hypotheses for the current update of the filter need to be considered for construction of the measurement likelihood function.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19990517","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Trget Tracking: Algorithms and Applications (Ref.

Nonpermissive background molecules of either polyethylene glycol (PEG) or the amino acid serine (C/sub 3/H/sub 7/NO/sub 3/) were evaluated. The foreground regions were microstamped with 3-, 5-, or 10-/spl mu/m lines of poly-D-lysine (PDL), which promotes neural attachment and growth. After 29 days in culture the foreground compliance, or the fraction of all live somata which rested on the desired PDL surface, averaged 86% for serine and 90% for PEG, with only a small decline. The background compliance, or the fraction of square areas in the pattern background which were free of neurite extension, declined from highs of 40% and 55% (midculture) to 5.5% and 12% (29 days) for serine and PEG, respectively. Images of the cultures suggest that PEG is significantly more effective as a nonpermissive substrate. The authors conclude that these materials, especially PEG, are adequate for the maintenance of long-term patterned cultures of neurons. They believe that this is the first report of high-quality long-term patterning of cultured neurons.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.827289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17965/00827289.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/10.827289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term maintenance of patterns of hippocampal pyramidal cells on substrates of polyethylene glycol and microstamped polylysine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Long-term maintenance of patterns of hippocampal pyramidal cells on substrates of polyethylene glycol and microstamped polylysine","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6532731","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"10743770","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term maintenance of patterns of hippocampal pyramidal cells on substrates of polyethylene glycol and microstamped polylysine","sourcePdf":"00827289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054699S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"138","articleId":"827289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":827296,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Wu Zhang","affiliation":["NEU-ALPINE Digital Medical System Company Limited, Shenyang, Liaoning, China","Biomedical Engineering Institute, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Ji-Wu Zhang","id":"37087219775"},{"name":"Chong-Xun Zheng","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Institute, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Chong-Xun Zheng","id":"37087145620"},{"name":"An Xie","affiliation":["Department of Physiology, Forth Medicine University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"An Xie","id":"37087218783"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"827296","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Electroencephalography","Ischemic pain","Injuries","Frequency","Biomedical imaging","Brain modeling","Biomedical signal processing","Neurophysiology","Noninvasive treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","medical signal processing","spectral analysis","diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focal ischemic cerebral EEG signal","third-order recursion method","bispectrum analysis","Sprague-Dawley rat focal ischemic cerebral injury","experimental model","bispectrum characteristics","heat shock protein test","ischemic region distinguishing","electrodiagnostics","30 min"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Electroencephalography","Female","Fourier Analysis","Heat-Shock Proteins","Ischemic Attack, Transient","Male","Models, Neurological","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827296","abstract":"In this paper, a model for Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat focal ischemic cerebral injury is presented.

To use these models, permittivity values are assigned to the various tissues for the EMF frequencies of interest. There is, as yet, no consensus on what are the best permittivity data. This study analyzed the variability In published permittivity data and investigated the effects of permittivity values that are proportional on SAR calculations. Whole-sphere averaged and localized SAR values along the diameter of a 4-cm sphere are calculated for EMF exposures in the radio frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 GHz. When the dimensions of a sphere are small compared to the wavelength (i.e., wavelength inside the material is greater than ten times the dimensions of the object), the whole-sphere averaged SAR is inversely proportional to the permittivity of the material composing the sphere. However, the localized SAR values generally do not have the same relation and, as a matter of fact, vary greatly depending on the location within the sphere. These results indicate that care must be taken In choosing the permittivity values used in calculating SAR values and some estimate of the dependence of the calculated SAR values on variability in permittivity should be determined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827308/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6532742","pubMedId":"10743782","publicationDate":"March 2000","displayDocTitle":"Variability in EMF permittivity values: implications for SAR calculations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variability in EMF permittivity values: implications for SAR calculations","sourcePdf":"00827308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035169S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"44","articleId":"827308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":827310,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.Z.

A five-layer, undoped AlGaAs and InGaAs single quantum well structure grown on a GaAs substrate is designed and fabricated. Six input factors (time and temperature for oxide removal, substrate temperatures for AlGaAs and InGaAs layer growth, beam equivalent pressure of the As source and quantum well interrupt time) are examined by means of a fractional factorial experiment. Defect density, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence are characterized by a static response model developed by training back-propagation neural networks. In addition, two novel approaches for characterized reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) signals used in the real-time monitoring of MBE are developed. In the first technique, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the RHEED data set, and the reduced RHEED data set is used to train neural nets to model the process responses. A second technique uses neural nets to model RHEED intensity signals as time series, and matches specific RHEED patterns to ambient process conditions. In each case, the neural process models exhibit good agreement with experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6526259","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks to construct models of the molecular beam epitaxy process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks to construct models of the molecular beam epitaxy process","sourcePdf":"00827338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063423S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"20","articleId":"827338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":827346,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The operating frequencies are in the L and C-bands, centered about 1.275 and 5.3 GHz, respectively. Since the C-band frequency is larger by a factor of four, its array elements and inter-element separations are smaller by the same ratio. Thus, to allow similar scan ranges for both bands, the L-band elements are selected as perforated patches to enable the placement of C-band elements within them. Stacked-patch configurations were used to meet the bandwidth requirements, especially in the L-band. The C-band element was designed numerically, but the perforated L-band one required final experimental optimization. Also, in the latter case of L-band, a balanced transmission line feed was used to minimize cross polarization. For the C-band elements, slot coupling was used and, to simplify the feed, symmetric parasitic slots were incorporated to minimize cross polarization. No vertical connections were utilized, and electromagnetic couplings resulted in a compact low-profile design, with an electrically and thermally symmetric geometry.","doi":"10.1109/8.827386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17962/00827386.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.827386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-band dual-polarized perforated microstrip antennas for SAR applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827386/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-band dual-polarized perforated microstrip antennas for SAR applications","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6554522","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-band dual-polarized perforated microstrip antennas for SAR applications","sourcePdf":"00827386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044837S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"116","articleId":"827386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":827387,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The field obtained by direct summation over the contributions from the individual radiators is restructured into a double series of wavenumber spectral integrals whose asymptotic reduction yields a series encompassing propagating and evanescent Floquet waves (FWs) together with corresponding diffracted rays, which arise from scattering of the FW at the edge of the array. The formal aspects of the solution are treated in the present paper. They involve a sequence of manipulations in the complex spectral wavenumber planes that prepare the integrands for subsequent efficient and physically incisive asymptotics based on the method of steepest descent. Different species of spectral poles define the various species of propagating and evanescent FW. Their interception by the steepest descent path (SDP) determines the variety of shadow boundaries for the edge truncated FW. The uniform asymptotic reduction of the SDP integrals, performed by the Van der Waerden (1951) procedure and yielding a variety of edge-diffracted fields, completes the formal treatment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.827387","doi":"10.1109/8.827387","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17962/00827387.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827387/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain Green's function for a planar periodic semi-infinite phased array .I.

This second part of a two-paper sequence deals with the physical interpretation of the rigorously derived high-frequency asymptotic wave-field solution in part I, pertaining to a semi-infinite phased array of parallel dipole radiators. The asymptotic solution contains two parts that represent contributions due to truncated Floquet waves (FWs) and to the corresponding edge diffractions, respectively. The phenomenology of the FW-excited diffracted fields is discussed in detail. All possible combinations of propagating (radiating) and evanescent (nonradiating) FW and diffracted contributions are considered. The format is a generalization of the conventional geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) for smooth truncated aperture distributions to the truncated periodicity-induced FW distributions with their corresponding FW-modulated edge diffractions. Ray paths for propagating diffracted waves are defined according to a generalized Fermat principle, which is also valid by analytic continuation for evanescent diffracted ray fields. The mechanism of uniform compensation for the FW-field discontinuities (across their truncation shadow boundaries) by the diffracted waves is explored for propagating ad evanescent FWs, including the cutoff transition from the propagating to the evanescent regime for both the FW and diffracted constituents. Illustrative examples demonstrate: (1) the accuracy and efficiency of the high-frequency algorithm under conditions that involve the various wave processes outlined above and (2) the cogent interpretation of the results in terms of the uniform FW-modulated GTD.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17962/00827388.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"85","doi":"10.1109/8.827388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.827388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain Green's function for a planar periodic semi-infinite phased array.

Simulations have been performed to test if this cavity model also predicts the remaining resonances. It was found that the cavity model predicts some but not all of the resonances. However, it was found that all resonances in both single- and dual-polarized arrays have some dependence on the dielectric region.

This review paper gives a comprehensive survey of the present state of the measurement systems and should help a designer to find the parameters required to achieve a specified accuracy or uncertainty of measurement. Delay lines and resonators have been used, and two principles have been employed: SAW one-port devices that are directly affected by the measurand and SAW two-port devices that are electrically loaded by a conventional sensor and, therefore, indirectly affected by the measurand. For radio frequency (RF) interrogation, time domain sampling (TDS) and frequency domain sampling (FDS) have been investigated theoretically and experimentally; the methods of measurement are described. For an evaluation of the effects caused by the radio interrogation, we discuss the errors caused by noise, interference, bandwidth, manufacturing, and hardware tuning. The system parameters, distance range, and measurement uncertainty are given numerically for actual applications. Combinations of SAW sensors and special signal processing techniques to enhance accuracy, dynamic range, read out distance, and measurement repetition rate (measurement bandwidth) are presented.

It is shown how the CMAC can cope with nonlinearities through optimization with no preliminary off-line learning phase required. The adaptive-learning algorithm is derived from Lyapunov stability analysis, so that both system-tracking stability and error convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. The filtered-tracking error or critic gain and the Lyapunov function for the nonlinear analysis are derived from the user input in terms of a specified quadratic-performance index.

The reject option is based on an estimate of the classification reliability, measured by a reliability evaluator /spl Psi/. Trivially, once a reject threshold /spl sigma/ has been fixed, a sample is rejected if the corresponding value of /spl Psi/ is below /spl sigma/. Obviously, as /spl sigma/ represents the least tolerable classification reliability level, when its value varies the reject option becomes more or less severe. In order to adapt the behavior of the reject option to the requirements of the considered application domain, a function P characterizing the reject option's adequacy to the domain has been introduced. It is shown that P can be expressed as a function of /spl sigma/ and, consequently, the optimal value for /spl sigma/ is defined as the one which maximizes the function P. The method for determining the optimal threshold value is independent of the specific 0-reject classifier, while the definition of the reliability evaluators is related to the classifier's architecture. General criteria for defining appropriate reliability evaluators within a classification paradigm are illustrated in the paper and are based on the localization, in the feature space, of the samples that could be classified with a low reliability. The definition of the reliability evaluators for three popular architectures of neural networks (backpropagation, learning vector quantization and probabilistic network) is presented. Finally, the method has been tested with reference to a complex classification problem with data generated according to a distribution-of-distributions model.","doi":"10.1109/5326.827457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5326.827457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/17956/00827457.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"To reject or not to reject: that is the question-an answer in case of neural classifiers","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6553958","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To reject or not to reject: that is the question-an answer in case of neural classifiers","sourcePdf":"00827457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043626S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"95","articleId":"827457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":827484,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

AOGC is necessary to suppress swings of output power and optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). A case study is selected, in which only the first EDFA in a cascade of six amplifiers is clamped using a ring laser configuration. A numerical model which solves the transcendental equation for the average inversion at each EDFA is used for the analysis. The traffic is generated on the eight WDM channels by ON-OFF time-slotted sources, with statistically independent ON and OFF durations, randomly generated by a truncated Pareto distribution with infinite variance. The simulation model includes the generation of amplified spontaneous emission within each amplifier and the propagation of the lasing power generated in the AOGC EDFA through the cascade. It is shown that the sizable power and OSNR swings arising in an unclamped cascade of EDFA's can be effectively suppressed when a lasing signal a few decibels above the aggregate signal power develops in the AOGC EDFA and propagates along the cascade.","doi":"10.1109/50.827501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.827501","startPage":"308","endPage":"313","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17957/00827501.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain stabilization in gain clamped EDFA cascades fed by WDM burst-mode packet traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Gain stabilization in gain clamped EDFA cascades fed by WDM burst-mode packet traffic","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6561428","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827501/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain stabilization in gain clamped EDFA cascades fed by WDM burst-mode packet traffic","sourcePdf":"00827501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040678S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"40","articleId":"827501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":827504,"authors":[{"name":"V.E.

The EDFA was named preamplifier, in-line amplifier or postamplifier; by the position it was located. We find that the preamplifier EDFA has limited usefulness because of its unstable amplification of the optical pulse trains. Both post- and in-line cases can work successfully in the TDM-PIFOMIS system. The amplitudes of the optical pulse trains are stable after amplified by the in-line EDFA, this is a significantly advantage of the optically amplified TDM-PIFOMIS system. The MPDS of the unamplified TDM-PIPOMIS system with an extinction ratio (ER) of 33 dB of the output pulse of the optical guide wave (OGW) modulator was 2.4/spl times/10/sup -5/ rad/(Hz)/sup 1/2/ at 1 kHz. For maintaining MPDS better than 3.4/spl times/10/sup -5/ rad/(Hz)/sup 1/2/ at 1 kHz, the allowable worst ER for the post- and in-line amplified system are 20 and 17.8 dB, respectively, and the corresponding input signal peak power should be larger than -20 and -25 dBm. While employing such two post- and two in-line EDFAs in the TDM-PIFOMIS system, the allowable loss of the sensor array is 47 dB. We analyze the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) of the optically amplified TDM-PIFOMIS system in detail and propose methods to reduce the PIIN. The output optical pulse of an intensity modulator with high ER is a key issue to minimize the PIIN and sensor crosstalk in the system. In order to reduce the system PIIN, complexity and cost, we suggest an optimum optically amplified WDM (wavelength-division multiplexing)-TDM hybrid PIFOMIS system with four wavelengths and four eight-sensor subarrays.","doi":"10.1109/50.827507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.827507","startPage":"348","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17957/00827507.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System design and optimization of optically amplified WDM-TDM hybrid polarization-insensitive fiber-optic Michelson interferometric sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"System design and optimization of optically amplified WDM-TDM hybrid polarization-insensitive fiber-optic Michelson interferometric sensor","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6561434","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827507/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System design and optimization of optically amplified WDM-TDM hybrid polarization-insensitive fiber-optic Michelson interferometric sensor","sourcePdf":"00827507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0364S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","articleId":"827507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":827513,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.D.

Since such virtual arrays have an incomplete set of covariance lags, we discuss various completion philosophies to fill in the missing elements of the associated partially specified Hermitian covariance matrix. This process is followed by the application of an algorithm that searches for a specific number of plane wavefronts, yielding the minimum fitting error for the specified covariance lags in the neighborhood of the completion-initialized DOA estimates. In this way, we are able to resolve possible ambiguity and to achieve asymptotically optimal estimation accuracy.

Since the spreading operation of the code division multiple access (CDMA) can induce cyclostationarity, any FIR channel can be identified by the proposed method.

In this paper, correlation-matching methods are employed to blindly estimate those multipath parameters. For given code sequences, the output correlation matrix (parameterized by the unknown channel coefficients) is compared with its instantaneous approximation. By minimizing the Frobenius norm of the resulting error matrix, the channel parameters can be estimated up to a complex scalar ambiguity. Both batch and adaptive algorithms are derived. Under the assumption of i.i.d. code sequences, identifiability up to a complex scalar ambiguity for each channel is guaranteed, and the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. Furthermore, step-size selection for the adaptive version is investigated. When only the code sequence of the user of interest is available, a single user receiver is also derived.

We develop several different schemes to estimate the cross-correlation vector, with which different Wiener filters are derived according to minimum mean square error (MMSE). Unlike many known sub-space methods, these equalization algorithms do not rely on signal and noise subspace separation and are consequently more robust to channel order estimation errors. Their implementation requires no adjustment for either single- or multiple-user systems. They can effectively equalize single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems and can reduce the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems into a memoryless signal mixing system for source separation. The implementations of these algorithms on SIMO system are given, and simulation examples are provided to demonstrate their superior performance over some existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct blind MMSE channel equalization based on second-order statistics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.827535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17959/00827535.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.827535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"Direct blind MMSE channel equalization based on second-order statistics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6564085","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct blind MMSE channel equalization based on second-order statistics","sourcePdf":"00827535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054761S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"17959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","articleId":"827535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":827537,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The affine projection algorithm (APA) is the earliest and most popular algorithm in this class that inherits its name. The usual APA algorithms update weight estimates on the basis of multiple, unit delayed, input signal vectors. We analyze the convergence behavior of the generalized APA class of algorithms (allowing for arbitrary delay between input vectors) using a simple model for the input signal vectors. Conditions for convergence of the APA class are derived. It is shown that the convergence rate is exponential and that it improves as the number of input signal vectors used for adaptation is increased. However, the rate of improvement in performance (time-to-steady-state) diminishes as the number of input signal vectors increases. For a given convergence rate, APA algorithms are shown to exhibit less misadjustment (steady-state error) than NLMS. Simulation results are provided to corroborate the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/78.827542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17959/00827542.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.827542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17959","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence behavior of affine projection algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convergence behavior of affine projection algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6570983","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence behavior of affine projection algorithms","sourcePdf":"00827542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036983S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"17959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"154","articleId":"827542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":827545,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Previous research has shown that unconstrained-length, paraunitary filterbanks optimized under various energy compaction criteria are principal-component filterbanks that satisfy two fundamental properties: total decorrelation and spectral majorization. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the two properties above are not specific to the paraunitary case but are satisfied for a much broader class of design constraints. Our results apply to a broad class of rate-distortion criteria, including the conventional coding gain criterion as a special case. A consequence of these properties is that optimal perfect-reconstruction (PR) filterbanks take the form of the cascade of principal-component filterbanks and a bank of pre- and post-conditioning filters. The proof uses variational techniques and is applicable to a variety of constrained design problems. In the second part of this paper, we apply the theory above to practical filterbank design problems. We give analytical expressions for optimal IIR biorthogonal filterbanks; our analysis validates a conjecture by several researchers. We then derive the asymptotic limit of optimal FIR biorthogonal filterbanks as filter length tends to infinity. The performance loss due to FIR constraints is quantified theoretically and experimentally. The optimal filters are quite different from traditional filters. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint theory","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","Rate-distortion","Signal design","Matched filters","Impedance matching","Statistics","Compaction","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decorrelation","principal component analysis","IIR filters","FIR filters","rate distortion theory","channel bank filters","codecs","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion-optimal constrained filterbanks","IIR biorthogonal designs","FIR biorthogonal designs","input signal statistics","M-channel subband coders","unconstrained-length paraunitary filterbanks","energy compaction criteria","principal-component filterbanks","total decorrelation","spectral majorization","design constraints","optimal perfect-reconstruction filterbanks","cascade","pre-conditioning filters","post-conditioning filters","variational techniques","asymptotic limit","filter length","performance loss","sensitivity analysis","optimal filters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.827545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17959/00827545.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.827545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of rate-distortion-optimal, constrained filterbanks-application to IIR and FIR biorthogonal designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=827545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theory of rate-distortion-optimal, constrained filterbanks-application to IIR and FIR biorthogonal designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827545/","volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6570986","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of rate-distortion-optimal, constrained filterbanks-application to IIR and FIR biorthogonal designs","sourcePdf":"00827545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051929S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"17959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"827545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":827546,"authors":[{"name":"Bing-Fei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bing-Fei Wu","id":"37275267600"},{"name":"Hung-Hseng Hsu","affiliation":["Computer and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Hseng Hsu","id":"37435391600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"827546","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":163},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The global maximum of an entropy function with different decision levels for a three-level scalar quantizer performed after a discrete wavelet transform was derived.

An extensive set of measurements, 7560 trials in all, were carried out using different equalizer and beamformer configurations. The results underscore the dramatic potential for a system that optimally combines equalization with adaptive beamforming. For example, an improvement of 43% (from 48% with equalization only to 5% with combined equalization and beamforming) was observed in the outage performance (uncoded BER of 10/sup -6/) of a 20 Mbps system operating in between 2 rooms. The same 20 Mbps system operating within a single room showed an outage of 2% (BER=10/sup -6/) with combined equalization and beamforming, 16% with beamforming only, 33% with equalization only, and 95% with simple demodulation. Additional field measurements at 10 Mbps and 30 Mbps presented in this paper corroborate this trend.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field measurements of high speed QAM wireless transmission using equalization and real-time beamforming","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

From a practical perspective, using the MMSE multiuser interference suppressor for demodulation yields good performance over a wide range of received signal powers. However, the progressively increasing correlation between estimates (with an increasing number of iterations) limits the improvement that can be obtained via further iterations, implying that the suboptimality of the MMSE demodulator plays a role in the performance levels that can be achieved. An immediate enhancement of the demodulator's performance is obtained by introducing multiple sensors at the receiver; the resulting space-time demodulator now operates on received signal mixtures with components whose spatial separation is accounted for, by virtue of their different directions of arrival. Since this separation is limited in practice, by restrictions on sensor count, array geometry, and the receiver's inability to control arrival directions, a multisensor block modulation scheme is proposed. This scheme transmits cyclically block-shifted versions of bit sequences from additional sensors using different random spreading sequences, and exploits the variation in the channel response between various transmission instances of a given bit. An iterative multiuser channel state estimator is also developed. Performance studies indicate significant reductions in the decoded bit error rate-up to that of a single user at moderately low received signal powers-and hence vastly increased spectral efficiencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time iterative MMSE multiuser detection in frequency selective coded CDMA wireless mobile channels","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

This approach is known as a spread-spectrum pilot technique or as a superimposed pilot sequence technique. In this paper, we apply the superimposed pilot sequence technique for the purpose of channel estimation (CE). We propose and verify a truly coherent receiver based on the Viterbi algorithm, which is optimal in the sense of per-survivor processing. We also suggest a generic low-cost receiver structure based on reduced-state sequence estimation. Among the distinct advantages compared to conventional pilot-symbol-assisted CE are (i) a lack of bandwidth expansion and (ii) a significantly improved performance in fast fading environments. The proposed Viterbi receiver may also be used as an alternative receiver for pilot-symbol-assisted CE.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.827587","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

These systems require a technique which is able to transfer a large volume of data such as X-ray images effectively. We developed a hierarchical image coding and transmission system in order to achieve an efficient transmission of medical images over the Internet. The coding system employs a lossless hierarchical coding scheme with wavelet transform to be applied for each segment within a whole image. Furthermore, it uses Golomb-Rice (GR) codes both for high efficiency coding and high speed decoding. The client-server system based on the proposed scheme is implemented with Java language. The system implementation proves that the proposed system is very suitable for telemedicine through a ISDN or LAN environment in terms of high speed medical image transmission and decoding with normal personal computers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The algorithm is attractive in real time applications including communication systems that exploit chaotic signalling. In the last decade chaotic coding and chaotic-based communication have been proposed based on discrete maps or based on continuous dynamical systems mostly implemented in the form of electric circuits. A major drawback of the proposed chaotic coding strategies is their poor performance with respect to signal reconstruction in the presence of noise. Several investigations have been made on noise reduction but in an iterative manner and so are not applicable in real time applications. The novel proposed algorithm achieves a SNR gain of 5.9 dB independent from the actual noise level in only one step.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.827602","pdfPath":"/iel5/6675/17952/00827602.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2243 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The receiver consists of a space-time array and a decorrelator. The blind adaptive procedure is implemented using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and the decision directed algorithm (DDA). For channel estimation, the respread sequences of decision symbols are used as references. The MIMO (multi-input multi-output) channels are estimated (also blindly) using minimum mean square error estimation (MMSE). The adaptation to the varying environment or signals is implemented using the stochastic gradient method.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

OFDM systems are particularly sensitive to carrier offsets since this introduces intercarrier interference and loss of signal power. An algorithm, termed MODSC, is devised in this paper which can estimate the local oscillator (LO) offset in a fast and efficient manner. The carrier offset can be brought to within one half the carrier spacing within 1 to 10 OFDM frames. Using a null in the center carrier, carrier acquisition can be easily accomplished by locating this null in the FFT bins at the receiver. The offset of this null from the designed position indicates the local oscillator offset in units of number of sub-carriers. An additional guard interval based (GIB) algorithm is used to estimate the offset within one half the inter-carrier spacing. Together, the MODSC and GIB completely estimates the LO offset.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.827609","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The approach is fitted and tested for the TMGA system (P. Zingaretti et al., 1998), which the authors developed for landmark tracking by adaptive, stereo template matching. Two complementary strategies, properly managed, are followed to construct a suitable subset of landmarks: the selection of the more discriminant landmarks and the selection of the landmarks that are more invariant in a neighbourhood. The robustness of the TMGA system in analysing the discriminant power of each landmark and the analysis of the disparity map and of the spatial activity maps of the stereo images are used for identifying discriminant and invariant landmarks. The experimental results show that the number of matching failures, and consequent landmark changes during the following of a route is comparable with (not much greater than) those obtained using an a-priori subset.","doi":"10.1109/EURBOT.1999.827636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURBOT.1999.827636","startPage":"161","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Third European Workshop on Advanced Mobile Robots (Eurobot'99).

The concept of hierarchy of control is introduced leading to a new control parametrization and an error equation with triangular HFGM, which allows a sequential design of the adaptation scheme. Significant reduction of the prior knowledge about the HFGM is achieved, overcoming the limitations of the known methods. A complete stability and convergence analysis is developed based on a new class of signals and their properties. Exponential stability is guaranteed under explicit persistency of excitation conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

The proposed ARC design only adapts actual physical parameters and uses a fixed design bound plus certain robust feedback to account for the possible destabilizing effect of online parameter adaptation. The resulting ARC controller achieves a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general; the exponential convergence rate of the transient tracking error and the bound of the final tracking error can be adjusted via certain controller parameters in a known form. In addition, in the presence of parametric uncertainties only, if the true parameters fall within the design bound, asymptotic output tracking is achieved. Furthermore, by choosing the design bound appropriately, the controller also has a well-designed built-in anti-integration windup mechanism to alleviate the effect of control saturation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827787/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6566813","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive robust control without knowing bounds of parameter variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive robust control without knowing bounds of parameter variations","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00827787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031774S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713","citationCount":"15","articleId":"827787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":827794,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we show that similar stabilization results may be achieved using unconstrained finite horizon optimal control.

We provide a complete analysis of the stability and region of attraction/operation properties of receding horizon control strategies that utilize finite horizon approximations in the proposed class. It is shown that the guaranteed region of operation contains that of the CLF controller and may be made as large as desired by increasing the optimization horizon (restricted, of course, to the infinite horizon domain). The key results are illustrated using a familiar example, the inverted pendulum, where significant improvements in guaranteed region of operation and cost are noted.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1999.827794","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

The terminals generate bursty non-real-time packet streams, and transmit over a common broadband communication channel to the access point using different spreading codes. The spreading codes have non-zero cross correlations, and thus the terminals are mutually interfering. This interference gives rise to bistability, which can severely degrade throughput performance. We are interested in characterizing schemes that eliminate or at least significantly mitigate bistability. We focus on diversity combining via retransmissions with memory (RWM). RWM is related, at some level, to spreading gain control, but requires no closed-loop control. We show that under RWM, the system may possess multiple equilibria for a given arrival rate. However, the stable equilibrium points, and corresponding throughputs, are typically very close together.

Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is carried out using the IMM estimator. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and an eigenstructure assignment (EA) techniques have been used for nominal and reconfigurable control laws design, respectively. To achieve zero steady-state tracking error, a set of feedforward control gains is also designed using an input weighting approach. The paper has considered not only actuator and sensor faults, but also system component faults. To achieve fast and reliable fault detection, diagnosis and controller reconfiguration, new fault diagnosis and reconfiguration mechanisms have been proposed using appropriate combination of the information provided by the mode probabilities from the IMM algorithm and an index related to the closed-loop system performance. The proposed approach is evaluated using an aircraft example in the presence of system component, actuator and sensor faults.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1999.827910","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

In this paper we show how the problem of MA parameter estimation from sample covariances can be formulated as a semidefinite program which can be solved in polynomial time as efficiently as a linear program. The method proposed relies on a specific (over)parameterization of the MA covariance sequence, whose use makes the minimization of the covariance fitting criterion a convex problem. The MA estimation algorithm proposed here is computationally fast, statistically accurate, and reliable (i.e. it \"never\" fails). None of the previously available algorithms for MA estimation (methods based on higher-order statistics included) shares all these desirable properties. Our method can also be used to obtain the optimal least squares approximant of an invalid (estimated) MA spectrum (that takes on negative values at some frequencies), which was another long-standing problem in the signal processing literature awaiting a satisfactory solution.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

In the case of uniformly sampled inputs and non-uniformly sampled outputs this synchronization must be achieved off-line and without knowledge of the absolute sampling instants. A new model-based iterative algorithm is proposed which is structured in two stages. Using linear identification methods a dynamic model is established. The local shift between the predicted output from this model and the measured output is estimated by correlation methods and subsequently removed from the measured output by resampling. The superior performance of the new algorithm compared to pure correlation methods is demonstrated with a simulation study and with measured data from a railway track and the corresponding dynamic vehicle response.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/827972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6566920","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Input-output synchronization with non-uniformly and asynchronously sampled output data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input-output synchronization with non-uniformly and asynchronously sampled output data","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00827972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036872S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713","articleId":"827972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":827994,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The algorithm is computationally inexpensive and amenable for real-time implementation. We present a performance evaluation of the algorithm under different levels of image measurement noise and camera motions relative to the landing pad. We also present a full dynamic model of a UAV, discuss a nonlinear controller based on differential flatness, and show through simulation that the vision guided UAV performs stable landing maneuvers even under large levels of image measurement noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

We introduce a number of new mobile services as proof of concept using network programmability and service creation. First, we describe 'multi-handoff access networks', which are capable of simultaneously supporting multiple styles of handoff over the same physical access network infrastructure. Next, we discuss 'reflective handoff services', which allow mobile devices to roam across heterogeneous access networks. Finally, we describe the notion of a programmable MAC, which supports the composition of new MAC services at run-time.

This is based on the detection of the singularities obtained from the composite abdominal signal, using the modulus maxima in the wavelet domain. Modulus maxima locations of the abdominal signal are used to discriminate between maternal and fetal ECG signals. Two different approaches have been considered, In the first approach, at least one thoracic signal is used as the a prior to perform the classification whereas in the second approach no thoracic signal is needed, A reconstruction method is utilized to obtain the fetal ECG signal from the detected fetal modulus maxima. The proposed technique is different from the classical time-domain methods, in that we exploit the most distinct features of the signal, leading to more robustness with respect to signal perturbations. Results of experiments with both synthetic and real ECG data have been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/10.828150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"507","endPage":"516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17988/00828150.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.828150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the composite abdominal signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Abdomen","Data mining","Signal analysis","Cardiac disease","Interference","Wavelet domain","Reconstruction algorithms","Signal detection","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obstetrics","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","wavelet transforms","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fetal ECG extraction","composite abdominal signal","wavelet transform-based method","singularities detection","modulus maxima locations","thoracic signal","recursive reconstruction method"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Abdomen","Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Female","Fetal Heart","Fetal Monitoring","Humans","Pregnancy","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Thorax"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the composite abdominal signal","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6562473","pubMedId":"10763296","publicationDate":"April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828150/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the composite abdominal signal","sourcePdf":"00828150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038122S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"17988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"127","articleId":"828150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":828284,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Therefore, in the presented paper, it is investigated what electrical and thermodynamic requirements have to be fulfilled by a superconductor if the fault current limiter is of a hybrid type. Assuming the availability of a suitable design for a superconductor used as a delayed reacting resistive limiting element in parallel with a fast acting load switch, the concept of a hybrid fault current limiter is introduced. The concept is based on a novel fast acting mechanical switch for several kA at medium voltage level to commutate the rising fault current to the superconducting element within several hundred microseconds after fault detection. It is found that a critical current density not higher than 1.5 kA per centimeter square is adequate for the proposed system. The superconductor carries only the fault current during switching and thus the total losses of the hybrid system are only 4 percent of the losses of a conventional SCFL, which offers high economical benefits. Cooling of the superconductor by gaseous nitrogen is feasible, and presents simplicity and flexibility of operation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/17989/00828362.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nitrogen gas cooled, hybrid, high temperature superconducting fault current limiter","doi":"10.1109/77.828362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.828362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"A nitrogen gas cooled, hybrid, high temperature superconducting fault current limiter","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556672","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nitrogen gas cooled, hybrid, high temperature superconducting fault current limiter","sourcePdf":"00828362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034316S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"21","articleId":"828362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828377,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

The system employs special arrays of permanent magnets (Halbach arrays) on the moving car. The magnetic field from the arrays induces repelling currents in a close-packed array of shorted circuits in the track. Above a low transition speed (a few kilometers per hour), levitation forces approach a constant value, while drag forces decrease inversely with speed, with L/D reaching 200:1 or more at operating speeds. The high magnetic efficiency of the Halbach arrays, plus the use of close-packed track circuits, results in levitating forces approaching 40 metric tonnes per square meter (using NdFeB permanent magnet arrays, whose weight in typical cases is a few percent of the levitated weight). The system is passively stable: only motion is required for levitation. Failure of the drive system only results in the train slowing down and settling onto auxiliary wheels at a low speed. A detailed theoretical analysis of the Inductrack was made, on the basis of which a small-scale model was constructed and operated. The Laboratory is building a new small-scale model system (under NASA sponsorship) to demonstrate the acceleration rates and speeds (10-g and Mach 0.4 in the model) needed to magnetically launch rockets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Inductrack: a simpler approach to magnetic levitation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/77.828377","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/17989/00828377.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.828377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"The Inductrack: a simpler approach to magnetic levitation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6556683","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Inductrack: a simpler approach to magnetic levitation","sourcePdf":"00828377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040661S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"17989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"50","articleId":"828377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828439,"authors":[{"name":"Wansoo Nah","affiliation":["School of lilcctrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wansoo Nah","id":"37086997429"},{"name":"Hoon Hwangbo","affiliation":["School of lilcctrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoon Hwangbo","id":"37087302190"},{"name":"Junghee Ye","affiliation":["School of lilcctrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Junghee Ye","id":"37088827505"},{"name":"Jinho Joo","affiliation":["Schuol or Melalliirgical and MaLericlls Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinho Joo","id":"37087179116"},{"name":"Hyun-Man Jang","lastName":"Hyun-Man Jang","id":"37088113978"},{"name":"Hong-Soo Ha","affiliation":["Applied Supercotiductivity Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong-Soo Ha","id":"37087297364"},{"name":"Sang-Soo Oh","affiliation":["Applied Supercotiductivity Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Soo Oh","id":"37087215473"},{"name":"Young-Kil Kwon","affiliation":["Applied Supercotiductivity Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Kil Kwon","id":"37087297564"},{"name":"Myung-Hwan Sohn","affiliation":["Applied Supercotiductivity Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Hwan Sohn","id":"37087348574"},{"name":"Kang-Sik Ryu","lastName":"Kang-Sik Ryu","id":"37087000931"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"828439","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Critical current","Magnetic fields","Current density","Power cables","Superconducting magnets","Magnetic analysis","Superconducting films","Shape","Conductors","High temperature superconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bismuth compounds","strontium compounds","calcium compounds","high-temperature superconductors","critical current density (superconductivity)","superconducting cables","superconducting tapes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load line analysis","Bi-2223 tape-stacked-cable","self field effects","critical current","self magnetic fields","critical current density","J/sub c/","critical current degradation","normal magnetic field","parallel field","Bi/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/Ca/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O"]}],"abstract":"In general, the critical current of a Bi-2223 tape-stacked-cable is much less than the total summation of critical currents of each tape, which is mainly due to the self magnetic fields of the cable itself.

Our previous work has suggested that local interconnect effects can be managed through a deep submicron design hierarchy that uses 50000 to 100000 gate modules as primitive building blocks. The primary goal of this paper is to examine global interconnect effects, within such a design hierarchy, to determine if there are any significant roadblocks which will prevent National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS) performance expectations from being met. Specifically, the issues of global resistance-capacitance delay, signal time-of-flight, inductance, clock and power distribution, and noise are studied. Results indicate that, while global clock frequencies will necessarily he lower than local clock speeds, NTRS expectations should be attainable to the 50 nm technology generation. Achieving these high clock speeds (10 GHz local clock) will be aided by the use of a newly proposed routing hierarchy which limits interconnect effects at each level of a design (local, isochronous, and global).","doi":"10.1109/43.828553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17990/00828553.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.828553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global wiring paradigm for deep submicron design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828553/","displayDocTitle":"A global wiring paradigm for deep submicron design","volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6552898","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global wiring paradigm for deep submicron design","sourcePdf":"00828553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031702S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"110","articleId":"828553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828554,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Ching-Han Tsai","id":"37365844900"},{"name":"Sung-Mo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Sung-Mo Kang","id":"37276368800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"828554","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":701},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Very large scale integration","Timing","Energy consumption","Integrated circuit reliability","Electronic design automation and methodology","Wire","Semiconductor device packaging","Microprocessors","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","VLSI","circuit layout CAD","temperature distribution","thermal analysis","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","timing","thermal resistance","matrix algebra","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell-level placement","substrate thermal distribution","power consumption","very large scale integration","VLSI circuits","thermal gradient","timing","reliability","electronic design automation tools","EDA tools","temperature-tracking","thermal placement tools","standard cell design style","macro cell design style","hot spots reduction","compact substrate thermal model","temperature profile","user-specified temperature constraint","power distribution constraint"]}],"abstract":"The dramatic increase of power consumption in very large scale integration circuits has led to high operating temperature and large thermal gradient, thereby resulting in serious timing and reliability concerns. Temperature-tracking is thus becoming of paramount importance in modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools.

They are aimed at reducing hot spots in a design without compromising traditional design metrics such as area and wire length. We developed a compact substrate thermal model that can be used by the placer to calculate the temperature profile of a placement efficiently, or to convert the user-specified temperature constraint into the corresponding power distribution constraint as an alternative placement objective. As a result, our method is much more efficient than directly employing temperature profile simulation during the placement process. The simulation results show noticeable improvement of thermal distribution over the traditional placement algorithm, with little impact on area and wire length of the final layout.","doi":"10.1109/43.828554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17990/00828554.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.828554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17990","startPage":"253","endPage":"266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell-level placement for improving substrate thermal distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cell-level placement for improving substrate thermal distribution","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6552899","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-level placement for improving substrate thermal distribution","sourcePdf":"00828554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041583S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"17990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"138","articleId":"828554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828556,"authors":[{"name":"F.Y.

To address this problem, the typical feedback loop of a disk drive servo system was augmented with a disturbance observer. The disturbance observer uses the position error signal and a nominal model of the plant to create an estimate of the disturbance. This estimate is then used to compensate for the disturbance effects. No additional sensors are required, which is particularly relevant in products such as disk drives where cost is a major concern. The effectiveness of the disturbance observer in rejecting shock and vibration disturbances is demonstrated in simulation and shake table experiments. The vibration experiments showed a decrease in the position error of 61%-96% at frequencies below 100 Hz. The maximum position error due to an experimental shock disturbance was decreased by 59%. The effects of noise in the position error signal are also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved track following in magnetic disk drives using a disturbance observer","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/3516.828584","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/17993/00828584.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.828584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Improved track following in magnetic disk drives using a disturbance observer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6553532","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved track following in magnetic disk drives using a disturbance observer","sourcePdf":"00828584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045642S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"144","articleId":"828584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828585,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A procedure that minimizes the duration of the movement, taking into account actuator constraints, can then be performed.

The controller (disturbance observer) is designed such that the system sensitivity function is made to match a chosen target sensitivity function by numerical optimization. One advantage of the proposed design method is that the tradeoff between command following, disturbance suppression, and measurement noise rejection is made transparent in the process of the control system design. This allows the system designer to bypass the effort of obtaining a highly accurate system model. Another aim of this research, relative to previous works, is to study how the design specifications can be best structured in the digital filter (a main component of the disturbance observer) for easy implementation. The robust feedback controller, designed in the velocity loop, is used in conjunction with a feedback controller located in the position loop and a feedforward controller acting on the desired output to construct a control structure for high-speed/high-accuracy motion control. Simulation and experiments applied to a high-speed XY table designed for micro positioning demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Motion control","Design methodology","Control systems","Adaptive control","Velocity control","Noise measurement","Process control","Digital filters","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion control","digital control","sensitivity","control system synthesis","observers","numerical analysis","noise","optimal control","digital filters","filtering theory","feedback","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity optimization approach","disturbance observer design","digital motion control systems","system sensitivity function","target sensitivity function","numerical optimization","command following","disturbance suppression","measurement noise rejection","control system design","digital filter","disturbance observer","robust feedback controller","velocity loop","feedback controller","position loop","feedforward controller","high-speed/high-accuracy motion control","high-speed XY table","micro positioning"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.828587","startPage":"32","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/17993/00828587.pdf","doi":"10.1109/3516.828587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sensitivity optimization approach to design of a disturbance observer in digital motion control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"A sensitivity optimization approach to design of a disturbance observer in digital motion control systems","accessionNumber":"6553535","publicationDate":"March 2000","volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensitivity optimization approach to design of a disturbance observer in digital motion control systems","sourcePdf":"00828587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041571S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"97","articleId":"828587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":828590,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Toward these ends, four issues are explored. First, the development of HEV is presented. This synopsis includes a novel definition of degree of hybridization for automotive vehicles. Second, a load-leveling vehicle operation strategy is developed. In order to accomplish the strategy, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed. Fuzzy logic control is chosen because of the need for a controller for a nonlinear, multidomain, and time-varying plant with multiple uncertainties. Third, a novel technique for system integration and component sizing is presented. Fourth, the system design and control strategy is both simulated and then implemented in an actual vehicle. The controller examined in this study increased the fuel economy of a conventional full-sized vehicle from 40 to 55.7 mi/h and increased the average efficiency over the Federal Urban Driving Schedule from 23% to 35.4%. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of intelligent control and mechatronic systems as they apply to automobiles.","doi":"10.1109/3516.828590","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/17993/00828590.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.828590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechatronic design and control of hybrid electric vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Mechatronic design and control of hybrid electric vehicles","volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6553538","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828590/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechatronic design and control of hybrid electric vehicles","sourcePdf":"00828590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033113S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"252","articleId":"828590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":828592,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yao","affiliation":["Ray W.

The two chambers of a single-rod actuator have different areas, so the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in them cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates controller design since it not only increases the system dimension but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller takes into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the inertia load and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. It guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, it reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/17993/00828592.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/3516.828592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.828592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=828592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive robust motion control of single-rod hydraulic actuators: theory and experiments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Robust control","Motion control","Hydraulic actuators","Differential equations","Tracking","Control systems","Stability","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydraulic control equipment","actuators","adaptive control","robust control","uncertain systems","dynamics","control system synthesis","control nonlinearities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive robust motion control","single-rod hydraulic actuators","constant unknown inertia load","dynamic equations","controller design","added internal dynamics","discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller","ARC","parameter variations","inertia load","hydraulic parameters","nonlinearities","uncompensated friction forces","external disturbances","output tracking transient performance","asymptotic output tracking","zero error dynamics","nonzero constant velocity trajectory tracking","global uniform stability","swing motion control","hydraulic arm","tracking errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/828592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive robust motion control of single-rod hydraulic actuators: theory and experiments","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6553540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive robust motion control of single-rod hydraulic actuators: theory and experiments","sourcePdf":"00828592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050127S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"17993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"421","articleId":"828592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":828599,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The frequency bands considered in this paper are 435 MHz, 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz and the usage is for retail goods only. The major considerations in choosing an antenna are: the type of antenna; its impedance; RF performance when applied to the object; and RF performance when the object has other structures around it. Antennas which are omnidirectional should be avoided and, wherever possible, directional antennas should be used because they have the advantage of less disturbance to the radiation pattern and to the return loss.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19990676","pdfPath":"/iel5/6723/17981/00828636.pdf","startPage":"3/1","endPage":"3/5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on RFID Technology (Ref.

Nevertheless, this spectral efficiency is only achieved at the cost of an advanced power control of the mobile stations. The DS-CDMA protocol uses in all mobile telephone systems a closed loop power control scheme controlled by the base station receiver. This control system is, unfortunately, not fully efficient in certain critical cases. This paper presents a much faster method than the traditional power control scheme for a given data command rate, while keeping the traditional scheme of power control bit transmission used with the IS-95, CDMA2000 and W-CDMA standards. This method makes it possible to improve the QoS (quality of service) in the difficult cases without cost.","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.2000.829222","publicationTitle":"2000 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

We use examples from DS/CDMA, and ISI channels to show performance under various situations.","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.2000.829224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZSBC.2000.829224","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

It has previously been shown that weighted multistage PIC can be seen as a realisation of the steepest descent method for minimising the mean squared error (MSE). Following this interpretation, a unique set of weights, based on the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, leads to the minimum achievable MSE for a short-code CDMA system. In this paper, we develop a method for finding a set of fixed weights, minimising the ensemble average of the MSE over all code-sets. Exact expressions of the ensemble averaged moments of the eigenvalues are derived. Simulation results show that a few stages can be sufficient for near-MMSE performance.","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.2000.829225","publicationTitle":"2000 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

The RAKE receiver is a well known technique in spread spectrum systems, which is used to obtain signal diversity in multipath environments. In TDD systems, a technique known as pre-RAKE has been proposed recently, in which the signal processing is transferred to the transmitter, and it has been shown that this technique provides a capacity increase in the downlink. In this paper we propose a combination of both methods and show that a substantial performance improvement can be reached this way.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Fading","Multipath channels","Downlink","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Spread spectrum communication","Signal processing","Communications technology","Resilience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","diversity reception","multipath channels","telecommunication switching","signal processing","radio transmitters","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","DS-CDMA","RAKE receiver","signal diversity","multipath environments","TDD systems","pre-RAKE","signal processing","transmitter","capacity increase","post-RAKE","mobile communications systems","code division multiple access","direct sequence spread spectrum techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=829226","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.2000.829226","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

In contrast, the unconstrained ML problem can be solved quite easily and is known as the decorrelating detector. In this paper, we consider the box-constrained ML problem and suggest a general iterative solution algorithm. Special cases of this algorithm correspond to known, nonlinear successive and parallel interference cancellation structures, using a clipped soft decision function for making tentative decisions. These structures are therefore maximum-likelihood under the assumption that the detected data vector is constrained to lie within a hypercube. Convergence issues are investigated and an efficient implementation is suggested. The BER performance is studied via computer simulations and the expected performance improvements over unconstrained ML is verified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

The variance and the error probability can be computed from the moment generating function of the receiver output. General and simple formulas for evaluating the multiple access interference variance are presented for systems using deterministic or random signature sequences.

Proliferation of wireless systems makes the issue of bandwidth efficiency a paramount consideration. Turbo codes, and in particular, the turbo product codes (TPCs) presented in this paper provide an excellent means of improving bandwidth efficiency. Of course, once it is established that turbo provide improved bandwidth efficiency, the next questions are, cost and bit error rate (BER) performance level. This paper presents a tutorial overview of TPCs with examples for using TPCs to achieve improved bandwidth efficiency. TPCs excel at high code rates and are readily coupled with high order modulation. The result, as is shown, is that TPCs can provide dramatic improvements in bandwidth efficiency and with a relatively low implementation cost.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19990786","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Turbo Codes in Digital Broadcasting - Could It Double Capacity?

The device model is based on the numerical solutions of semiconductor transport equations of the device. In this work, a Newton iterative method is used to solve the equations instead of employing the conventional Gummel's method. This method is found to be much faster than the Gummel's method in terms of computational time and convergence of the solutions, which can usually be achieved within three to four iterations. An example that simulates the transient response of a diode employing this resultant scheme is presented and the results are compared with that using the conventional lumped-element approach for active device.

In this scheme, all partial derivatives are approximated using cubic spline functions. This scheme uses the mesh stencil as used in the standard Yee cells and it is relatively easy to modify an existing code based on the Yee algorithm. This scheme can be adapted for an unbounded space problem such as a scatter in an unbounded space. In this case, the Maxwell's equations are transformed to a set of auxiliary equations in a closed domain. A reflection-free amplitude-reduction scheme applied over the entire computational domain reduces the auxiliary field components outwardly and makes them equal to zero at the closed boundary. Since the relationship between the physical fields and their auxiliary counterparts is explicity known and the former can be found from the latter with in the computational domain.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.1999.829890","publicationTitle":"1999 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference.

Point target experiments were successfully performed to verify the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/829925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6597293","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Processing spotlight SAR data without azimuth oversampling in range migration algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing spotlight SAR data without azimuth oversampling in range migration algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00829925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02805S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678","articleId":"829925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":829939,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyuan Yu","id":"37276676600"},{"name":"Weigan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Weigan Lin","id":"37291222800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5761-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"829939","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Numerical simulation","Resonance","RLC circuits","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Maxwell equations","Circuit simulation","Transforms","Difference equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide components","waveguide theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","circuit resonance","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial attenuation technology","numerical simulation","waveguide resonance circuits","FDTD method","S-parameters extraction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel method is proposed in which an artificial attenuation of time domain is inserted in the FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) method.

The proposed scheme leads to significantly lower spectral overlapping between adjacent subchannels than for known multicarrier techniques such as discrete multitone (DMT) or discrete wavelet multitone. This allows mitigating interference due to echo and near-end crosstalk signals, increasing system throughput and reach, and simplifying system operations for VDSL transmission. In the receiver of an FMT system, signal equalization is accomplished in the form of per-subchannel symbol-spaced or fractionally-spaced linear or decision-feedback equalization. We study by simulation the performance that can be achieved by FMT modulation for VDSL systems where upstream and downstream signals are separated by frequency-division duplexing. We also provide comparisons with DMT modulation for a typical transmission scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/829951/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6635568","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Filtered multitone modulation for VDSL","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtered multitone modulation for VDSL","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"00829951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03834S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675","citationCount":"57","articleId":"829951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":829996,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We developed a fuzzy logic rule base for adaptive, redundant striping of files across multiple disks. This rule base is based on a queuing model of disk contention that includes file request sixes and disk hardware parameters. At low loads, the rule base stripes aggressively to minimize response time. As loads rise, it stripes less aggressively to maximize aggregate throughput. This adaptive striping rule base is incorporated into our second generation Portable Parallel File System (PPFS II). Experimental results showed that the analytical models of disk striping are capable of accurately predicting file system behavior. Also, it is shown that; depending on the access pattern, adaptive striping can double the input/output performance compared to striping with fixed distribution parameters.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.1999.829996","publicationTitle":"16th IEEE Symposium on Mass Storage Systems in cooperation with the 7th NASA Goddard Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (Cat.
