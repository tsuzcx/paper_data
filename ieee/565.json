Unlike most previous approaches, which require correspondence matching, we seek to solve the problem of co-saliency detection under a preattentive scheme. Our algorithm does not need to perform the correspondence matching between the two input images, and is able to achieve co-saliency detection before the focused attention occurs. The joint information provided by the image pair enables our algorithm to inhibit the responses of other salient objects that appear in just one of the images. Through experiments we show that our algorithm is effective in localizing the co-salient objects inside input image pairs.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5650014","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05650014.pdf","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5650014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preattentive co-saliency detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650014/","displayDocTitle":"Preattentive co-saliency detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650014/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preattentive co-saliency detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047821S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5650014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650020,"authors":[{"name":"Yier Yan","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea","School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Yan","id":"37400765300"},{"name":"Ying Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Guo","id":"37403660700"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6015-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6013-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6014-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1943-7439"}],"articleNumber":"5650020","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Modulation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","binary codes","cooperative communication","diversity reception","Galois fields","iterative decoding","parity check codes","radio repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity decoder design","nonbinary LDPC codes","amplify-and-forward relay networks","cooperative diversity","M+2 relay network","low-density parity-check codes","random interleaver allocation","relay node","M-copy interleaved sequences","iterative coding algorithm","Galois field"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a simple cooperative diversity scheme in M + 2 relay network with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed.

PD location is based on time-off-light calculation in which travelling paths of electromagnetic signals between two sensors are assumed to be axially along the centre of GIS. The location is therefore normally obtained by solving a one dimensional problem, as if the GIS was in a continuous straight line. However, usually GIS must be made very compact, which can require many right angle bends or tee sections. The effect of corners and tee sections is to give greater significance to the three dimensional character of the PD location space. In particular, when a sensor is located close to a tee section, depending on where it is mounted on the tank circumference, the location result may vary because it does not consider the three dimensional relationship between this sensor and another sensor in a different arm of the tee section. This paper describes an investigation into the PD location accuracy in GIS tee sections using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method to simulate the propagation of electromagnetic signals radiated by a PD. A tee section model of GIS was defined and a PD current pulse measured in SF6 was used to quantify the waveshape of the excitation source. Simulations were carried out and electric fields were monitored at various points where UHF sensors might be installed around the tee section. PD location was evaluated by time-of-flight calculation and the location errors were analyzed. By these means, potential inaccuracies of PD location in GIS were investigated and quantified. Conclusions were drawn regarding the positioning of UHF sensors to reduce the location error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of PD location issues in GIS using FDTD simulation","publicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","displayPublicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637220/5648789/05650033.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"A study of PD location issues in GIS using FDTD simulation","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650033/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of PD location issues in GIS using FDTD simulation","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"B412208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041312S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637220","isNumber":"5648789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637220","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648789","articleId":"5650033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Cardiff University","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5650041,"authors":[{"name":"Kathrin Schmeink","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Laboratory Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Kathrin","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37593523100"},{"name":"Rebecca Block","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Laboratory Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Block","id":"37604481300"},{"name":"Christopher Knievel","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Laboratory Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Knievel","id":"37542265400"},{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Laboratory Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","id":"37273574400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7158-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7157-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650041","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Propagation delay","Channel models","Measurement","Training","Parameter estimation","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","gradient methods","maximum likelihood estimation","minimisation","navigation","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","pulse shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","parameter estimation","navigation","particle swarm optimization","combined communication","channel impulse response","channel coefficients","equivalent discrete time channel model","physical channel","propagation delay","line-of-sight path","pulse shaping filter","receive filter","maximum likelihood principle","nonlinear minimization problem","simple global optimization algorithm","gradient information","Monte Carlo simulation","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650041","abstract":"In this paper, a new method for joint channel and parameter estimation in the framework of combined communication and navigation is investigated.

A priori information about the pulse shaping filter and the receive filter are used. The estimator is based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which leads to a nonlinear minimization problem. The corresponding metric is minimized by particle swarm optimization, which is a simple global optimization algorithm that does not use any gradient information. The performance of the estimator is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The results are compared to the Cramer-Rao lower bound and it is shown that the estimator is asymptotically optimal and efficient.

It is based on a split-and-extend approach, which allows the relay to split the set of bits connected to some parity-check of the LDPC code into two or several subsets. Subsequently, the sums of bits within each subset are used in a repeat-accumulate manner in order to generate extra bits sent from the relay toward the destination. We show that the proposed design yields LDPC codes with enhanced correction capacity and can be advantageously applied to existing codes, which allows for addressing cooperation issues for evolving standards. Finally, we derive density evolution equations for the proposed design, and we show that Split-Extended LDPC codes can approach very closely the capacity of the Gaussian relay channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650084","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05650084.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Split-extended LDPC codes for coded cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Split-extended LDPC codes for coded cooperation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650084/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11732920","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Split-extended LDPC codes for coded cooperation","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"27c21569318430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075632S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5650085,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37535350100"},{"name":"Lihua Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Li","id":"37293043300"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["Wireless Modem System Research, Device Research and Development, Nokia Research Center, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37335103600"},{"name":"Haifeng Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Modem System Research, Device Research and Development, Nokia Research Center, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280093100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650085","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Modulation","Joints","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","modulation coding","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link adaptation","distributed beamforming","wireless data-centric networks","modulation and coding schemes","two-hop regenerative cooperative system","relay selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["relay selection","link adaptation","distributed beamforming","signaling","throughput"]}],"abstract":"Relay selection enhances the performance of the cooperative networks by selecting the links with higher capacity. Meanwhile link adaptation improves the spectral efficiency of wireless data-centric networks through adapting the modulation and coding schemes (MCS) to the current link condition. In this paper, relay selection is combined with link adaptation for distributed beamforming in a two-hop regenerative cooperative system. A novel signaling mechanism and related optimal algorithms are proposed for joint relay selection and link adaptation. In the proposed scheme, there is no need to feedback the relay selection results to each relay. Instead, by broadcasting the link adaptation results from the destination, each relay will automatically understand whether it is selected or not. The lower and upper bounds of the throughput of the proposed scheme are derived. The analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme provides synergistic gains compared to the pure relay selection and link adaptation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650085","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05650085.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650085","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint relay selection and link adaptation for distributed beamforming in regenerative cooperative networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint relay selection and link adaptation for distributed beamforming in regenerative cooperative networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650085/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650085/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732918","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint relay selection and link adaptation for distributed beamforming in regenerative cooperative networks","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"28c31569313643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096166S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5650090,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Li Wang","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068532600"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067204800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650090","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Encoding","Decoding","Bit error rate","Complexity theory","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check accumulate code","serial concatenation","iterative decoding","encoding complexity","LDPC code","error floor region","asymptotic minimum distance","code length","Gaussian approximation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650090","abstract":"This paper presents a class of high-rate codes called low-density parity-check accumulate (LDPCA) codes. The code design is the serial concatenation of an LDPC outer code and an accumulator with an interleaver. The iterative decoding for the LDPCA code design has complexity linear to the code length. When using regular LDPC codes with column weight 2, the proposed codes have low encoding complexity and are advantageous for hardware implementation. Simulation results show that the regular LDPCA codes have the same error performance with the regular LDPC codes at the waterfall region and outperform product accumulate codes at the error floor region. The investigation on weight distributions proves that regular LDPCA codes have the asymptotic minimum distance proportional to the code length. In addition, iterative decoding thresholds under density evolution are obtained with a Gaussian approximation.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650090","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05650090.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-density parity-check accumulate codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-density parity-check accumulate codes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650090/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732761","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-density parity-check accumulate codes","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"2c21569292153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063683S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650093,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Behley","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Behley","id":"37593243900"},{"name":"Kristian Kersting","affiliation":["Knowledge Discovery Department, Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Kersting","id":"37593233900"},{"name":"Dirk Schulz","affiliation":["US Armed Systems Department, Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37331040900"},{"name":"Volker Steinhage","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Steinhage","id":"37377267400"},{"name":"Armin B.

In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval. Intuitively, given a dataset of millions of labeled scan points and their neighborhoods, we simply search for similar points in the datasets and use the labels of the retrieved ones to predict the labels of a novel point using some local prediction model such as majority vote or logistic regression. However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650093","startPage":"5960","endPage":"5965","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650093.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to hash logistic regression for fast 3D scan point classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650093/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning to hash logistic regression for fast 3D scan point classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650093/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11689602","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to hash logistic regression for fast 3D scan point classification","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08248S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650095,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","lastName":"Oggier","id":"37283997600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650095","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"abstract":"We propose the notion of secrecy gain as a code design criterion for wiretap lattice codes to be used over an additive white Gaussian noise channel.

Radiometric calibration is an essential step for carrying out quantitative analysis. In this paper, a radiometric calibration approach for high resolution image data is presented, which includes Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) calibration, terrain illumination correction for removal of illumination effects caused by undulating surfaces, and detection of shadow and occlusion using high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). These methods are showcased in an urban environment monitoring project named Urban Monitor. This project employs photogrammetric sensors to acquire high resolution panchromatic and multi-spectral data. Some radiometric calibration results from the Urban Monitor project are presented. Particular issues such as several shadows cast by above ground objects are addressed and possible solutions are explored.

In this paper, a partially parallel QC-LDPC decoder with efficient memory design is proposed. To improve the memory utilization, the structures of efficient chunk and predictor are realized. The efficient chunk can store parts of check-to-variable messages. This design can effectively reduce the memory requirement. Furthermore, the predictor verifies variable-to-check messages and updates efficient chunks instantly. With less check-to-variable messages and variable-to-check messages stored in the memory, this decoding architecture only deposits few messages in several efficient chunks, such that the cost of memory is less. Eventually, the proposed approach dramatically reduces memory requirement about 65% compared to the traditional method while maintaining the same low-cost.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650137","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05650137.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of memory utilization for partially parallel QC-LDPC decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of memory utilization for partially parallel QC-LDPC decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650137/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11732907","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of memory utilization for partially parallel QC-LDPC decoder","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"89c21569314013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050953S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650147,"authors":[{"name":"Roope Vehkalahti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Roope","lastName":"Vehkalahti","id":"37540588400"},{"name":"Camilla Hollanti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Hollanti","id":"37284021000"},{"name":"Jyrki Lahtonen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyrki","lastName":"Lahtonen","id":"37283209600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650147","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"abstract":"Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in future wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small and will typically contain maximum two receive antennas. Especially tempting is the 4\u00d72 channel, where the four transmitters can either be all at one station, or separated between two different stations. Such channels optimally employ rate-two space-time (ST) codes consisting of 4\u00d74 matrices. Unfortunately, such codes are in general very complex to decode, the worst-case complexity being as high as N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n, where N is the size of the complex signaling alphabet. Hence, constructions with reduced complexity are called for. One option, of course, is to use the rate-one codes such as the quasi-orthogonal codes. However, if full multiplexing, i.e., transmission of two symbols per channel use is to be maintained, this option has to be put aside. Recently, some reduced complexity constructions have been proposed, but they have mainly been based on ad hoc methods and have resulted in a specific code instead of a more general class of codes. In this paper, it will be shown that cyclic division algebra (CDA) based codes satisfying certain criteria will always result in at least 25% worst-case complexity reduction, while maintaining full diversity and even the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property. The reduction follows from the fact that the codes will consist of four Alamouti blocks allowing simplified decoding. At the moment, such reduction is the best known for rate-two MIDO codes,. The code proposed in was the first one to provably fulfill the related algebraic properties, and shall be repeated here as an example. Further, a new low-complexity design resulting from the proposed criteria is presented, and shown to have excellent performance through simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","Complexity theory","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Correlation","Block codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","algebra","algebraic codes","communication complexity","cyclic codes","decoding","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","receiving antennas","space-time block codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic division algebra","fast-decodable space-time block code","multiple-input double-output code","MEDO code","wireless communication","portable end-user device","receiving antenna","radio transmitter","wireless channel","rate-two space-time code","ST code","complexity reduction","ad hoc method","nonvanishing determinant","NVD","Alamouti block","low-complexity design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650147","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05650147.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5650147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of cyclic division algebra based fast-decodable 4\u00d72 space-time block codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A family of cyclic division algebra based fast-decodable 4\u00d72 space-time block codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650147/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650147/","accessionNumber":"11732893","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of cyclic division algebra based fast-decodable 4\u00d72 space-time block codes","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"8c41569319011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074192S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650154,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600148000"},{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Chi-chao Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-chao","lastName":"Chao","id":"37268521600"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067204800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650154","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Reliability","Decoding","Null space","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","iterative decoding","linear codes","message passing","parity check codes","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message-passing decoding algorithm","low-complexity iterative reliability-based decoding algorithm","decoding complexity","q-ary sum product algorithm","one-step majority-logic decoding","q-ary linear block codes","finite field operations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel low-complexity iterative reliability-based decoding algorithm for LDPC codes over q-ary finite fields.

Both upper and lower bounds on the free distance are derived as well.

Since some undesired cycles occur due to the binomial terms in the parity-check matrices of general LDPC-CCs, we provide a specific procedure to remove this kind of length-8 cycles. It can also be applied to our irregular construction. Simulation results show that the codes based on the new construction and the cycle-removal procedure can achieve better bit-error-rate performance and a lower error-floor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732921","htmlLink":"/document/5650164/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new construction of irregular LDPC convolutional codes with cycle removal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new construction of irregular LDPC convolutional codes with cycle removal","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"91c41569318957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060113S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5650164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5650179,"authors":[{"name":"Delphine Cerutti-Maori","affiliation":["FGAN-Research Institute of High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Delphine","lastName":"Cerutti-Maori","id":"38270326100"},{"name":"Jens Klare","affiliation":["FGAN-Research Institute of High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Klare","id":"37392035600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5650179","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Arrays","MIMO radar","Signal to noise ratio","Radar imaging","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","MIMO radar","radar imaging","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent MIMO radar","moving object detection","frequency diversity","GMTI capability","configurable MIMO radar MIRACLE X"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","coherent","GMTI"]}],"abstract":"In addition to imaging, coherent MIMO radars have a strong potential for detecting moving objects and estimating their parameters.

Gait pattern is known to be related to gait parameters, such as cadence, stride length, and walking speed. Thus, prior before the discussion of gait pattern planning, the planning of gait parameters for natural walking should be addressed. This work utilizes multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) to predict natural gait parameters for a given subject. The inputs of the MLPNN are age, gender, body height, and body weight of the targeted subject. The MLPNN is trained to output a suitable walking speed and cadence for given subject. Two MLPNNs are trained to study the efficiency and accuracy in predicting the desired outputs, for two different setups. First setup is that the MLPNN is trained specifically for slow speed condition only. In second setup, the MLPNN is trained for both slow and normal speed conditions. The results of the MLPNNs are presented in this paper.

This paper presents a novel approach to generating summaries in form of a set of images, where the decision to include the image in the summary set is made online. Our focus is on the case where the number of observations is infinite or unknown, but the size of the desired summary is known. Our strategy is to consider the images in the summary set as the prior hypothesis of the appearance of the world, and then use Set Theoretic Surprise to compute the novelty of an observed image. If the novelty is above a threshold, then we accept the image. We discuss different criterion for setting this threshold. Online nature of our approach allows for several interesting applications such as coral reef inspection, surveying, and surveillance.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650315","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","startPage":"746","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ONSUM: A system for generating online navigation summaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ONSUM: A system for generating online navigation summaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650315/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689582","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5650315/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ONSUM: A system for generating online navigation summaries","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055156S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650324,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Ryde","affiliation":["Authors are with the Autonomous Systems Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Ryde","id":"37294170500"},{"name":"Michael Br\u00fcnig","affiliation":["Authors are with the Autonomous Systems Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Br\u00fcnig","id":"37370471200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650324","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Three dimensional displays","Quantization","FCC","Robots","Lasers","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial occupancy representation","body centred cubic","face centred cubic","mean centred cuboidal","3D lattices","mobile robot","FCC","lattice occupied voxel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650324","abstract":"The characteristics of a variety of 3D lattices are assessed for their performance when applied to typical robotics problems. The lattices studied are the Cubic, Body Centred Cubic (BCC), Face Centred Cubic (FCC), hexagonal prismatic and finally the Mean Centred Cuboidal (MCC). An algorithm for generic quantization to any low dimensional lattice is presented allowing this analysis to be easily extended to other 3D lattices of interest. Tests are undertaken on uniform sampled random data and laser range data from mobile robot platforms including an autonomous skid steer loader. The improvements in accuracy, memory requirements and consistency under rotation for the alternative lattices over the cubic lattice are typically 5-10%. The radial distribution of lattice points is studied through the distribution of points assigned to the same lattice cell and that in neighbouring cells. For instance only 12 neighbouring cells need checking for the FCC lattice as opposed to the cubic lattice which requires 26. Not only are fewer checks required but the distance variation associated with points in adjacent voxels of the FCC lattice is substantially lower than that of a cubic lattice. For the FCC lattice these point distances have a 30% smaller standard deviation and a 40% smaller range. These results make algorithms, such as collision checking and scan/map matching, which often involve many proximity checks, significantly faster and more accurate.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650324","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650324.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice occupied voxel lists for representation of spatial occupancy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Lattice occupied voxel lists for representation of spatial occupancy","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650324/","accessionNumber":"11689428","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650324/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice occupied voxel lists for representation of spatial occupancy","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063024S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5650329,"authors":[{"name":"Mirbek Turduev","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Mirbek","lastName":"Turduev","id":"38229314800"},{"name":"Yunus Ata\u015f","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Yunus","lastName":"Ata\u015f","id":"37593412200"},{"name":"Pedro Sousa","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37532533400"},{"name":"Veysel Gazi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Veysel","lastName":"Gazi","id":"37326218500"},{"name":"Lino Marques","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, Turkey","Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Lino","lastName":"Marques","id":"37296172300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650329","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650329","abstract":"In this article the main objective is to perform a search in an unknown area with multiple robots in order to determine the region with highest chemical gas concentration as well as to build the chemical gas concentration map. The searching and map building tasks are accomplished by using mobile robots equipped with smart transducers for gas sensing. Robots perform the search autonomously by using their own data and the information (position information and sensor readings) obtained from the other robots. Moreover, simultaneously the robots send their sensor readings of the chemical concentration and their position data to a remote computer (a base station), where the data is combined, interpolated, and filtered to form an real-time map of the chemical gas concentration in the environment. To achieve this task as a high-level path planning algorithm we use a decentralized and asynchronous version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm which also allows for time-varying neighborhood.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650329","startPage":"4175","endPage":"4180","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650329.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative chemical concentration map building using Decentralized Asynchronous Particle Swarm Optimization based search by mobile robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Chemicals","Collision avoidance","Base stations","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","gas sensors","intelligent sensors","interpolation","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","SLAM (robots)","telerobotics","transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robot","decentralized asynchronous particle swarm optimization based search","cooperative chemical concentration map building","multiple robot","chemical gas concentration map","smart transducer","gas sensing","remote computer","data interpolation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative chemical concentration map building using Decentralized Asynchronous Particle Swarm Optimization based search by mobile robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650329/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689730","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative chemical concentration map building using Decentralized Asynchronous Particle Swarm Optimization based search by mobile robots","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070226S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5650333,"authors":[{"name":"Jaswanth Sreeram","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jaswanth","lastName":"Sreeram","id":"37594545900"},{"name":"Santosh Pande","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Santosh","lastName":"Pande","id":"37267758000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9296-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9297-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5650333","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Approximation methods","Instruction sets","Open area test sites","Hardware","Writing","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","multiprocessing programs","parallel programming","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate value locality","data synchronization","multi-core processors","parallel soft computing programs","optimistic synchronization","C/C++ language"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows that for a variety of parallel \u201csoft computing\u201d programs that use optimistic synchronization, the approximate nature of the values produced during execution can be exploited to improve performance significantly. Specifically, through mechanisms for imprecise sharing of values between threads, the amount of contention in these programs can be reduced thereby avoiding expensive aborts and improving parallel performance while keeping the results produced by the program within the bounds of an acceptable approximation. This is made possible due to our observation that for many such programs, a large fraction of the values produced during execution exhibit a substantial amount of value locality. We describe how this locality can be exploited using extensions to C/C++ language types that allow specification of limits on the precision and accuracy required and a novel value-aware conflict detection scheme that minimizes the number of conflicts while respecting these limits. Our experiments indicate that for the programs studied substantial speedups can be achieved - upto 5.7x over the original program for the same number of threads. We also present experimental evidence that for the programs studied, the amount of error introduced often grows relatively slowly.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2010.5650333","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC'10)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644749/5648811/05650333.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2010.5650333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648811","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting approximate value locality for data synchronization on multi-core processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting approximate value locality for data synchronization on multi-core processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650333/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678173","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5650333/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting approximate value locality for data synchronization on multi-core processors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058148S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644749","isNumber":"5648811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644749","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5648811","articleId":"5650333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650340,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ting Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Ting Chiang","id":"37066389500"},{"name":"Kuo-Chung Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Chung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37592125300"},{"name":"Ching-Hu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37406434200"},{"name":"Li-Chen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Chen Fu","id":"37278448600"},{"name":"Jane Yung-Jen Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering and The Graduate Institute of Networking and Engineering and The Graduate Institute of Networking and Engineering and The Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jane Yung-Jen Hsu","id":"37342413300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650340","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Humans","Intelligent sensors","Feature extraction","Smart homes","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","hidden Markov models","home computing","human computer interaction","pattern classification","sensor fusion","service robots","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interaction model","multiple resident activity recognition","smart home","context aware application","problem complexity","obtrusive sensor","Bayesian network","hidden Markov models","data association","multiresident dataset","Washington State University","nonobtrusive sensor"]}],"abstract":"Multi-resident activity recognition is among a key enabler in many context-aware applications in a smart home. However, most of prior researches ignore the potential interactions among residents in order to simplify problem complexity. On the other hand, multiple-resident activities are usually recognized using cameras or wearable sensors. However, due to human-centric concerns, it is more preferable to avoid using obtrusive sensors. In this paper, we propose dynamic Bayesian networks which extend coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs) by adding some vertices to model both individual and cooperative activities. In order to improve performance of the model, we categorize sensor observations based on data association and some domain knowledge to model multiple-resident activity patterns. We then validate the performance using a multi-resident dataset from WSU (Washington State University), which only includes non-obtrusive sensors. The experimental result shows that our model performs better than other baseline classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650340","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","startPage":"3753","endPage":"3758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction models for multiple-resident activity recognition in a smart home","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interaction models for multiple-resident activity recognition in a smart home","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650340/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689705","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5650340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction models for multiple-resident activity recognition in a smart home","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082602S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5650422,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Dellaert","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Dellaert","id":"37282902200"},{"name":"Justin Carlson","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Carlson","id":"37592537600"},{"name":"Viorela Ila","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA","Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial, CSIC/UPC, Spain"],"firstName":"Viorela","lastName":"Ila","id":"37269313000"},{"name":"Kai Ni","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Ni","id":"37287081800"},{"name":"Charles E.

While direct methods, popular in the literature, exhibit quadratic convergence and can be quite efficient for sparse problems, they typically require a lot of storage and efficient elimination orderings to be found. In contrast, iterative optimization methods only require access to the gradient and have a small memory footprint, but can suffer from poor convergence. Our new method, subgraph preconditioning, is obtained by re-interpreting the method of conjugate gradients in terms of the graphical model representation of the SLAM problem. The main idea is to combine the advantages of direct and iterative methods, by identifying a sub-problem that can be easily solved using direct methods, and solving for the remaining part using PCG. The easy sub-problems correspond to a spanning tree, a planar subgraph, or any other substructure that can be efficiently solved. As such, our approach provides new insights into the performance of state of the art iterative SLAM methods based on re-parameterized stochastic gradient descent. The efficiency of our new algorithm is illustrated on large datasets, both simulated and real.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650422/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689059","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradients for large scale SLAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradients for large scale SLAM","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074757S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5650423,"authors":[{"name":"Bar\u0131\u015f Y\u00fcksekkaya","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Hacettepe \u00dcniversitesi"],"firstName":"Bar\u0131\u015f","lastName":"Y\u00fcksekkaya","id":"38256213300"},{"name":"Cenk Toker","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Hacettepe \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cenk","lastName":"Toker","id":"37273614600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5650423","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Interference","Joints","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transceiver design","multiuser MIMO channel equalization","joint transmitter receiver filter optimization","multiuser channel","multiple input multiple output channel","frequency selective slowly varying channel","minimum mean square error criterion","total transmit power constraint","multiple access channel optimisation","channel duality","interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, joint transmitter receiver filter optimization for channel equalization is investigated for a multiuser multiple input multiple output frequency selective slowly varying channel.

Such a versatility is highly desirable in the context of humanoid robots, in particular when performing object manipulation. Biomechanical data, surgery procedures and rehabilitation surveys represent an excellent base from which a robotic design can be inferred. This knowledge must be understood to identify the properties required for manipulation skills, and especially, to obtain a holistic view of the thumb functionality. Several designs have been realized, that concentrated on biomimetism or on classical mechanism designs. Therefore, it is currently difficult for designers to obtain a clear overview of the properties required for a functional robot thumb. In the present case, a robotic hand with size, forces, velocity and shape comparable to the human ones, is envisioned. Unlike most of robotic designs-where the fingers are modular and the thumb is simply a finger placed in opposition-the thumb benefits from an intensive functional analysis. This paper gathers anatomy, surgery and rehabilitation data and identifies the properties required for human like manipulation. Based on this synergy, guidelines are presented that are fused and applied to the hand design of the Integrated Hand arm project of DLR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thumb","Joints","Muscles","Tendons","Bones","Robots","Surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial limbs","biomechanics","manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic design","humanoid robot","object manipulation","functional robot thumb","robotic hand"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650454","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650454","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650454","startPage":"5886","endPage":"5893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The thumb: guidelines for a robotic design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The thumb: guidelines for a robotic design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650454/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650454/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689838","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The thumb: guidelines for a robotic design","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082592S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5650468,"authors":[{"name":"Zafer Arican","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory-LTS4, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Zafer","lastName":"Arican","id":"37594660400"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory-LTS4, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5650468","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650468","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Feature extraction","Cameras","Fourier transforms","Smoothing methods","Computer vision","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-aware polar descriptors","feature matching solution","omnidirectional images","log-polar planar descriptors","geometry","nonuniform sampling density","spherical images","rotation-invariant matching","mobile devices","computational complexity","Kullback-Leibler divergence","SIFT descriptors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional imaging","scale-invariant features","polar descriptors","Kullback-Leibler divergence"]}],"abstract":"We present a new descriptor and feature matching solution for omnidirectional images.

The algorithm is based on a Hidden Markov Model that combines Wi-Fi positioning and dead reckoning. The hidden states are the positions of the Wi-Fi fingerprints in the database. The state transition includes dead reckoning based on step length estimation from acceleration measurements and compass heading calculated from magnetic field measurements. In the measurement update a database correlation of the actual Wi-Fi signal strength measurements with the stored values in the fingerprints has been performed. In simulations and tests we demonstrate that in this way ambiguities common in Wi-Fi positioning can be reduced. Therefor, higher accuracy and robustness can be achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model for pedestrian navigation","publicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2010.5650501","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647780/5649084/05650501.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2010.5650501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model for pedestrian navigation","conferenceDate":"11-12 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650501/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11688457","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hidden Markov Model for pedestrian navigation","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051871S","chronDate":"11-12 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647780","isNumber":"5649084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647780","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5649084","articleId":"5650501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650505,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Adrian Cojan","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Romania SCS, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu Adrian","lastName":"Cojan","id":"37594498400"},{"name":"Cristian Murtaza","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Romania SCS, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Murtaza","id":"37594261500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5782-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5783-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-0678"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-827X"}],"articleNumber":"5650505","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Gain","Receivers","Frequency modulation","Antennas","Noise figure","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","radio receivers","radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply inductorless low noise amplifier","1dB-STEP programmable gain","FM-radio receivers","antenna impedance","voltage 1.5 V","current 3 mA","size 60 nm","noise figure 2 dB","gain 27 dB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650505","doi":"10.1109/SMICND.2010.5650505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMICND.2010.5650505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649087","publicationTitle":"CAS 2010 Proceedings (International Semiconductor Conference)","displayPublicationTitle":"CAS 2010 Proceedings (International Semiconductor Conference)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640539/5649087/05650505.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.5-V Power Supply inductorless Low Noise Amplifier with 1dB-STEP programmable gain for FM-Radio receivers","abstract":"In this paper a Low Noise Amplifier suitable for usage in FM-Radio receivers in a standard 60 nm RF process is presented.

However, many successful GPR-based buried threat detection algorithms require data collected both before and after an object of interest is encountered to make a declaration (typically this data is used to perform background normalization, or to adequately characterize the object's shape). Samples taken past an object of interest, but before a decision is made, constitute an algorithm's \u201cspatial latency\u201d. For vehicular mounted antennae arrays, where vehicle stopping distance is a function of vehicle dynamics, driver responsiveness, and algorithmic spatial latency, reducing an algorithm's spatial latency can increase overall system safety and help keep operators out of harm's way. In this work we propose a stochastic sampling algorithm that can help reduce spatial latency for a wide range of GPR-based buried threat detection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650607","startPage":"3354","endPage":"3357","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05650607.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial latency reduction in GPR processing using stochastic sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spatial latency reduction in GPR processing using stochastic sampling","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650607/","accessionNumber":"11686841","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650607/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial latency reduction in GPR processing using stochastic sampling","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0003354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047198S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5650607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5650636,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Haddadin","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Haddadin","id":"37542865300"},{"name":"Sven Parusel","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Parusel","id":"37587057600"},{"name":"Rico Belder","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Rico","lastName":"Belder","id":"38273725200"},{"name":"J\u00f6rn Vogel","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rn","lastName":"Vogel","id":"37602887100"},{"name":"Tim Rokahr","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Rokahr","id":"38272987200"},{"name":"Alin Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","id":"38270361100"},{"name":"Gerd Hirzinger","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Hirzinger","id":"37279677100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650636","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Robot sensing systems","Humans","Computer crashes","Injuries","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","collision avoidance","human-robot interaction","manipulator dynamics","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["holistic design","holistic analysis","robotic coworker","human robot interaction","motion control","automobile crash test dummy","biomechanics","DLR Lightweight Robot III","support reactive motion scheme","human friendly control architecture","manipulator"]}],"abstract":"In this overview paper we present current work on safety analysis for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) and motion control methods for robotic co-workers. In particular, we introduce the analysis tools for investigating the potential injury a human would suffer during robot-human impacts. Furthermore, we outline our concept for establishing a procedure towards standardized crash testing in robotics with automobile crash-test dummies. Since it is only possible to investigate blunt impacts with these devices, we developed a drop testing setup for analyzing soft-tissue injury in robotics from a biomechanics perspective. In the second part of the paper, some of our methods for task preserving and task relaxing motion schemes are described, which enable collision avoidance in real-time. The algorithms are well suited to work in an integrated fashion with the soft robotics control developed for the DLR Lightweight Robot III (LWR-III). In addition, it is shown how the torque sensing capabilities of the robot can be used to support reactive motion schemes. Finally, an overview of our human-friendly control architecture for the LWR-III is given, which unifies the rich bundle of developed methods for this manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650636","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650636.pdf","startPage":"4735","endPage":"4742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Holistic design and analysis for the human-friendly robotic co-worker","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Holistic design and analysis for the human-friendly robotic co-worker","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689750","htmlLink":"/document/5650636/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Holistic design and analysis for the human-friendly robotic co-worker","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100731S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5650638,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Bleiweiss","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Bleiweiss","id":"37594422500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650638","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Graphics processing unit","Connectors","Floods","Instruction sets","Data structures","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","mobile robots","parallel algorithms","path planning","probability","query processing","solid modelling","user interfaces","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["roadmap construction","3D virtual environment","GPU","probabilistic graphical model","graphical representation","inference algorithm","robot path query","resolution complete method","data parallel algorithm","reachability roadmap method","NVIDIA Fermi architecture"]}],"abstract":"The representation of probabilistic graphical model often encodes a network whose size is unboundedly large. Such networks pose particular challenges to inference algorithms, specifically making the task of robot path queries highly inefficient due to poor locality of memory references. Whereas a more predictable, resolution complete method yields a highly compact graph structure that captures much of the signal in distributing the configuration free space. In this paper we demonstrate an efficient data parallel algorithm for mapping the computationally intensive, Reachability Roadmap method on the GPU. For our implementation on the recently introduced NVIDIA's Fermi architecture, we show roadmap construction time under twenty seconds for a closure resolution of 55\u00d755\u00d755 cells. Moving forward, our system is well positioned to address smooth navigation of robots in a dynamically changing 3D virtual environment.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650638","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650638.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","startPage":"5007","endPage":"5013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel compact roadmap construction of 3D virtual environments on the GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel compact roadmap construction of 3D virtual environments on the GPU","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650638/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689776","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5650638/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel compact roadmap construction of 3D virtual environments on the GPU","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090914S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650702,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed innovative approach for the three dimensional reconstruction is based on the joint exploitation of both amplitude and interferometric phase images of a multichannel SAR system. The information provided by the amplitude data is added to the 3D reconstruction chain, considering that in urban areas edges of amplitude image are likely also present in the interferometric phase one and conversely. Differently from other works present in literature, the proposed technique exploits the amplitude image, not only to improve the phase regularization, but also to improve the phase unwrapping step. The results will show the effectiveness of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5650702/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11686879","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Three dimensional reconstruction of urban areas using jointly phase and amplitude multichannel images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three dimensional reconstruction of urban areas using jointly phase and amplitude multichannel images","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0004831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057388S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5650702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5650725,"authors":[{"name":"Jihong Min","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jihong Min","id":"38247169000"},{"name":"Yekeun Jeong","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yekeun Jeong","id":"37404231900"},{"name":"In So Kweon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In So","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37270474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5650725","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"abstract":"We present a method for simultaneously locking on to a ground target and estimating the position of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under countermeasure (CM) conditions, where sensors are prevented from successfully tracking a target. Owing to the limited payload and power of the UAVs, we employ a monocular camera and a global positioning system (GPS) to carry out vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using both an unscented Kalman filter and a Kalman filter. Since this approach estimates the state of the UAV and the location of the target, we can estimate the position of the target in the image, even in the presence of CMs. Our experiments show that the proposed method successfully locks on to the target and estimates the state of the UAV.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650725.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust visual lock-on and simultaneous localization for an unmanned aerial vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Global Positioning System","Solid modeling","Design automation","Three dimensional displays","Cameras","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft","cameras","Global Positioning System","Kalman filters","mobile robots","object detection","position measurement","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust visual lock-on","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV","countermeasure","sensor","monocular camera","global positioning system","GPS","vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping","SLAM","unscented Kalman filter","position estimation","target location"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust visual lock-on and simultaneous localization for an unmanned aerial vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650725/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689792","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust visual lock-on and simultaneous localization for an unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06846S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650768,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshio Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Niigata University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37268137200"},{"name":"Akinobu Sato","affiliation":["Niigata University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akinobu","lastName":"Sato","id":"37597132700"},{"name":"Ryoichi Sato","affiliation":["Niigata University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Sato","id":"37279747400"},{"name":"Hiroyoshi Yamada","affiliation":["Niigata University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyoshi","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37280270300"},{"name":"Wolfgang -M.

This information is very useful in determining the orientation and size of an object such as reinforcing steel, buried utilities, and subsurface tunnels.

Due to the 50 mm translation and 60 degree rotation motion ranges of the desktop-sized device, the transformation between the vector of coil currents and the actuation forces and torques generated on the levitated body varies significantly throughout its motion range. To improve the dynamic performance of the device, the current to force and torque transformation can be recalculated at each control update as the levitated body moves about its workspace, rather than using a constant transformation calculated from the unrotated and centered position of the levitated body. The design of the device is presented and the new methods used to calculate coil current to force and torque transformations for levitation are described. Long-range trajectory following feedback control motion results are shown.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5650870","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05650870.pdf","startPage":"4668","endPage":"4673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5650870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actuation model for control of a long range Lorentz force magnetic levitation device","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650870/","displayDocTitle":"Actuation model for control of a long range Lorentz force magnetic levitation device","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689442","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650870/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actuation model for control of a long range Lorentz force magnetic levitation device","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058523S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5650870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650871,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Caorsi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Caorsi","id":"37274836000"},{"name":"Mattia Stasolla","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Mattia","lastName":"Stasolla","id":"37400389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5650871","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650871","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Artificial neural networks","Permittivity","Feature extraction","Geometry","Monitoring","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","ground penetrating radar","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic infrastructure monitoring","multilayered geometries","ground penetrating radar","artificial neural networks","geophysical properties","single subsurface layers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPR","artificial neural networks","infrastructure monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650871","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05650871.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","startPage":"4717","endPage":"4720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic infrastructure monitoring: The exploitation of GPR data and neural networks for multi-layered geometries","abstract":"In this paper, an inversion ANN-based algorithm for the estimation of geophysical properties (i.e. thickness and permittivity) of subsurface layers in stratified geometries is presented.

Although Turkey is the third largest chili pepper producer in the world, it has less than three percent international market share due to the high level of aflatoxin contamination in the chili pepper. Various chemical methods are used for detection of aflatoxin. Chemical methods used for detection of aflatoxin contamination give accurate results, but they are slow, expensive and destructive.

Unfortunately, size reduction results in degradation in both efficiency and bandwidth, as is well known from the fundamental limits on small antennas. This paper firstly introduces a MATLAB-controlled NEC2 simulation tool with genetic algorithm optimization, and uses this to find the optimal position of inductors for a shortened monopole with L-section matching networks. Trade-offs between bandwidth and efficiency are investigated and demonstrated in a systematic fashion for a single inductor case. Various multi-inductor loading schemes are also investigated; including central symmetrically distributed and arbitrarily distributed two-inductor loading schemes. The ultimate goal of the research is to find an optimal distribution of inductors on a reduced-size resonant monopole.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5650958/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11685787","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5650958/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal positions of loading for a shortened resonant monopole using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal positions of loading for a shortened resonant monopole using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05936S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640099","isNumber":"5648824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648824","articleId":"5650958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5650982,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Kuzlu","affiliation":["Enerji Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, T\u00dcB\u0130TAK - Marmara Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Merkezi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Kuzlu","id":"37089047190"},{"name":"Hasan Din\u00e7er","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kocaeli \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Din\u00e7er","id":"37294224000"},{"name":"S\u0131tk\u0131 \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kocaeli \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"S\u0131tk\u0131","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"38231905400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5650982","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","Underwater acoustics","Telemetry","Metals","Receivers","Sonar equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic receivers","data acquisition","hydrophones","preamplifiers","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater communication receiver preamplifier","underwater acoustic communication","underwater wireless communication","modular receiver preamplifier","data acquisition","hydrophone","frequency 200 Hz to 16 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650982","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5650982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5650982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05650982.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Desing of an underwater communication receiver pre-amplifier [Desing read Design]","abstract":"Underwater acoustic communication is a rapidly growing field of applied research and engineering.

Earth surface by means of single-pass X-band SAR interferometry. It is, moreover, the first genuinely bistatic spaceborne SAR mission, and, independently of its usual quasi-monostatic configuration, includes many of the peculiarities of bistatic SAR. An experimental, versatile, and flexible interferometric chain has been developed at DLR Microwaves and Radar Institute for the scientific exploitation of TanDEM-X data acquired in non-standard configurations. The paper describes the structure of the processing chain and focusses on some essential aspects of its bistatic part. Some experimental results performed with TerraSAR-X demonstrate the flexibility of the implemented processor.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5651002","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05651002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5651002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","startPage":"4059","endPage":"4062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taxi: A versatile processing chain for experimental TanDEM-X product evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Taxi: A versatile processing chain for experimental TanDEM-X product evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651002/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11686876","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651002/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taxi: A versatile processing chain for experimental TanDEM-X product evaluation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0004059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045708S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5651002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5651013,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Granstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Granstr\u00f6m","id":"37571611600"},{"name":"Thomas B.

Loop closing is the problem of detecting the return to a previously visited location, and constitutes an important part of the solution to the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) problem. It is important to achieve a low level of false alarms, since closing a false loop can have disastrous effects in a SLAM algorithm. In this work, the point clouds are described using features, which efficiently reduces the dimension of the data by a factor of 300 or more. The machine learning algorithm AdaBoost is used to learn a classifier from the features. All features are invariant to rotation, resulting in a classifier that is invariant to rotation. The presented method does neither rely on the discretisation of 3D space, nor on the extraction of lines, corners or planes. The classifier is extensively evaluated on publicly available outdoor and indoor data, and is shown to be able to robustly and accurately determine whether a pair of point clouds is from the same location or not. Experiments show detection rates of 63% for outdoor and 53% for indoor data at a false alarm rate of 0%. Furthermore, the classifier is shown to generalise well when trained on outdoor data and tested on indoor data in a SLAM experiment.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5651013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5651013","startPage":"2089","endPage":"2095","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05651013.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to close the loop from 3D point clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Learning to close the loop from 3D point clouds","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651013/","accessionNumber":"11689712","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651013/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to close the loop from 3D point clouds","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090686S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5651013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5651072,"authors":[{"name":"Sunil K.

We propose general 2-channel transforms, where output signal is downsampled to guarantee invertibility. We also propose a lifting-based approach, where signals are downsampled before applying the transforms. Our proposed transforms are polynomials of the graph Laplacian matrix and have a simple spectral interpretation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651072.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local two-channel critically sampled filter-banks on graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Laplace equations","Wavelet transforms","Approximation methods","Polynomials","Thigh"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","graph theory","Laplace transforms","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critically sampled filter banks","arbitrary graphs","downsampling method","two-channel transforms","polynomial","graph Laplacian matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-channel filter-banks","multi resolution processing","graph based processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Local two-channel critically sampled filter-banks on graphs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651072/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691138","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local two-channel critically sampled filter-banks on graphs","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053294S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5651088,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Unlike typical transform-coding based methods, the proposed approach does not require any transform to be performed by the imaging sensor when doing on-board compression. Only a small set of pixels on a sparse set of locations on the imaging sensor needs to be captured and transmitted for each image. The decoder side relies on matrix/tensor completion for reconstructing the original images. Hence the scheme can drastically reduce the computation and bandwidth requirements on the on-board imaging sensors. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to obtain compression performance close to JPEG2000 while enjoying the afore-mentioned unique benefits.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Tensile stress","Hyperspectral imaging","Pixel","Transform coding","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image sensors","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-board compression","hyperspectral image compression","tensor completion theory","transform coding","on-board imaging sensor","JPEG2000"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral image compression","matrix completion","tensor completion"]}],"publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651225.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651225","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor completion for on-board compression of hyperspectral images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651225/","displayDocTitle":"Tensor completion for on-board compression of hyperspectral images","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691227","htmlLink":"/document/5651225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor completion for on-board compression of hyperspectral images","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05267S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5651240,"authors":[{"name":"Jesse Lock","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Lock","id":"37544998600"},{"name":"Genevieve Laing","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Genevieve","lastName":"Laing","id":"37586859800"},{"name":"Mohsen Mahvash","affiliation":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Mahvash","id":"37299683500"},{"name":"Pierre E.

As the tubes are rotated and translated with respect to each other, their curvatures interact elastically, enabling control of the robot's tip configuration as well as the curvature along its length. This technology is projected to be useful in many types of minimally invasive medical procedures. Because these robots are flexible by design, they deflect considerably when applying forces to the external environment. Thus, in contrast to rigid-link robots, their kinematic and static force models are coupled. This paper derives a multi-tube quasistatic model that relates tube rotations and translations together with externally applied loads to robot shape and tip configuration. The model can be applied in robot design, procedure planning as well as control. For validation, the multi-tube model is compared experimentally to a computationally-efficient single-tube approximate model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651240/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651240/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11689806","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","pubMedId":"21278853","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quasistatic modeling of concentric tube robots with external loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasistatic modeling of concentric tube robots with external loads","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060511S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5651240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5651241,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37591413300"},{"name":"Bingchen Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292024500"},{"name":"Yueguan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yueguan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598440800"},{"name":"Wen Hong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hong","id":"37290656000"},{"name":"Yirong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yirong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293505200"},{"name":"Jin Zhan","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37587311800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5651241","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"abstract":"Recent theory of compressed sensing (CS) suggested that exact recovery of an unknown sparse signal can be achieved from few measurements with overwhelming probability.

We model a motion as a nonlinear autonomous (i.e. time-invariant) dynamical system, and define the sufficient conditions to make such a system globally asymptotically stable at the target. The convergence of all trajectories is ensured starting from any point in the operational space. We propose a learning method, called Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), that estimates parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model via an optimization problem under non-linear constraints. Being time-invariant and globally stable, the system is able to handle both temporal and spatial perturbations, while performing the motion as close to the demonstrations as possible. The method is evaluated through a set of robotic experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5651259","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05651259.pdf","startPage":"2676","endPage":"2683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5651259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imitation learning of globally stable non-linear point-to-point robot motions using nonlinear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651259/","displayDocTitle":"Imitation learning of globally stable non-linear point-to-point robot motions using nonlinear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689972","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651259/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imitation learning of globally stable non-linear point-to-point robot motions using nonlinear programming","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068131S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5651259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5651263,"authors":[{"name":"Codruta Orniana Ancuti","affiliation":["TUL-IBBT, Expertise Center of Digital Media, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium"],"firstName":"Codruta Orniana","lastName":"Ancuti","id":"37586923500"},{"name":"Cosmin Ancuti","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, University of Politehnica Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Ancuti","id":"37586923600"},{"name":"Philippe Bekaert","affiliation":["TUL-IBBT, Expertise Center of Digital Media, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Bekaert","id":"37321406200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651263","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image color analysis","Helium","Image restoration","Laplace equations","Observers","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","image restoration","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single image dehazing","specific maps","haze-free results","per-pixel fashion","real-time applications","fusion"]}],"abstract":"This papers introduces a new single image dehazing approach.

The method utilizes mean-square-error (MSE) statistics in the frequency domain to detect subcarriers damaged by NBI. Approximating the MSE statistics by a decision-feedback (DF) scheme creates a blind solution without extra pilots or any other training sequences. After simplification, the computation overhead of the proposed DF method can be accomplished by only a multiplier and nine adders. Therefore, this novel method requires low computation complexity and is suitable for hardware implementation. The detection result is beneficial for band-group selection and interference detection and avoidance (DAA) mechanisms for MB-OFDM systems. Simulation results show that conventional spreading methods may fail to combat NBI as the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) decreases.

Moreover, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) which is combined OFDM and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) provides each user with a fraction of the available number of subcarriers. The diversity that exists between users is called multiuser diversity and can be exploited by the sender to enhance the capacity of wireless network. In a multiuser diversity OFDMA, exploiting channel fluctuation diversity is in essence done by selecting the user with the strong subcarrier channels. Therefore, the multiuser diversity techniques promise dramatically increased system throughput and spectral efficiency. In multipath fading environment, severe fading of the signal amplitude and intersymbol interference (ISI) due to the frequency selectivity of the channel cause an unacceptable degradation of error performance. In an OFDM system, ISI is eliminated by inserting guard interval (GI) longer than the delay spread of the channel. On the other hand, this operation is degraded the throughput performance. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput performance for multiuser diversity OFDMA without GI. Previously, we have proposed ISI and inter-carrier interference (ICI) compensation method. In addition, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization can suppress the noise enhancement due to ISI and ICI. Therefore, we employ these methods to eliminate ISI and ICI and try to improve the throughput performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640355/5648820/05651338.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5651338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5651338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput performance enhancement for multiuser diversity OFDMA using MMSE equalization without guard interval","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise","Throughput","Fading","Bit error rate","Neodymium","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","multimedia communication","multipath channels","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","subcarrier multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput performance enhancement","MMSE equalization","high quality multimedia service","wireless communication system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiuser diversity OFDMA","subcarrier channel fluctuation diversity","spectral efficiency","multipath fading","intersymbol interference","frequency selectivity","OFDM system","intercarrier interference compensation method","minimum mean square error equalization","noise enhancement suppression","ISI","ICI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Throughput performance enhancement for multiuser diversity OFDMA using MMSE equalization without guard interval","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732722","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput performance enhancement for multiuser diversity OFDMA using MMSE equalization without guard interval","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"44c41569318927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124386S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640355","isNumber":"5648820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640355","xplore-issue":"5648820","articleId":"5651338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5651339,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yu Sung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuang-Yu","lastName":"Sung","id":"37555295300"},{"name":"Y.-W.

With channel information from the previous symbol period, new pilot locations can be determined so that, on the one hand, channel estimation errors are controlled at a low level and, on the other hand, reliable subcarrier channels are made available for data transmission. The minimum effective SNR across subcarriers is a factor that dominates the symbol-error-rate (SER) at high SNR and, thus, is utilized as the performance measure in this work. First, a lower bound is derived for the achievable SNR gain, which is defined as the ratio between the effective SNR achieved with feedback and that without feedback (i.e., the equal-spaced pilot-placement scheme). The analytic results show that, with a fixed number of subcarriers, the feedback gain will grow as the number of pilot tones increases. Due to the complexity required in finding the optimal solution, a suboptimal but efficient algorithm, called the iterative pilot relocation (IPR) scheme, is proposed, where iterative exchanges between old pilot locations and the location of the worst data subcarrier are done to improve the minimum effective SNR. The efficacy of the proposed IPR scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5651339","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640355/5648820/05651339.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5651339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648820","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-aided pilot placement for amplify-and-forward OFDM relay links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-aided pilot placement for amplify-and-forward OFDM relay links","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651339/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732702","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-aided pilot placement for amplify-and-forward OFDM relay links","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4c41569319075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073609S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640355","isNumber":"5648820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640355","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648820","articleId":"5651339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5651344,"authors":[{"name":"Lennert Jacobs","affiliation":["TELIN Department, DIGCOM Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lennert","lastName":"Jacobs","id":"37410159100"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN Department, DIGCOM Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6015-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6013-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6014-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1943-7439"}],"articleNumber":"5651344","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Rayleigh channels","Receivers","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","error statistics","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","orthogonal codes","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","square OSTBC","imperfect channel estimation","arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading","bit error rate","square orthogonal space-time block code","mismatched maximum-likelihood receiver","channel state information","minimum mean-square error channel estimation","LMMSE channel estimation","signal-to-noise ratio","pulse amplitude modulation","square quadrature amplitude modulation constellation"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we present a novel closed-form approximation of the bit error rate (BER) for square orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) under arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading with imperfect channel estimation.

Motivated by protocol (III) presented in , we propose a distributed space-time coding for an arbitrary number of relay nodes. The pairwise error probability (PEP) is derived and the theory analysis demonstrates that our protocol achieves a diversity of order N +1 where N is the number of relay nodes. Quasi-orthogonal space-time codes are used as they give much better performance than random linear-dispersion codes. As the transmission power of the source node is a critical parameter in this protocol because it transmits in both phases, the optimal power allocation is derived using numerical and theoretical analysis. Simulation results demonstrate an improvement over the existing orthogonal protocols for different source-destination channel conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Resource management","Encoding","Space time codes","Simulation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","linear codes","protocols","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative space-time code","amplify-and-forward relay networks","cooperative protocol","pairwise error probability","transmission power","optimal power allocation","source-destination channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","linear dispersion codes","relay channel","space-time coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5651412","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05651412.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5651412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative space-time code for amplify-and-forward relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative space-time code for amplify-and-forward relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651412/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651412/","accessionNumber":"11688255","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative space-time code for amplify-and-forward relay networks","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042398S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5651412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5651431,"authors":[{"name":"Rolland-Michel Assoumou Nzue","affiliation":["Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation, Le Havre University, Le Havre, France","Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation of Le Havre University (GREAH), FRANCE"],"firstName":"Rolland-Michel","lastName":"Assoumou Nzue","id":"37586423800"},{"name":"Jean Fran\u00e7ois Breth\u00e9","affiliation":["Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation, Le Havre University, Le Havre, France","Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation of Le Havre University (GREAH), FRANCE"],"firstName":"Jean Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Breth\u00e9","id":"37328219900"},{"name":"Eric Vasselin","affiliation":["Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation, Le Havre University, Le Havre, France","Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation of Le Havre University (GREAH), FRANCE"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Vasselin","id":"38505660700"},{"name":"Dimitri Lefebvre","affiliation":["Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation, Le Havre University, Le Havre, France","Group of Research in Electrotechnic and Automation of Le Havre University (GREAH), FRANCE"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Lefebvre","id":"37339972800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5651431","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"abstract":"The paper proposes a new procedure to compare the repeatability of serial and parallel robots based on the stochastic ellipsoid theory. The ISO9283 position repeatability index is estimated but also other performance criteria built upon the stochastic ellipsoid geometrical characteristics. The choice of the best comparison criterion is investigated and different solutions are proposed, associated with the task specificity. For each criterion, maps are built to determine the set of workspace points where the serial robot is better than the parallel robot. The ratio of the workspace surface where one robot is better than the other is computed and the results are analysed. Contrary to the common opinion that parallel robots are more accurate than serial robots, we prove here that the repeatability performance depends mainly on the chosen performance criterion. Another result found is that the considered RRRRR parallel robot keeps the same repeatability in all its workspace.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent

In view of both hydrodynamic problem and engineering approach, we develop a robotic prototype capable of multi-mode motion. A robust gait control for steady swimming using the central pattern generator (CPG) is proposed and has been successfully applied to the robot. The CPG can produce coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity while being simply modulated by control parameters including input drive, frequency, amplitude, threshold, etc., which will be suitable for manually interactive modulation. Using the CPG model, the robot is capable of performing and switching between various locomotion modes such as swimming forwards and backwards, turning and pitching, with the speed, direction and gait types modulated accordingly. A test-bed is provided and results are presented demonstrating interesting properties of the CPG-based control approach and feasibility of the CPG control for efficient propulsion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651475/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689850","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust gait control in biomimetic amphibious robot using central pattern generator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust gait control in biomimetic amphibious robot using central pattern generator","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051744S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5651475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5651477,"authors":[{"name":"Ay\u015fe Demirhan","affiliation":["Teknoloji Fak\u00fcltesi, Gazi \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ay\u015fe","lastName":"Demirhan","id":"37085387673"},{"name":"\u0130nan G\u00fcler","affiliation":["Teknoloji Fak\u00fcltesi, Gazi \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u0130nan","lastName":"G\u00fcler","id":"37327905300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5651477","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Biological neural networks","Wavelet transforms","Pattern recognition","Digital images","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical MRI","brain","cellular biophysics","image reconstruction","image segmentation","neurophysiology","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","brain MR imaging","constitutive tissues","cerebrospinal fluid","multiresolutional wavelet packet transform","self-organizing map networks","T1-weight","T2-weight","PD-weight","subtree method","reconstructed imaging","white matter","gray matter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651477","abstract":"In this study brain MR images are segmented into the constitutive tissues such as the gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using multiresolutional wavelet packet transform and self-organizing map networks.

Although traditional super-resolution techniques have been successful in dealing with image sequences, many constraints such as global translation between frames, have to be imposed to obtain good performance. In this paper, we present a new wavelet-based nonlocal-means (WNLM) framework to bypass the motion estimation stage. It can handle complex motion changes between frames. Compared with the nonlocal-means (NLM) super-resolution framework, the proposed method provides better result in terms of PSNR and faster processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651488","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","startPage":"2817","endPage":"2820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet based nonlocal-means super-resolution for video sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet based nonlocal-means super-resolution for video sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651488/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691394","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet based nonlocal-means super-resolution for video sequences","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5651498,"authors":[{"name":"Huihui Song","affiliation":["Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"Song","id":"37589007700"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"},{"name":"Peikang Wang","affiliation":["Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Peikang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599704100"},{"name":"Kaihua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kaihua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37595716800"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Lane Department of CSEE, West Virginia University, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280864900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651498","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Adaptation model","Laplace equations","Image reconstruction","Strontium","Convergence","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","image representation","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive L1-L2 hybrid error model","super resolution","norm minimization criteria","convergence criterion","representative algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super-resolution","L1 norm","L2 norm","convergence criterion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651498","abstract":"A hybrid error model with L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n norm minimization criteria is proposed in this paper for image/video super-resolution.

Especially moving objects detection and classification by laser scanners mounted on a mobility is required for mobile robots and autonomous cars.

Grid trajectories are obtained by voting sequential laser scan points on a grid map, and these trajectories not only work for a correct scan segmentation, but also represent the size and the speed of moving objects. We classify a moving object into either a person, a group of people, a bike, a car based on its grid trajectory. In our experiments, our mobility mounted laser scanners acquired scan data in the university campus, and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outdoor environments.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5651516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5651516","startPage":"2606","endPage":"2611","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05651516.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving objects detection and classification based on trajectories of LRF scan data on a grid map","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Moving objects detection and classification based on trajectories of LRF scan data on a grid map","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651516/","accessionNumber":"11699445","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651516/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving objects detection and classification based on trajectories of LRF scan data on a grid map","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044091S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5651516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5651522,"authors":[{"name":"Allen Y.

The core processing is based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm which is extended by incorporating color information in the feature vector. The choice of the color space has a large influence on the performance, where we have found that the CIELab and YCbCr color spaces give the best results. The use of color significantly improves the detection performance. We compare the performance of a specific and HOG algorithm, and show that HOG outperforms the specific algorithm by up to tens of percents in most cases. In addition, we propose a new iterative SVM training paradigm to deal with the large variation in background appearance. This reduces memory consumption and increases utilization of background information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color exploitation in hog-based traffic sign detection","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651637","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651637.pdf","startPage":"2669","endPage":"2672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Color exploitation in hog-based traffic sign detection","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651637/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691266","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color exploitation in hog-based traffic sign detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042185S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5651650,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Harmeling","affiliation":["MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Harmeling","id":"37541707900"},{"name":"Suvrit Sra","affiliation":["MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Suvrit","lastName":"Sra","id":"37395015400"},{"name":"Michael Hirsch","affiliation":["MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hirsch","id":"37543623000"},{"name":"Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf","affiliation":["MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sch\u00f6lkopf","id":"37265889200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651650","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"abstract":"We formulate the multiframe blind deconvolution problem in an incremental expectation maximization (EM) framework.

The abundance of data allows us to address both of these without using explicit image or blur priors. The end result is a simple but effective algorithm with no hyperparameters. We apply this algorithm to real-world images from astronomy and to super resolution tasks: for both, our algorithm yields increased resolution and deconvolved images simultaneously.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651650.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3316","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiframe blind deconvolution, super-resolution, and saturation correction via incremental EM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Pixel","Deconvolution","Brightness","Convolution","Image restoration","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","deconvolution","expectation-maximisation algorithm","image denoising","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiframe blind deconvolution","image superresolution","saturation correction","incremental expectation maximization","framework","overexposed pixel","image restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiframe","blind deconvolution","super-resolution","saturation","incremental EM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiframe blind deconvolution, super-resolution, and saturation correction via incremental EM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651650/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691103","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiframe blind deconvolution, super-resolution, and saturation correction via incremental EM","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052304S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5651655,"authors":[{"name":"Gene Cheung","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Japan","National Institute of Informatics"],"firstName":"Gene","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37269486500"},{"name":"Vladan Velisavljevi\u0107","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, Germany"],"firstName":"Vladan","lastName":"Velisavljevi\u0107","id":"37295040500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651655","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"The encoding of both texture and depth maps of a set of multi-view images, captured by a set of spatially correlated cameras, is important for any 3D visual communication systems based on depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among texture and depth maps of multi-view images. We pose the following question: for chosen (1) coding tool to encode texture and depth maps at the encoder and (2) view synthesis tool to reconstruct uncoded views at the decoder, how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among texture and depth maps of selected coded views, such that visual distortion of a \u201cmetric\u201d of reconstructed views is minimized. We show that using the monotonicity assumption, suboptimal solutions can be efficiently pruned from the feasible space during parameter search. Our experiments show that optimal selection of coded views and associated quantization levels for texture and depth maps can outperform a heuristic scheme using constant levels for all maps (commonly used in the standard implementations) by up to 2.0dB. Moreover, the complexity of our scheme can be reduced by up to 66% over full search without loss of optimality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Bit rate","Encoding","Image coding","Optimized production technology","Complexity theory","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image texture","quantisation (signal)","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit allocation","multiview image coding","view synthesis","depth-image-based rendering","3D visual communication systems","coding tool","depth maps","texture maps","visual distortion","associated quantization levels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiview image","bit allocation","monotonicity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651655","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651655.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient bit allocation for multiview image coding & view synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient bit allocation for multiview image coding & view synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651655/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651655/","accessionNumber":"11691397","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient bit allocation for multiview image coding & view synthesis","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048491S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5651659,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Rango","affiliation":["USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Rango","id":"37267067100"},{"name":"Andrea Laliberte","affiliation":["Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Laliberte","id":"37267061800"},{"name":"Kris Havstad","affiliation":["USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Kris","lastName":"Havstad","id":"37586359400"},{"name":"Craig Winters","affiliation":["USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Winters","id":"37603200600"},{"name":"Caiti Steele","affiliation":["Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Caiti","lastName":"Steele","id":"37604695700"},{"name":"Dawn Browning","affiliation":["USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Browning","id":"37601911700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5651659","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","FAA","Monitoring","Photography","Remote sensing","Sensors","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","monitoring","remote sensing","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rangeland resource assessment","rangeland resource monitoring","rangeland resource management","unmanned aerial vehicle","remote sensing","national airspace system","military equivalent agencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle regulations","robotic sensing systems","rangeland applications","photography","cameras"]}],"abstract":"Civilian applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have rapidly been expanding recently.

Since the presence of guard band and multiple access results in leakage, we therefore propose a new approach to reduce leakage on the number of taps which are to be tracked by Kalman Filter.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5651668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05651668.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5651668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage reduction in DFT-based channel estimation for LTE Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Channel estimation","Frequency modulation","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Wireless communication","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Kalman filters","Long Term Evolution","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage reduction","DFT","LTE uplink","OFDM systems","wireless systems","time variation","multipath channel","time domain channel estimation method","guard band","Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Leakage reduction in DFT-based channel estimation for LTE Uplink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651668/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651668/","accessionNumber":"11688271","publicationDate":"April 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage reduction in DFT-based channel estimation for LTE Uplink","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046822S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5651668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5651677,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Lamy","affiliation":["Interactive Robotics Laboratory, CEA LIST, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Lamy","id":"37542510400"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Coll\u00e9dani","affiliation":["CEA LIST, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Coll\u00e9dani","id":"37542511000"},{"name":"Franck Geffard","affiliation":["Interactive Robotics Laboratory, CEA LIST, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Geffard","id":"37444691300"},{"name":"Yvan Measson","affiliation":["Interactive Robotics Laboratory, CEA LIST, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Yvan","lastName":"Measson","id":"37296386500"},{"name":"Guillaume Morel","affiliation":["Institut des Systemes Intelligents et de Robotique (CNRS-FRE 2507), University of Paris 6, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Morel","id":"37274022000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5651677","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Robot sensing systems","Service robots","Humans","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force sensors","industrial manipulators","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human force amplification","industrial robot","dynamic limitations","comanipulation","force sensors","stability-passivity properties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651677","abstract":"In the field of comanipulation (i.e. a man and a robot sharing the same task), force amplification is an interesting function that can be achieved by using two force sensors.

State of the art MTF measurement approaches utilize known targets and work quite well on pixels of size over 2.0 micron. While efforts have been taken towards reliable MTF measurement of smaller pixels, existing methods suffer from high complexities in measurement and analysis. The proposed approach originates from a linear camera model and decomposes the system to linear blocks and sampling operation. The sensor output signal is modeled as a linear combination of intended and unintended signal (noise plus crosstalk). The crosstalk itself is again modeled via a linear kernel that can be obtained based on data from a designed experiment. The sensor MTF is then estimated by combining the relevant elements together. The results are verified against these from a much more sophisticated setup and show good alignment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging sensor Modulation Transfer Function estimation","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651709","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651709.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Imaging sensor Modulation Transfer Function estimation","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651709/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691431","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging sensor Modulation Transfer Function estimation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052362S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5651713,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Kaznov","affiliation":["Rotundus AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Kaznov","id":"37586215100"},{"name":"Mattias Seeman","affiliation":["Rotundus AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mattias","lastName":"Seeman","id":"37301912100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5651713","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":858},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Leg","Vehicles","Robot kinematics","Shape","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outdoor navigation","amphibious robot","mobile robot","spherical morphology","NASA","wheel based rover","Spirit","Groundbot","Rotundus AB","Stockholm","Sweden"]}],"abstract":"Traditionally, mobile robot design is based on wheels, tracks or legs with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

In this paper, we present a novel simple and efficient measurement matrix, Binary Permuted Block Diagonal (BPBD) matrix. The BPBD matrix is binary and highly sparse (all but one or several \u201c1\u201ds in each column are \u201c0\u201ds). Therefore, it can simplify the compressed sensing procedure dramatically. The proposed measurement matrix has the following advantages, which cannot be entirely satisfied by existing measurement matrices. (1) It has easy hardware implementation because of the binary elements; (2) It has high sensing efficiency because of the highly sparse structure; (3) It is incoherent with different popular sparsity basis' like wavelet basis and gradient basis; (4) It provides fast and nearly optimal reconstructions. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed measurement matrix.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651800","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651800.pdf","startPage":"4301","endPage":"4304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The simplest measurement matrix for compressed sensing of natural images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651800/","displayDocTitle":"The simplest measurement matrix for compressed sensing of natural images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691252","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5651800/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The simplest measurement matrix for compressed sensing of natural images","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060092S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5651801,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Akbari","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Akbari","id":"37589064900"},{"name":"Fabrice Labeau","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Labeau","id":"37281330800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651801","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651801","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Equations","Finite impulse response filter","Filter bank","Simulation","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled filter banks","instantaneous erasures","erasure correction","frame-theoretic approach","frame expansion coefficients deletion","frame element"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oversampled Filter Banks","erasure","IIR synthesis filters"]}],"abstract":"Oversampled Filter Banks (OFB) can be used for erasure correction due to the redundancy that they insert into the signal. People have studied erasures using a frame-theoretic approach in which erasure is defined as the deletion of the frame expansion coefficients corresponding to a frame element. This approach applies to OFBs and results in an erasure being interpreted as losing all samples in a sub-band. However, a more realistic and flexible scenario is when an erasure is considered as the loss of sub-band samples only for particular time instances. Alternatively in an erasure-free channel, analogous to the concept of puncturing, the sub-band samples might be erased deliberately to change the code rate. In both of these scenarios, the erasure pattern of sub-bands can differ for different time instances. In this paper, we investigate this situation and derive a set of sufficient conditions that should be satisfied by the OFB in order to reconstruct the output. Simulation results will be presented for substantiating the proposed OFB structure which show the efficiency of this method in increasing the resilience of OFB against erasures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651801","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651801.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampled Filter Banks with instantaneous erasures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Oversampled Filter Banks with instantaneous erasures","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691413","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampled Filter Banks with instantaneous erasures","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052696S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5651824,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Klare","affiliation":["FGAN-Research Institute of High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Klare","id":"37392035600"},{"name":"Olaf Saalmann","affiliation":["FGAN-Research Institute of High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Olaf","lastName":"Saalmann","id":"37298777400"},{"name":"Helmut Wilden","affiliation":["FGAN-Research Institute of High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Wilden","id":"37301010000"},{"name":"Andreas R.

Comparative experiments are carried out to show the leading performance of our new model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651863/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691317","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Poisson noise removal via learned dictionary","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poisson noise removal via learned dictionary","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063089S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5651876,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanwei Jin","affiliation":["Engineering and Aviation Sciences, University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD, USA","Engineering and Aviation Sciences, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD"],"firstName":"Yuanwei","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276324500"},{"name":"Nicholas O'Donoughue","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"O'Donoughue"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

Two sensor parameters, off-axis distance and principle angle, are critical to achieving high quality stereo visualization.

Similar to persons in traveling the robot execute the task into shorter time if has a shorter path. However the trajectory cycle of the robot is strongly related to the displacement in coordinate space rather than operational space. In fact, the shorter distance between two task points is the shorter distance between two configurations. Since robot has different configurations in each task point the minimum trajectory should be chosen between each successive configuration. However the order of visiting the task point also affects the trajectory distance. Moreover the relative robot position to the task also has a trivial effect on the task time.

From each pair of activity video images acquired by a stereo camera, the body joint angles are estimated by co-registering a 3-D body model to the stereo information: our approach uses no attached sensors on the human. The estimated joint angle features from the time-sequential activity video frames are then mapped into codewords to generate a sequence of discrete symbols for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of each activity. With these symbols, each activity HMM is trained and used for activity recognition. The performance of our joint angle-based HAR has been compared to that of the conventional binary silhouette-based HAR, producing significantly better results in the recognition rate: especially for those activities that are not discernible with the conventional approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image

nano-manipulation","abstract":"AFM has been proved to be a powerful nano-manipulation tool taking advantage of its ultra high resolution and precision. However the large spatial uncertainties associated with AFM tip positioning dual to the PZT nonlinearity and thermal drift are still challenging problems, which hinders its wide application especially in building complex structures In this paper, a probabilistic approach combined with the Kalman filter based localization algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of the tip positioning in the task space coordinate frame. A motion model based on the Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model is established, the distribution of model error is statistically obtained through the experimental calibration process. In addition, to further reduce the tip position uncertainties, an environment measurement models is developed through sensing the landmark intermittently with local scanning method during manipulation. Both the simulations results and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/NMDC.2010.5651954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NMDC.2010.5651954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649572","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Nanotechnology Materials and Devices Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638584/5649572/05651954.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Nanotechnology Materials and Devices Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651954","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Position measurement","Probabilistic logic","Uncertainty","Nanobioscience","Accuracy","Motion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","Kalman filters","nanopositioning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AFM tip on-line positioning","nanomanipulation tool","ultra high resolution","spatial uncertainties","PZT nonlinearity","thermal drift","complex structures","Kalman filter","localization algorithm","task space coordinate frame","Prandtl-Ishlinskii model","model error distribution","experimental calibration process","environment measurement models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"AFM tip on-line positioning by using the landmark in nano-manipulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687876","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651954/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651954/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AFM tip on-line positioning by using the landmark in nano-manipulation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050641S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638584","isNumber":"5649572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638584","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5649572","articleId":"5651954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5651958,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599994300"},{"name":"Guijin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guijin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278825900"},{"name":"Wenxin Ning","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenxin","lastName":"Ning","id":"37602101900"},{"name":"Xinggang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinggang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37289263000"},{"name":"Liang Li","affiliation":["Sony China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Li","id":"37600091400"},{"name":"Zhou Liu","affiliation":["Sony China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593000700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5651958","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"abstract":"A novel approach for detecting anomaly in visual surveillance system is proposed in this paper.

In classical image restoration problems, the blur is usually shift invariant and so the convolution operator can be characterized by one single PSF. This assumption allows one to use fast operations such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform a matrix-vector computation efficiently. However, as in most of the video motion deblurring problems, the blur is shift variant and so the matrix-vector multiplication can be difficult to perform. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to construct the convolution matrix explicitly. We exploit the submatrix structure of the convolution matrix and systematically assigning values to the nonzero locations. For small to medium sized images, the convolution matrix gives superior speed than some state-of-art convolution operators.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05651989.pdf","startPage":"3601","endPage":"3604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing a sparse convolution matrix for shift varying image restoration problems","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5651989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Constructing a sparse convolution matrix for shift varying image restoration problems","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691434","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5651989/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing a sparse convolution matrix for shift varying image restoration problems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03212S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5651989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652001,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Demirel","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, KKTC, Do\u011fu Akdeniz \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37338249900"},{"name":"Gholamreza Anbarjafari","affiliation":["Bili\u015fim Sistemleri M\u00fchendisli\u011fi, KKTC, Uluslararasi Kibris \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Anbarjafari","id":"37596451000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5652001","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Wavelet packets","Discrete wavelet transforms","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","singular value decomposition","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex wavelet transform","singular value decomposition","image contrast enhancement","singular value matrix","image reconstruction","inverse CWT","image equalization","general histogram equalization","local histogram equalization","brightness preserving dynamic histogram equalization","singular value equalization"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we have proposed a new image contrast enhancement technique based on complex wavelet transform (CWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD).

The two steps are parameter and data estimation. The second step can be replaced by a recently proposed technique called soft-decision to consider the consistency of image structure during this data estimation. The original idea of both steps is to assume equal variances for all estimation errors, such that an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator can be used. Due to the existence of noise, different object layers, changing in image structures, different spatial distance to the missing data, etc, we observe that the estimation errors of data samples have unequal variances. Hence, a weighted least square (WLS) estimator should be used for both steps. The bilateral filter, which can accurately remove noise and preserve image structure, has been used to model successfully the weights of squared residuals, such that we can apply it to both steps of the estimation. Experimental results show that the average PSNR of this improved interpolation method is 0.47 dB and 0.23 dB higher than two similar approaches, NEDI and Soft-decision Adaptive Interpolation (SAI) using 24 natural images from Kodak.

The classifier is implemented as a single-hidden-layer neural network. Sample results show probability of pixels belonging to fire or smoke. In particular, the classifier successfully distinguishes between smoke and similarly colored white wall, as well as fire from a similarly colored background.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652119","startPage":"761","endPage":"764","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652119.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fire and smoke detection in video with optimal mass transport based optical flow and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Pixel","Artificial neural networks","Optical sensors","Mathematical model","Equations","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","fires","image colour analysis","image sequences","neural nets","object detection","smoke"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fire detection","smoke detection","optimal mass transport","OMT optical flow","supervised Bayesian classification","spatio-temporal neighborhood","feature vector","OMT velocities","RGB color channel","single-hidden-layer neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal Mass Transport","Neural Network","Vision","Video","Detection","Supervised Classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fire and smoke detection in video with optimal mass transport based optical flow and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691489","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fire and smoke detection in video with optimal mass transport based optical flow and neural networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071649S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5652130,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6nder Aydemir","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, KARADEN\u0130Z TEKN\u0130K \u00dcN\u0130VERS\u0130TES\u0130, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00d6nder","lastName":"Aydemir","id":"37890823500"},{"name":"Temel Kayik\u00e7io\u011flu","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, KARADEN\u0130Z TEKN\u0130K \u00dcN\u0130VERS\u0130TES\u0130, Turkey"],"firstName":"Temel","lastName":"Kayik\u00e7io\u011flu","id":"37348225900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5652130","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Electroencephalography","Continuous wavelet transforms","Brain computer interfaces","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet packets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","brain-computer interfaces","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor imagery ECoG signal classification","wavelet transform features","feature vectors","k nearest neighbor method","brain computer interfaces"]}],"abstract":"The input signals of brain computer interfaces may be either electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from scalp or electrocorticogram (ECoG) recorded with subdural electrodes.

The training data that should represent all the background types are generated by the recursive hierarchical segmentation (RHSEG) algorithm and the elimination of the very small segments that may represent anomalies. Experimental results indicate that the LTSA is able to distinguish anomalies from background using a small number of features in the embedded space, and the LTSA-based detector has superior anomaly detection performance to the well-known RX and kernel RX detectors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05652183.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"827","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection for hyperspectral images using local tangent space alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Manifolds","Hyperspectral imaging","Detectors","Image segmentation","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image segmentation","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local tangent space alignment","hyperspectral images","minimum distance detector","out-of-sample extension","recursive hierarchical segmentation algorithm","embedded space","LTSA-based detector","anomaly detection","kernel RX detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral data","anomaly detection","local tangent space alignment (LTSA)","dimensionality reduction (DR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection for hyperspectral images using local tangent space alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11687031","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection for hyperspectral images using local tangent space alignment","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0000824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068838S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5652183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652215,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For this, different technologies are deployed. For example, primary radar is used to detect airplanes during flight approach. Cameras, surface radar, and triangulation systems are deployed for ground surveillance. The ultimate goal of these systems is to improve the efficiency and safety of airport operations. However, airport areas where aircraft are parked, loaded, refueled, and boarded, present a high risk due to the large number of vehicles, goods and people involved in the aircraft handling activity.

This paper addresses a novel feature-based model for visual saliency detection. It consists of two steps: first, using the learned overcomplete sparse bases to represent image patches; and then, estimating saliency information via direct low-rank and sparsity matrix decomposition. We compare our model with the previous methods on natural images. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively for visual saliency detection task, and suggest the potential application of matrix decomposition and convex optimization for image analysis.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Sparse matrices","Visualization","Dictionaries","Humans","Convex functions","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual saliency detection","rank sparsity decomposition","human visual system","object detection","object recognition","feature based model","learned overcomplete sparse base","image patch","saliency information","sparsity matrix decomposition","natural images","convex optimization","image analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["saliency detection","matrix decomposition","sparse coding","convex optimization"]}],"publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652280.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652280","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual saliency detection via rank-sparsity decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652280/","displayDocTitle":"Visual saliency detection via rank-sparsity decomposition","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691530","htmlLink":"/document/5652280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual saliency detection via rank-sparsity decomposition","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064846S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5652283,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An SRC oriented unsupervised MFL algorithm is proposed in this paper and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrated the improvements brought by the proposed MFL algorithm over original SRC.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652363","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652363.pdf","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metaface learning for sparse representation based face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652363/","displayDocTitle":"Metaface learning for sparse representation based face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11691097","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652363/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metaface learning for sparse representation based face recognition","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103795S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652420,"authors":[{"name":"Saloomeh Shariati","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Saloomeh","lastName":"Shariati","id":"37586836000"},{"name":"Laurent Jacques","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Jacques","id":"38579243500"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Standaert","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier","lastName":"Standaert","id":"37300361500"},{"name":"Benoit Macq","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Macq","id":"37276857300"},{"name":"Mohamed Amin Salhi","affiliation":["Institute of Condensed Matter and Nanosciences, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mohamed Amin","lastName":"Salhi","id":"38184725100"},{"name":"Philippe Antoine","affiliation":["Institute of Condensed Matter and Nanosciences, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Antoine","id":"37426909500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5652420","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652420","abstract":"In this paper, we develop an adjustable Fuzzy Extractor using the Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) obtained by a common laser engraving method to sign physical objects. In particular, a string (or helper data) is generated by XORing a binary reduction of the PUF observation with the encoding of a randomly generated key, or identifier. Since the binary reduction (or hash) relies on keeping the sign of few random projections of the observation, a measure concentration property bounds, with a controlled accuracy, the distance between two different hashes in function of this of the original images. The error correcting code used to encode the identifier stabilizes therefore both the observation noise and the hashing distortion. In a verification stage, reobserving the PUF with the helper data in hand allows one to authenticate the object if the identifier can be exactly recovered. We conclude this work by calibrating and challenging the system on a database of laser-written PUFs, balancing helper data size, that is, hashing dimensions, and system security.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652420","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"4329","endPage":"4332","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomly driven fuzzy key extraction of unclonable images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser theory","Measurement by laser beam","Databases","Noise","Error correction codes","Laser modes","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","error correction codes","feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unclonable images","fuzzy key extraction","physical unclonable functions","laser engraving method","XORing","binary reduction","encoding","error correcting code","hash function","PUF","security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy Extractor","Unclonability","Random Projection","Measure Concentration","Hamming Distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Randomly driven fuzzy key extraction of unclonable images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11691207","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5652420/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652420/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomly driven fuzzy key extraction of unclonable images","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114247S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5652443,"authors":[{"name":"Jaegul Choo","affiliation":["School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jaegul","lastName":"Choo","id":"37602784600"},{"name":"Hanseung Lee","affiliation":["Science and Engineering and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Hanseung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599320600"},{"name":"Jaeyeon Kihm","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Jaeyeon","lastName":"Kihm","id":"37592890600"},{"name":"Haesun Park","affiliation":["School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Haesun","lastName":"Park","id":"37277119500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5652443","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Principal component analysis","Space heating","Pixel","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data reduction","data visualisation","face recognition","image classification","interactive systems","pattern clustering","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive visual analytics system","supervised dimension reduction","iVisClassifier","linear discriminant analysis","high dimensional data","associated cluster label","heat map","pairwise distance","cluster centroid","facial image data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.5.2 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces-Theory and methods"]}],"abstract":"We present an interactive visual analytics system for classification, iVisClassifier, based on a supervised dimension reduction method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Instead of a single two- or three-dimensional scatter plot, iVisClassifier fully interacts with all the reduced dimensions obtained by LDA through parallel coordinates and a scatter plot. Furthermore, it significantly improves the interactivity and interpretability of LDA. LDA enables users to understand each of the reduced dimensions and how they influence the data by reconstructing the basis vector into the original data domain. By using heat maps, iVisClassifier gives an overview about the cluster relationship in terms of pairwise distances between cluster centroids both in the original space and in the reduced dimensional space. Equipped with these functionalities, iVisClassifier supports users' classification tasks in an efficient way. Using several facial image data, we show how the above analysis is performed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iVisClassifier: An interactive visual analytics system for classification based on supervised dimension reduction","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638583/5649053/05652443.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"iVisClassifier: An interactive visual analytics system for classification based on supervised dimension reduction","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652443/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694973","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iVisClassifier: An interactive visual analytics system for classification based on supervised dimension reduction","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"027034choo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095825S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638583","isNumber":"5649053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638583","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5649053","articleId":"5652443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652461,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Hanif","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Hanif","id":"37603000500"},{"name":"Atif Bin Mansoor","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Atif Bin","lastName":"Mansoor","id":"37288232500"},{"name":"Tahira Ejaz","affiliation":["National Engineering and Scientific Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Tahira","lastName":"Ejaz","id":"37603740000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5652461","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Positron emission tomography","Transforms","PSNR","Image coding","Phantoms","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","Fourier transforms","health care","image reconstruction","image sampling","medical image processing","patient care","positron emission tomography","single photon emission computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative tomographic image reconstruction","compressive sampling","positron emission tomography","single photon emission computerized tomography","medical imaging","data acquisition","transform domain","radiopharmaceutical doze","patient benefits","health care economics","2D Fourier projections","k-space","2D SPECT/PET projections","nonlinear recovery","structure similarity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sampling","Fourier Projections","Radionuclide Imaging","Convex Optimization"]}],"abstract":"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) are essential medical imaging tools with inherent drawback of slow data acquisition process. With the knowledge that radionuclide images are sparse in transform domain, we have applied a novel concept of Compressive Sampling on them. The proposed approach aims to reconstruct images from fewer measurements, significantly reducing scan time and radiopharmaceutical doze, with benefits for patients and health care economics. The reconstruction of tomographic images is realized by compressed sensing the 2-D Fourier projections. These 2-D projections being sparse in transform domain are sensed with fewer samples in k-space and are reconstructed without loss of fidelity. These undersampled Fourier projections can then be backprojected by employing the iterative reconstruction approach for a complete 3-D volume. Our work focuses on the acquisition of 2-D SPECT/PET projections based on compressive sampling and their reconstruction using a non-linear recovery algorithm. Compressive sampling of a phantom image and PET bone scan scintigraph with radial Fourier samples are performed. The reconstructions of these images are compared to conventionally sampled images with MSE, PSNR and a new image quality measure, Structure SIMilarity (SSIM). The results show high quality image reconstruction using considerably few measurements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652461","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652461.pdf","startPage":"4313","endPage":"4316","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative tomographic image reconstruction by compressive sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative tomographic image reconstruction by compressive sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5652461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690809","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652461/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative tomographic image reconstruction by compressive sampling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048511S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5652463,"authors":[{"name":"Sen Jia","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design, College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Jia","id":"37276798900"},{"name":"Yuntao Qian","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Qian","id":"37276182300"},{"name":"Jiming Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Li","id":"37310379800"},{"name":"Weixiang Liu","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design, College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Weixiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578239100"},{"name":"Zhen Ji","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design, College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Ji","id":"37291525900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5652463","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hyperspectral imaging","Discrete wavelet transforms","Accuracy","Approximation methods","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feature selection","hyperspectral image classification","computation complexity","discrete wavelet transform","affinity propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery classification","dimensionality reduction","discrete wavelet transform","affinity propagation"]}],"abstract":"Due to the enormous amounts of data contained in hyperspectral imagery, the main challenge for hyperspectral image classification is to improve the accuracy with less computation complexity.

Firstly, DWT-based features are extracted from the original hyperspectral data; secondly, AP is applied to select representative features from the obtained ones.

In this paper we present a method to detect these image alterations, using a SIFT-based approach. First we describe a state of the art SIFT-point matching method, which inspired our algorithm, then we compare it with our SIFT-based approach, which consists of three parts: keypoint clustering, cluster matching, and texture analysis. The goal is to find copies of the same object, i.e. clusters of points, rather than points that match. Cluster matching proves to give better results than single point matching, since it returns a complete and coherent comparison between copied objects. At last, textures of matching areas are analyzed and compared to validate results and to eliminate false positives.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652490","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652490.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2120","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting multiple copies in tampered images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Detecting multiple copies in tampered images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5652490/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690784","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652490/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting multiple copies in tampered images","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04526S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5652512,"authors":[{"name":"Jounghoon Beh","affiliation":["UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Jounghoon","lastName":"Beh","id":"37589533000"},{"name":"Taekjin Lee","affiliation":["UBICOD Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taekjin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37595796800"},{"name":"David Han","affiliation":["Naval Research Office, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Han","id":"37588964400"},{"name":"Hanseok Ko","affiliation":["Korea University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanseok","lastName":"Ko","id":"37275585000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5652512","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Arrays","Acoustics","Estimation","Time frequency analysis","Array signal processing","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","human-robot interaction","independent component analysis","least squares approximations","source separation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sound source separation","matched beamforming technique","time-frequency masking technique","residual interference","sequential least squares method","relative transfer function","signal enhanced factor","speech based human-robot interface","independent component analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5652512","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05652512.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5652512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sound source separation by using matched beamforming and time-frequency masking","abstract":"This paper proposes a two-stage algorithm to separate two sound sources by using matched beamforming and time-frequency masking techniques. At first, beamforming was used to separate the sound mixtures back to the original sources while preserving the original contents to the maximum extent. The residual interference was then suppressed by the time-frequency masking technique. A sequential least squares method was used in developing a matched beamformer to estimate the relative transfer function (RTF). From experimental results, it has been shown that the proposed method exhibits improved performance in sound source separation compared to conventional methods. Signal enhanced factor (SEF) was improved by an average of 8.39 dB over the baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652512/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11689225","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652512/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sound source separation by using matched beamforming and time-frequency masking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound source separation by using matched beamforming and time-frequency masking","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073055S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5652512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652553,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew C.

In this paper, we propose an anti-forensic operation capable of removing blocking artifacts from a previously JPEG compressed image. Furthermore, we show that by using this operation along with another anti-forensic operation which we recently proposed, we are able to fool forensic methods designed to detect evidence of JPEG compression in decoded images, determine an image's origin, detect double JPEG compression, and identify cut-and-paste image forgeries.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652553","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2112","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652553.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undetectable image tampering through JPEG compression anti-forensics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Undetectable image tampering through JPEG compression anti-forensics","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652553/","accessionNumber":"11690503","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652553/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undetectable image tampering through JPEG compression anti-forensics","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053269S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5652554,"authors":[{"name":"Ertan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Zonguldak Karaelmas \u00dcniversitesi, Zonguldak, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertan","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"37448403900"},{"name":"Yasin Tun\u00e7kaya","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Zonguldak Karaelmas \u00dcniversitesi, Zonguldak, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yasin","lastName":"Tun\u00e7kaya","id":"38230325600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5652554","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Wireless communication","Lead","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-PSK","M-QAM","OFDM","AWGN channels","Rayleigh fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless networks","modulation technique","symbol error performance","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been used very often in new generation wireless networks.

However reconstruction is often not the ultimate goal and it is of considerable interest to be able to deduce attributes of the signal from the measurements without explicitly reconstructing the full signal. This paper solves the blind source separation problem not in the high dimensional data domain, but in the low dimensional measurement domain. It develops a Bayesian inference framework that integrates hidden Markov models for sources with compressive measurement. Posterior probabilities are calculated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Simulation results are provided for one-dimensional signals and for two-dimensional images, where hidden Markov tree models of the wavelet coefficients are considered. The integrated Bayesian framework is shown to outperform standard approaches where the mixtures are separated in the data domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive blind source separation","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652624","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652624.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressive blind source separation","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652624/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690603","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive blind source separation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047378S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652633,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Herisse","affiliation":["CEA, LIST, Interactive Robotics Laboratory, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Herisse","id":"37546415400"},{"name":"Tarek Hamel","affiliation":["UNSA/CNRS, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Hamel","id":"37299810900"},{"name":"Robert Mahony","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mahony","id":"37283743600"},{"name":"Francois-Xavier Russotto","affiliation":["CEA, LIST, Interactive Robotics Laboratory, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Francois-Xavier","lastName":"Russotto","id":"37546417500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5652633","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":975},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Optical imaging","Vehicle dynamics","Nonlinear optics","Aerodynamics","Optical variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aircraft landing guidance","image sequences","mobile robots","nonlinear control systems","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VTOL unmanned aerial vehicle landing problem","optical flow","nonlinear controller","vertical take-off and landing","textured flat target plane","hovering flight stability","automatic vertical landing regulation","quad-rotor UAV"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a nonlinear controller for hovering flight and landing control on a moving platform for a Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by exploiting the measurement of the average optical flow.

Recently, full-resolution salient maps that retain well-defined boundaries have attracted attention. In these maps, boundaries are preserved by retaining substantially more frequency content from the original image than older techniques. However, if the salient regions comprise more than half the pixels of the image, or if the background is complex, the background gets highlighted instead of the salient object. In this paper, we introduce a method for salient region detection that retains the advantages of such saliency maps while overcoming their shortcomings. Our method exploits features of color and luminance, is simple to implement and is computationally efficient. We compare our algorithm to six state-of-the-art salient region detection methods using publicly available ground truth. Our method outperforms the six algorithms by achieving both higher precision and better recall. We also show application of our saliency maps in an automatic salient object segmentation scheme using graph-cuts.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652636","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency detection using maximum symmetric surround","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saliency detection using maximum symmetric surround","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652636/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690708","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5652636/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency detection using maximum symmetric surround","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057286S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5652643,"authors":[{"name":"V.

There is no blind channel equalization method for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) unknown channel case. In this study, we propose an adaptive blind channel equalization algorithm for MIMO chaotic communication systems. In MIMO communication system, multiuser interference (MUI) is an important factor as well as intersymbol interference (ISI) that hinders receiver performance. To increase receiver performance and achieve reliable, high-speed communication a novel method that overcome the effect of ISI and MUI is developed. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11688151","htmlLink":"/document/5652694/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel equalization of MIMO FIR channels for chaotic communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel equalization of MIMO FIR channels for chaotic communication systems","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046226S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5652694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5652710,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Kuroki","affiliation":["Course of Precision Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Kuroki","id":"37591672500"},{"name":"Kenji Terabayashi","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Terabayashi","id":"37403125300"},{"name":"Kazunori Umeda","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Umeda","id":"37269782700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5652710","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Image sensors","Charge coupled devices","Legged locomotion","Pixel","Measurement by laser beam"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","humanoid robots","image sensors","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact range image sensor","multislit laser projector","obstacle detection","mobile robot","relative disparity map","RDMap","measurement errors","ping-pong ball","LAN cable"]}],"abstract":"Detection of obstacles on a plane is important for a mobile robot that moves in a living space, especially for a humanoid that falls down even with a small obstacle. In this paper, a range image sensor for detecting small obstacles on a plane is constructed using a multi-slit laser projector. The sensor consists of a commercially available laser projector and a CCD camera. It measures a relative disparity map (RDMap) whose measurement errors are not affected by the distance. From the obtained RDMap, a plane is estimated using RANSAC and regions out of the plane are detected as obstacles. Experiments show that planes can be obtained with small errors in RDMaps with the constructed sensor, and that a humanoid with the constructed sensor can detect small obstacles such as a moving ping-pong ball and a LAN cable on a plane by the proposed methods while walking.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5652710","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05652710.pdf","startPage":"5972","endPage":"5977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5652710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of a compact range image sensor using multi-slit laser projector and obstacle detection of a humanoid with the sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652710/","displayDocTitle":"Construction of a compact range image sensor using multi-slit laser projector and obstacle detection of a humanoid with the sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689185","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652710/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of a compact range image sensor using multi-slit laser projector and obstacle detection of a humanoid with the sensor","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061527S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5652710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5652718,"authors":[{"name":"Shutao Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shutao","lastName":"Li","id":"37279618700"},{"name":"Leyuan Fang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Leyuan","lastName":"Fang","id":"37591994500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5652718","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Noise reduction","Joints","Image denoising","Training","Approximation algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","quadtrees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learned dictionary","nonlocal denoising","sparse representation","quad-tree structure","sparse dictionary model","3D operation","PSNR","visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse representation","Dictionary learning","Non-local denoising","K-SVD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652718","abstract":"This paper proposes a new learned dictionary for sparse representation of given data and suggests a way to apply it to non-local denoising.

This 3-D operation is achieved by a simple concatenation of the similar patches to a single vector and training the proposed dictionary on it.

Each low-speed frame integrates a coded sequence of high-speed frames during its exposure time. The high-speed video can be reconstructed from the low-speed coded frames using a sparse recovery algorithm. This paper presents a new streaming CS algorithm specifically tailored to this application. Our streaming approach allows causal on-line acquisition and reconstruction of the video, with a small, controllable, and guaranteed buffer delay and low computational cost. The algorithm adapts to changes in the signal structure and, thus, outperforms the off-line algorithm in realistic signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652725.pdf","startPage":"3373","endPage":"3376","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streaming Compressive Sensing for high-speed periodic videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Pixel","Image reconstruction","Computational modeling","Sensors","Reconstruction algorithms","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["streaming compressive sensing","high speed periodic video","sparse signal","computational imaging","near-periodic video","intensive off-line processing","coded sequence","high-speed frame","sparse recovery algorithm","online acquisition","video reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Streaming Compressive Sensing for high-speed periodic videos","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652725/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690396","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streaming Compressive Sensing for high-speed periodic videos","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069225S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652726,"authors":[{"name":"Thong T.

Quantization in video compression can be regarded as a subsampling process where the signal is mapped into predefined levels. We view the problem of signal reconstruction from its quantized signal vector as a compressive sensing recovery problem where the quantized coefficients are subsampled measurements. Based on this observation, we propose a novel method of image/video coding that employs an adaptive Total-Variation (TV) minimization in the pixel domain to recover the gradient-sparse image blocks from their quantized transform coefficients. We further increase the coding efficiency by encoding only a subset of the transform coefficients and discard the remaining ones. Experiment results show that the proposed framework is efficient with gradient-sparse video signals and outperform the video compression standard H.264/AVC by up to 7% of bitrate reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652726.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3380","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing with adaptive pixel domain reconstruction for block-based video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Encoding","Quantization","Sensors","Image reconstruction","Pixel","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","minimisation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","adaptive pixel domain reconstruction","block-based video coding","quantization","subsampling process","adaptive total-variation minimization","bitrate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","compressive sensing","nonlinear reconstruction","Total-Variation minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing with adaptive pixel domain reconstruction for block-based video coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690424","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing with adaptive pixel domain reconstruction for block-based video coding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046011S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5652744,"authors":[{"name":"Yookyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yookyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406991800"},{"name":"Mariappan S.

Early CS recovery techniques operated under the implicit assumption that the transform coefficients in the sparsity domain are independently distributed.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM) model in CS. This model can efficiently exploit the statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients during CS recovery.

MCSB-ICA is an integrated method of sound source separation that accomplishes blind source separation, blind dereverberation, and echo cancellation. This method enables robots to separate user's speech signals from observed signals including the robot's own speech, other speech and their reverberations without a priori information. The main problem when MCSB-ICA is applied to robot audition is its high computational cost. We tackle this by multi-threading programming, and the two main issues are 1) the design of parallel processing and 2) incremental implementation. These are solved by a) multiple-stack-based parallel implementation, and b) resampling-based overlaps and block-wise separation. The experimental results proved that our method reduced the real-time factor to less than 0.5 with an eight-core CPU, and it improves the performance of automatic speech recognition by 2-10 points compared with the single-stack-based parallel implementation without the resampling technique.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5652757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5652757","startPage":"1949","endPage":"1956","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05652757.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speedup and performance improvement of ICA-based robot audition by parallel and resampling-based block-wise processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Speedup and performance improvement of ICA-based robot audition by parallel and resampling-based block-wise processing","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652757/","accessionNumber":"11689214","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652757/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speedup and performance improvement of ICA-based robot audition by parallel and resampling-based block-wise processing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051926S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5652757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5652767,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Trocan","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Electronique de Paris, France"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Trocan","id":"37563648600"},{"name":"Thomas Maugey","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Maugey","id":"37395074500"},{"name":"Eric W.

Finally, we investigate the reasons for this improved performance.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5652808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5652808","startPage":"519","endPage":"522","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05652808.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the iterative decoding of LDPC convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652808/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the iterative decoding of LDPC convolutional codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11688153","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5652808/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the iterative decoding of LDPC convolutional codes","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046242S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5652808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5652810,"authors":[{"name":"D.-O Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"D.-O","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309989600"},{"name":"R.-H.

In general, an arbitrary image is not sparse or compressible, however, its derivative image is compressible. In this paper, derivative images are obtained using first- and second-order derivative filters such as Sobel operators and Laplacian of Gaussian filters. Each derivative image of the reference and distorted images is measured via CS. Measurements of derivative images are compared for evaluating the image quality. Experiments with the laboratory for image and video engineering database show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652810.pdf","startPage":"3357","endPage":"3360","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New image quality metric using derivative filters and compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Distortion measurement","Image coding","Visualization","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image quality metric","derivative filters","compressive sensing","sparse signal","derivative image","Sobel operators","Laplacian of Gaussian filters","distorted images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Derivative filter","DMOS","Image quality assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"New image quality metric using derivative filters and compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690507","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New image quality metric using derivative filters and compressive sensing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106099S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5652879,"authors":[{"name":"Narges Mahyar","affiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Narges","lastName":"Mahyar","id":"37591344800"},{"name":"Ali Sarvghad","affiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sarvghad","id":"37591344300"},{"name":"Melanie Tory","affiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Melanie","lastName":"Tory","id":"37275861300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5652879","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Software","Marketing and sales","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","data analysis","data visualisation","interactive devices","recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["note taking","co-located collaborative visual analytics process","record keeping","collaborative data analysis","tabletop display","large interactive wall","analysis process","collaborative visual analytic tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["note taking","recording","collaboration","tabletop","wall display","history","provenance"]}],"abstract":"This paper highlights the important role that record-keeping (i.e. taking notes and saving charts) plays in collaborative data analysis within the business domain.

Part of our findings is a collaborative data analysis framework that encompasses note taking as one of the main activities. We observed that record-keeping was a critical activity within the analysis process. Based on our observations, we characterize notes according to their content, scope, and usage, and describe how they fit into a process of collaborative data analysis.

For large-scale events such as televised debates and speeches, the amount of content on social media can easily become overwhelming, yet still contain information that may aid and augment reporting via individual content items as well as via aggregate information from the crowd's response. In this work we present a visual analytic tool, Vox Civitas, designed to help journalists and media professionals extract news value from large-scale aggregations of social media content around broadcast events. We discuss the design of the tool, present the text analysis techniques used to enable the presentation, and provide details on the visual and interaction design.

However, it is still very challenging to design effective visual metaphors to represent large corpora of text due to the unstructured and high-dimensional nature of text. In this paper, we propose a data model that can be used to represent most of the text corpora. Such a data model contains four basic types of facets: time, category, content (unstructured), and structured facet. To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds. We encode the four types of data facets with four separate visual dimensions. To help people discover evolutionary and correlation patterns, we also develop several visual interaction methods that allow people to interactively analyze text by one or more facets. Finally, we present two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in support of multi-faceted visual analysis of text

The scheme uses the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), which assumes that the nodes negotiate, with the help of a centralized control unit, on how to allocate resources. The NBS takes into account the video quality each node could achieve without making an agreement. The cross-layer optimization scheme determines the source coding rate, channel coding rate, and transmission power for each node. We compare the proposed game-theory-based scheme with competing schemes that minimize the average or maximum distortion among the nodes. Experimental results are presented and conclusions are drawn.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GAME-theory-based cross-layer optimization for wireless DS-CDMA visual sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652947","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05652947.pdf","startPage":"4485","endPage":"4488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"GAME-theory-based cross-layer optimization for wireless DS-CDMA visual sensor networks","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652947/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GAME-theory-based cross-layer optimization for wireless DS-CDMA visual sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048872S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5652947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5652953,"authors":[{"name":"Seiji Aoyagi","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiji","lastName":"Aoyagi","id":"37390760000"},{"name":"Atsushi Kohama","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Kohama","id":"37591161900"},{"name":"Yasutaka Nakata","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutaka","lastName":"Nakata","id":"37593799200"},{"name":"Yuki Hayano","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Hayano","id":"37585871500"},{"name":"Masato Suzuki","affiliation":["Department Mechanical Engineering, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37400874100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5652953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":948},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Artificial neural networks","Joints","Kinematics","Measurement by laser beam","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","dexterous manipulators","genetic algorithms","industrial manipulators","manipulator kinematics","neural nets","optical tracking","position measurement","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot kinematics","laser tracking system","nongeometric error compensation","neural networks","genetic algorithm","robot arm tip measurement","calibration","optimal measuring point"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5652953","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05652953.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","startPage":"5660","endPage":"5665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5652953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of robot accuracy by calibrating kinematic model using a laser tracking system-compensation of non-geometric errors using neural networks and selection of optimal measuring points using genetic algorithm-","abstract":"A laser tracking system is employed for measuring robot arm's tip with high accuracy. Geometric parameters in a robot kinematic model are calibrated by minimizing errors between measured positions and predicted ones based on the model. Residual errors caused by non-geometric parameters are further reduced by using neural networks, realizing high positioning accuracy of sub-millimeter order.

However, in many cases it is difficult to produce a single georeferenced mosaic from the many small images taken from the UAV. This is due to the lack of features in the images and the inherent errors from the inexpensive navigation sensors. This paper focuses on improving the orthorectification accuracy by finding these errors and calibrating the navigation sensors. This is done by inverse-orthorectifying a set of images collected during flight using ground targets and General Procrustes Analysis. By comparing the calculated data from the inverse-orthorectification and the measured data from the navigation sensors, different sources of errors can be found and characterized, such as GPS computational delay, logging delay, and biases. With this method, the orthorectification errors are reduced from less than 60m to less than 1.5m.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5652989/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5652989/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11686321","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"In-situ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensor calibration to improve automatic image orthorectification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-situ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensor calibration to improve automatic image orthorectification","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0000596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05107S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5652989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653050,"authors":[{"name":"Yueguan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yueguan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598440800"},{"name":"Bingchen Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292024500"},{"name":"Wen Hong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hong","id":"37290656000"},{"name":"Yirong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yirong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293505200"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37292397200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5653050","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","MIMO","Imaging","Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","MIMO radar","radar imaging","signal sampling","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO SAR processing","ambiguity suppression","multiple-input multiple-output","SAR azimuth nonuniform samplings","azimuth spectrum reconstruction","minimum mean square error","MMSE imaging","nonideal orthogonality","multichannel encoding waveforms","SAR imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO SAR","Multi-channel encoding waveforms","Azimuth spectrum reconstruction","MMSE imaging"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyses ambiguity suppression caused by multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SAR azimuth nonuniform samplings.

The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it can fully utilize LBP information while it does not need any training step, which may be sensitive to training samples. Experiments on one public face database and one palmprint database show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653119","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05653119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","startPage":"4521","endPage":"4524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical multiscale LBP for face and palmprint recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical multiscale LBP for face and palmprint recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653119/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690392","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical multiscale LBP for face and palmprint recognition","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047757S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5653164,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmut Yal\u00e7\u0131n","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mahmut","lastName":"Yal\u00e7\u0131n","id":"37395324000"},{"name":"Ayd\u0131n Akan","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayd\u0131n","lastName":"Akan","id":"37327893100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5653164","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Fading","Doppler effect","Interpolation","Fast Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","interpolation","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM channel estimation","interpolation technique","receiver","fading channel","subchannel orthogonality","ICI","pilot symbol assisted channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Receivers used conventional estimation methods assume a timeinvariant for the channel during one OFDM symbol, but in fading channels with very high mobility, the time variation of channel over an OFDM symbol results in a loss of subchannel orthogonality which leads to ICI.

However, the required and sophisticated time of arrival (ToA) ranging procedure relies on accurate synchronization and time measurements. Today, only few UWB devices support the required ranging feature. Examples are pulse based low data rate (LDR) UWB devices. Conventional multiband OFDM based high data rate (HDR) UWB devices do not support the ToA ranging feature. But the ultra wide frequency bandwidth of UWB enables not only high resolution of space surrounding UWB transceivers and therefore accurate time measurements, its enormous frequency diversity also minimizes fading effects. This allows reliable distance measurements, based on measurements of the received signal strength (RSS). This paper shows, that RSS based localization can be as accurate as ToA based localization. For this purpose, measurement results of the RSS and a derived path-loss model are used to calibrate a Monte Carlo simulator for RSS based ranging and localization. The RSS measurements are done with conventional wireless USB sticks, using HDR UWB. For a small 2 \u00d7 2 meters network, the simulation results show mean localization errors between 0.1 and 0.2 meters.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2010.5653193","publicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647780/5649084/05653193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2010.5653193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649084","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positioning in multiband OFDM UWB utilizing received signal strength","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Positioning in multiband OFDM UWB utilizing received signal strength","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653193/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11688449","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positioning in multiband OFDM UWB utilizing received signal strength","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084547S","chronDate":"11-12 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647780","isNumber":"5649084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647780","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5649084","articleId":"5653193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5653254,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher K.

In many applications, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), uniform measurements are undesirable or impractical. Non-equispaced measurements in the Fourier domain are typically obtained through methods that use FFT values to interpolate the DTFT at off-grid locations. These algorithms, known as NUFFTs, are prohibitively expensive for large data sets in 3-D because of the interpolation cost. This paper proposes an exact transform called the SpiralFFT capable of sampling the DTFT on spiral patterns in 3-D frequency space. The SpiralFFT uses spiral structure to replace 3-D calculations with 1-D FFTs and chirp Z-transforms (CZTs). Simulations compare the SpiralFFT with a NUFFT algorithm on a realistic 3-D MRI data set. Results show that the SpiralFFT exhibits a factor of 8 increase in speed for comparable accuracy, and 8 orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy for comparable execution time. These results demonstrate the potential use of the SpiralFFT in spiral MRI to improve reconstruction speed and quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05653254.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"620","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiral FFT: An efficient method for 3-D FFTS on spiral MRI contours","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Magnetic resonance imaging","Interpolation","Accuracy","Discrete Fourier transforms","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","discrete Fourier transforms","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiral FFT","3D FFTS","spiral MRI contour","fast Fourier transform","discrete time Fourier transform","DTFT","magnetic resonance imaging","chirp Z-transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Discrete Fourier transforms","chirp z-transform","sampling methods","unequispaced FFT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spiral FFT: An efficient method for 3-D FFTS on spiral MRI contours","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690726","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiral FFT: An efficient method for 3-D FFTS on spiral MRI contours","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055319S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5653257,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Bonnal","affiliation":["CNRS; LAAS, Toulouse, France","UPS, INSA, INP, ISAE, LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Bonnal","id":"37586855300"},{"name":"Patrick Dan\u00e8s","affiliation":["CNRS; LAAS, Toulouse, France","UPS, INSA, INP, ISAE, LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Dan\u00e8s","id":"37300892800"},{"name":"Marc Renaud","affiliation":["CNRS; LAAS, Toulouse, France","UPS, INSA, INP, ISAE, LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Renaud","id":"37089135889"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5653257","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of acoustic patterns by stochastic Matched Filtering","abstract":"The detection of a pattern in an audio sequence is considered.

This capability is critical for future applications in automation and service robotics where humans will work closely with robots to jointly perform tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11689124","htmlLink":"/document/5653275/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Real-time path planning for a robot arm in changing environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time path planning for a robot arm in changing environments","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053142S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5653275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5653307,"authors":[{"name":"Ippeita Izawa","affiliation":["Department of Electric Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ippeita","lastName":"Izawa","id":"37595203900"},{"name":"Takayuki Hamamoto","affiliation":["Department of Electric Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Hamamoto","id":"37285218100"},{"name":"Kazuya Kodama","affiliation":["Research Organization of Information and Systems, National Institute of Information, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Kodama","id":"37301390000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5653307","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653307","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Pixel","Field programmable gate arrays","SDRAM","Imaging","Iris","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","signal processing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality free viewpoint image reconstruction systems","multifocus images","FPGA-based signal processing","multifocus imaging sequences","depth estimation","BlockRAM","FPGA-based free viewpoint image reconstruction systems","onboard DDR SDRAM","synthetic images","picture size 64 pixel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image restoration","Field programmable gate arrays","Real time systems"]}],"abstract":"We previously proposed a method of generating free viewpoint images directly from multi-focus imaging sequences without any depth estimation.

It is based on a proposed dual-parallel connected component labeling method. The main idea is to break the sequentiality of the labeling procedure by separating image into slices and to correctly delimit the extent of all connected components locally, on each slice, simultaneously. According to the proposed method, a scalable architecture which can be adaptive to different throughput requirement is derived. The proposed architecture consists of local label assignment, local label fusion, and global process unit. The forest structure is introduced to cope with both global and local label equivalent. Based on the forest structure, find and union operations are implemented to complete the entire connected components labeling during two raster scans. Performance of the proposed architecture estimated in terms of the number of clocks and memory requirement are brought forward to justify the superiority of the novel design compared against previous implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable parallel hardware architecture for connected component labeling","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653457","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05653457.pdf","startPage":"3753","endPage":"3756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A scalable parallel hardware architecture for connected component labeling","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653457/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690545","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable parallel hardware architecture for connected component labeling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0003753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044337S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5653469,"authors":[{"name":"Miaohui Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Miaohui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37600456800"},{"name":"Bo Yan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yan","id":"37589692500"},{"name":"Hamid Gharavi","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Gharavi","id":"37269469600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5653469","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Pixel","Mathematical model","Shape","Equations","Painting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pyramid model","image inpainting","damaged pictures","down-sampling inpainting model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image inpainting","Pyramid model","Down-sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653469","abstract":"Image inpainting is a useful and powerful technique for automatically restoring or removing objects in films and damaged pictures.

Addition, obtained results were shown with figures and were compared with Kaiser window results and finally, it was observed that the improved method for some applications has more useful structure.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5653480","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05653480.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"478","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5653480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of uniform scattered Genetic Algorithms to window function performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"The effect of uniform scattered Genetic Algorithms to window function performance","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11688135","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653480/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of uniform scattered Genetic Algorithms to window function performance","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049761S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5653480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5653508,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Rehman","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Rehman","id":"37718604600"},{"name":"Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291903900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5653508","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion measurement","Feature extraction","Estimation","Image quality","Transforms","Nonlinear distortion","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSIM estimation","structural similarity index","perceptual image quality predictor","reduced-reference approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reduced-reference image quality assessment","structural similarity","natural image statistics","divisive normalization transform","regression by discretization","image repairing"]}],"abstract":"The structural similarity (SSIM) index has been shown to be a good perceptual image quality predictor. In many real-world applications such as network visual communications, however, SSIM is not applicable because its computation requires full access to the original image. Here we propose a reduced-reference approach that estimates SSIM with only partial information about the original image. Specifically, we extract statistical features from a multi-scale, multi-orientation divisive normalization transform and develop a distortion measure by following the philosophy analogous to that in the construction of SSIM. We found an interesting linear relationship between our reduced-reference SSIM estimate and full-reference SSIM when the image distortion type is fixed. A regression-by-discretization method is then applied to normalize our measure between image distortion types. We use the LIVE database to test the proposed distortion measure, which shows strong correlations with both SSIM and subjective evaluations. We also demonstrate how our reduced-reference features may be employed to partially repair a distorted image.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05653508.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-reference SSIM estimation","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-reference SSIM estimation","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690429","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653508/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-reference SSIM estimation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042933S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653510,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Gabriel Bozomitu","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu Gabriel","lastName":"Bozomitu","id":"37396381200"},{"name":"Vlad Cehan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Cehan","id":"37396377300"},{"name":"Constantin Baraba\u015fa","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Baraba\u015fa","id":"37396379300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8124-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8123-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8122-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5653510","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Frequency synthesizers","Phase locked loops","Frequency conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","Equations","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","frequency synthesizers","phase locked loops","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","CMOS frequency synthesizer","SRD applications","short range devices","frequency divider circuit","fast acquisition PLL","frequency 850 MHz to 950 MHz","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency synthesizer","PLL","CMOS","SRD","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new VLSI implementation of a CMOS frequency synthesizer for short range devices (SRD) applications is presented.

POLSAR data are a type of mass data and have more independent features which can represent different physical significances than optical image. Therefore, POLSAR image classification is actually a high dimensional nonlinear mapping problem. Because of the nonlinear mapping function of BP neural network, it can be used to classify POLSAR image. But BP neural network classifier is sensitive to initial weights and thresholds. Quantum Clonal Evolutionary Algorithm (QCEA) can converge to an optimal value quickly and can be used to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of BP neural network. Therefore, in this paper, BP classifier based on QCEA was used for POLSAR image classification. Firstly, optimize the initial weights and thresholds of BP neural network using QCEA. Secondly, train the optimized BP neural network classifier by gradient descent algorithm. Finally, classify the POLSAR image using the trained classifier. The validity test is demonstrated using Danish EMISAR L-band fully polarimetric data of Foulum Area (DK), Denmark. The preliminary result indicates that this method can classify most of the areas correctly.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653650","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1576","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05653650.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POLSAR image classification using BP neural network based on Quantum Clonal Evolutionary Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653650/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"POLSAR image classification using BP neural network based on Quantum Clonal Evolutionary Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653650/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11686084","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POLSAR image classification using BP neural network based on Quantum Clonal Evolutionary Algorithm","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0001573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049745S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5653650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":5653653,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405970500"},{"name":"Konstantinos N.

As high resolution cameras provide a huge amount of image data and the bandwidth of a wireless network connection is strongly limited, we are using intelligent camera systems on the mobile robot platform to execute parts of the image processing functions directly on the robot. This way only preprocessed image information will be transmitted instead of raw image data.

Most indoor environments have many different features (ferrous structural materials or contents, electrical currents, etc.) which perturb the Earths natural magnetic field. The variations in the magnetic field in indoor environments can be used as a way to identify a users position, and possibly orientation, because the 3-dimensional magnetic field varies significantly as a function of position. Using relatively inexpensive 3-axis magnetic field sensors, it is possible to estimate a users location in an indoor environment. This paper presents algorithms and results from two different scenarios, based on a real data map-matching scenario, and a leader-follower scenario. In the map matching scenario, it is assumed that a map of the magnetic field in the indoor environment has been previously collected. Magnetic field measurements are then compared to the previously generated map to get an absolute position. Results using real data showed very good (decimeter-level) positioning performance. For the leader-follower scenario, the lead vehicle moves through the environment, measures the magnetic field, and sends information about what it has observed to the follower vehicle, which attempts to follow the same path as the lead vehicle. Results show that it is possible for a follower vehicle to follow a lead vehicle using this approach, especially if additional constraints (such as wall boundaries) can be applied to further constrain the trajectory. Finally, this paper describes some practical calibration issues that must be considered when implementing a magnetic field navigation system.","doi":"10.1109/UPINLBS.2010.5653681","publicationTitle":"2010 Ubiquitous Positioning Indoor Navigation and Location Based Service","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Ubiquitous Positioning Indoor Navigation and Location Based Service","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640100/5648783/05653681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPINLBS.2010.5653681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648783","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic field navigation in an indoor environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic field navigation in an indoor environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653681/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678198","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653681/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic field navigation in an indoor environment","confLoc":"Kirkkonummi, Finland","sourcePdf":"S71OStormsEtALMagneticFieldNavigationinanIndoorEnv.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053761S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640100","isNumber":"5648783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640100","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5648783","articleId":"5653681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653690,"authors":[{"name":"Ningning Jia","affiliation":["Imaging Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ningning","lastName":"Jia","id":"37602157300"},{"name":"Edmund Y.

Inverse lithography synthesizes an optimal mask by treating the design as an image synthesis inverse problem. To date, much effort is dedicated to solving it for some nominal process conditions. However, the small feature size also suggests that the effect of process variations is more pronounced. In this paper, we design a mask that is robust against focus variations within the inverse lithography framework. Each iteration involves more computation than a similar method designed for the nominal conditions, but we simplify the task by using stochastic gradient descent, which is a technique from machine learning. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm is effective in producing robust masks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690550","htmlLink":"/document/5653690/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stochastic gradient descent for robust inverse photomask synthesis in optical lithography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic gradient descent for robust inverse photomask synthesis in optical lithography","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0004173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050263S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653703,"authors":[{"name":"Mohit Pathak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohit","lastName":"Pathak","id":"37281793300"},{"name":"Young-Joon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Young-Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539806600"},{"name":"Thomas Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Moon","id":"37588326700"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5653703","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":587},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653703","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Through-silicon vias","Routing","Logic gates","Timing","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","integrated circuit design","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through-silicon-via management","3D physical design","3D integrated circuit","TSV management","TSV insertion","physical design flow","TSV placement methodology","GDSII layout"]}],"abstract":"In 3D integrated circuits through silicon vias (TSVs) are used to connect different dies stacked on top of each other. These TSV occupy silicon area and have significantly larger area than regular gates. In this paper, we address two critical aspects of TSV management in 3D designs. First, we address the problem of how many TSVs to add in a design. Since TSVs occupy significant silicon area, a general tendency has been to use a minimum number of TSVs in 3D circuits. We show that such an approach does not give us the best possible result. Second, we address the problem of TSV insertion. Because TSVs occupy silicon area, their location is decided during the placement stage of 3D design. However, we show that this is not the best possible stage for TSV insertion.

These devices enable the electrical manipulation of microfluidics with various advantages such as low power consumption, flexibility, accuracy, and efficiency. In addressing the need for low-cost and practical fabrication, pin-count reduction has become a key problem to the large-scale integration of EWOD-chip designs. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually compatible control signals. Most previous studies utilize this addressing scheme by scheduling fluidic-level synthesis on pin-constrained chip arrays. However, the associated interconnect routing problem is still not provided in currently available DMF automations, and thus the broadcast-addressing scheme cannot be actually realized. In this paper, we present the first network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for EWOD-chip designs with a broadcast electrode-addressing scheme. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and wirelength minimization into consideration for higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm on a set of real-life chip applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653715","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","startPage":"425","endPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for broadcast electrode-addressing EWOD chips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for broadcast electrode-addressing EWOD chips","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687885","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for broadcast electrode-addressing EWOD chips","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07006A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10896S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5653720,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Sun","affiliation":["6 MetroTech Center, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37538784800"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["6 MetroTech Center, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Shakopee, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5653720","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":466},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variation tolerant sensing scheme of Spin-Transfer Torque Memory for yield improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Sensors","Random access memory","Transistors","Monte Carlo methods","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit yield","magnetic tunnelling","Monte Carlo methods","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variation tolerant sensing scheme","spin-transfer torque random access memory","yield improvement","universal memory","access speed","zero standby power","cell structure","magnetic tunneling junction","CMOS process","STT-RAM chip","process variation","voltage-driven nondestructive self-reference sensing scheme","sense margin","Monte-Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STT-RAM","process variations","yield"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653720","abstract":"Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) demonstrated great potentials as an universal memory for its fast access speed, zero standby power, excellent scalability and simplicity of cell structure.

In this paper, we propose novel techniques based on binary linear programming for clock mesh synthesis for the first time in the literature. The proposed approach can explore both regular and irregular mesh configurations, adapting to non-uniform load capacitance distribution. Our synthesis consists of two steps: mesh construction to minimize total capacitance and skew, and balanced sink assignment to improve slew/skew characteristics. We first show that mesh construction can be analytically formulated as binary polynomial programming (a class of nonlinear discrete optimization), then apply a compact linearization technique to transform into binary linear programming, significantly reducing computational overhead. Second, our balanced sink assignment enables a sink to tap the least loaded mesh segment (not the nearest one) with another binary linear programming which reduces both slew and skew. Experiments show that our techniques improve the worst skew and total capacitance by 14% and 15% over the state-of-the-art clock mesh algorithm on ISPD09 benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653737","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel binary linear programming for high performance clock mesh synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel binary linear programming for high performance clock mesh synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678647","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel binary linear programming for high performance clock mesh synthesis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07206B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088857S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653738,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Jin Lee","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406583200"},{"name":"Myung-Chul Kim","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, US"],"firstName":"Myung-Chul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37597329100"},{"name":"Igor L.

Our implementation, Contango 2.0, outperforms the winners of the ISPD 2010 clock-network synthesis contest on 45nm benchmarks from Intel and IBM.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653738","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","startPage":"444","endPage":"451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power clock trees for CPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-power clock trees for CPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653738/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678644","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653738/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power clock trees for CPUs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07306B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146992S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653749,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Sridhar","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Sridhar","id":"37391030400"},{"name":"Alessandro Vincenzi","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Vincenzi","id":"37593968800"},{"name":"Martino Ruggiero","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martino","lastName":"Ruggiero","id":"37392165600"},{"name":"Thomas Brunschwiler","affiliation":["Advanced Thermal Packaging Group, IBM Research Laboratory, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brunschwiler","id":"37265770000"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5653749","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":194,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1893},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Microchannel","Heating","Three dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","integrated circuit design","thermal management (packaging)","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D-ICE","compact transient thermal modeling","3D IC","intertier liquid cooling","three dimensional stacked integrated circuits","intertier integrated microchannel cooling","heat flux removal","thermal management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact modeling","microchannel","3D IC","inter-tier cooling"]}],"abstract":"Three dimensional stacked integrated circuits (3D ICs) are extremely attractive for overcoming the barriers in interconnect scaling, offering an opportunity to continue the CMOS performance trends for the next decade. However, from a thermal perspective, vertical integration of high-performance ICs in the form of 3D stacks is highly demanding since the effective areal heat dissipation increases with number of dies (with hotspot heat fluxes up to 250 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) generating high chip temperatures. In this context, inter-tier integrated microchannel cooling is a promising and scalable solution for high heat flux removal. A robust design of a 3D IC and its subsequent thermal management depend heavily upon accurate modeling of the effects of liquid cooling on the thermal behavior of the IC during the early stages of design. In this paper we present 3D-ICE, a compact transient thermal model (CTTM) for the thermal simulation of 3D ICs with multiple inter-tier microchannel liquid cooling. The proposed model is compatible with existing thermal CAD tools for ICs, and offers significant speed-up (up to 975x) over a typical commercial computational fluid dynamics simulation tool while preserving accuracy (i.e., maximum temperature error of 3.4%). In addition, a thermal simulator has been built based on 3D-ICE, which is capable of running in parallel on multicore architectures, offering further savings in simulation time and demonstrating efficient parallelization of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653749","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653749.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","startPage":"463","endPage":"470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-ICE: Fast compact transient thermal modeling for 3D ICs with inter-tier liquid cooling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D-ICE: Fast compact transient thermal modeling for 3D ICs with inter-tier liquid cooling","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653749/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678707","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653749/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-ICE: Fast compact transient thermal modeling for 3D ICs with inter-tier liquid cooling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07606C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114276S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653753,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407069300"},{"name":"Dimin Niu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dimin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409787700"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5653753","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) ICs promise to overcome barriers in interconnect scaling by leveraging fast, dense inter-die vias, thereby offering benefits of improved performance, higher memory bandwidth, smaller form factors, and heterogeneous integration.

IC testing is a key factor that affects the final product cost, and it could be a major portion of the total IC cost. In 3D IC design, various testing strategies and different integration methods could affect the final product cost dramatically, and the interaction with other cost factors could result in various trade-offs. This paper develops a comprehensive and parameterized testing cost model for 3D IC integration, and analyzes the trade-offs associated with testing strategies and testing circuit overheads. With the proposed testing cost model, designers can explore the most cost-effective integration and testing strategies for 3D IC chips.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653753.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"476","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-effective integration of three-dimensional (3D) ICs emphasizing testing cost analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Testing","Stacking","Integrated circuit modeling","Through-silicon vias","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit testing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional integrated circuit","cost effective integration","testing cost analysis","interconnect scaling","inter-die vias","integrated circuit testing","product cost","3D IC integration","testing circuit overheads","3D IC chips"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective integration of three-dimensional (3D) ICs emphasizing testing cost analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653753/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678697","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective integration of three-dimensional (3D) ICs emphasizing testing cost analysis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07706C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057002S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5653770,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Wei","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37536526700"},{"name":"Miodrag Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5653770","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Accuracy","Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Equations","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign","integrated circuit testing","invasive software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable segmentation","malicious circuitry detection","hardware trojans","integrated circuit","process variation","gate level characterization","input vector control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653770","abstract":"Hardware Trojans (HTs) pose a significant threat to the modern and pending integrated circuit (IC). Several approaches have been proposed to detect HTs, but they are either incapable of detecting HTs under the presence of process variation (PV) or unable to handle very large circuits in the modern IC industry. We develop a scalable HT detection and diagnosis scheme by using segmentation techniques and gate level characterization (GLC). In order to address the scalability issue, we propose a segmentation method which divides the large circuit into small sub-circuits by using input vector control. We propose a segment selection model in terms of properties of segments and their effects on GLC accuracy. The model parameters are calibrated by sampled data from the GLC process. Based on the selected segments we are able to detect and diagnose HTs correctly by tracing gate level leakage power. We evaluate our approach on several ISCAS85/ISCAS89/ITC99 benchmarks. The simulation results show that our approach is capable of detecting and diagnosing HTs accurately on large circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05653770.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653770","startPage":"483","endPage":"486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable segmentation-based malicious circuitry detection and diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653770/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable segmentation-based malicious circuitry detection and diagnosis","htmlLink":"/document/5653770/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11687907","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable segmentation-based malicious circuitry detection and diagnosis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07906C4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057074S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653771,"authors":[{"name":"Thilo Ohlemueller","affiliation":["Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany","IHP GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Thilo","lastName":"Ohlemueller","id":"37601265800"},{"name":"Frank Winkler","affiliation":["Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Winkler","id":"37373909200"},{"name":"Eckhard Grass","affiliation":["IHP GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckhard","lastName":"Grass","id":"37276988600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7158-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7157-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5653771","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","Accuracy","Antenna measurements","Transceivers","Bandwidth","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio localization","OFDM networks","round trip phase","wireless nodes","OFDM modulation","wireless transceiver","physical layer","IEEE 802.11a standard","wireless OFDM network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a localization technique for wireless nodes using OFDM modulation.

The simulation speed was compared to implementations based on alternative techniques of parallel processor programming. Moreover, the portability of OpenCL FDTD code between modern computing architectures was assessed. The average speed of OpenCL FDTD simulations on a GPU was about 1.1 times lower than a comparable CUDA based solver for domains with sizes varying from 50\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n to 400\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n cells. Although OpenCL code dedicated to GPUs can be executed on multi-core CPUs, a direct porting does not provide satisfactory performance due to an application of architecture specific features in GPU code. Therefore, the OpenCL kernels of the developed FDTD code were optimized for multi-core CPUs. However, this improved OpenCL FDTD code was still about 1.5 to 2.5 times slower than the FDTD solver developed in the OpenMP parallel programming standard. The study concludes that, despite current performance drawbacks, the future potential of OpenCL is significant due to its flexibility and portability to various architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640099/5648824/05653857.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"560","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2010.5653857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2010.5653857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method in Open Computing Language","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Graphics processing unit","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Benchmark testing","Runtime","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","parallel programming","programming languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain method","open computing language","usability","parallel processor programming","portability","computing architecture","multicore CPU","GPU code","FDTD code","OpenMP parallel programming standard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method in Open Computing Language","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653857/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11685708","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method in Open Computing Language","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065648S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640099","isNumber":"5648824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640099","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5648824","articleId":"5653857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5653864,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Yilmaz","affiliation":["Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Gebze Y\u00fcksek Teknoloji Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38105253600"},{"name":"O\u011fuz Kucur","affiliation":["Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Gebze Y\u00fcksek Teknoloji Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5653864","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Diversity reception","Relays","Transmitting antennas","Performance analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","Nakagami channels","protocols","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","amplify and forward relay system","transmit antenna selection","maximal-ratio combining","Nakagami-m fading channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653864","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5653864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5653864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05653864.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of two hop amplify and forward relay system with transmit antenna selection and maximal-ratio combining over Nakagami-m fading channels","abstract":"In this work, performance of transmit antenna selection / maximal ratio combining in a two hop amplify and forward relay system is analyzed for frequency non-selective and slowly Nakagami-m fading channels when the fading parameters of two hops are different.

Alternatively, integrated liquid-cooled microchannel heat sink becomes one of the most effective solutions. For the first time, we present fast GPU-based thermal simulation methods for 3D-ICs with integrated microchannel cooling. Based on the physical heat dissipation paths of 3D-ICs with integrated microchannels, we propose novel preconditioned iterative methods that can be efficiently accelerated on GPU's massively parallel computing platforms. Unlike the CPU-based solver development environment in which many existing sophisticated numerical simulation methods (matrix solvers) can be readily adopted and implemented, GPU-based thermal simulation demands more efforts in the algorithm and data structure design phase, and requires careful consideration of GPU's thread/memory organizations, data access/communication patterns, arithmetic intensity, as well as the hardware occupancies. As shown in various experimental results, our GPU-based 3D thermal simulation solvers can achieve up to 360X speedups over the best available direct solvers and more than 35X speedups compared with the CPU-based iterative solvers, without loss of accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design

In this paper, we propose a new SRAM design methodology that is referred to as maximum-information storage system (MISS). Unlike most traditional SRAM circuits that are designed for maximum cell density, MISS aims to maximize the information density (i.e., the number of information bits per unit area). Towards this goal, an information model is derived to quantitatively measure the information bits stored in a given SRAM system. In addition, a convex optimization framework is developed to optimize SRAM cells to achieve maximum information storage. Our design example in a commercial 65nm CMOS process demonstrates that MISS achieves more than 3.5\u00d7 area reduction over the traditional SRAM design, while storing the same amount of information. Furthermore, two real-life signal processing examples show that given the same area constraint, MISS can increase signal-to-noise ratio by more than 30 dB compared to the traditional SRAM system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5653971/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678710","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-information storage system: Concept, implementation and application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-information storage system: Concept, implementation and application","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00601B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106735S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5653971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5653991,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Aelterman","affiliation":["Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent University - TELIN - IPI - IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Aelterman","id":"37396105900"},{"name":"Hiep Quang Luong","affiliation":["Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent University - TELIN - IPI - IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hiep Quang","lastName":"Luong","id":"37398058800"},{"name":"Bart Goossens","affiliation":["Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent University - TELIN - IPI - IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Goossens","id":"37295130200"},{"name":"Aleksandra Pi\u017eurica","affiliation":["Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent University - TELIN - IPI - IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pi\u017eurica","id":"37295254100"},{"name":"Wilfried Philips","affiliation":["Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent University - TELIN - IPI - IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Philips","id":"37265643400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5653991","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Image reconstruction","Coils","Compass","Transforms","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","discrete wavelet transforms","image denoising","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","parallel Imaging MRI","image reconstruction","Compressive Parallel Sensing","COMPASS","MAP image denoising","basis pursuit formulation","discrete shearlet transform","split Bregman technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shearlet","compressive sensing","MRI","Bregman iteration","parallel imaging"]}],"abstract":"Parallel Imaging MRI (pMRI) and Compressive Sensing (CS) are two reconstruction techniques that have recently been applied to increase MRI performance. In this paper we demonstrate that a combined analysis of the pMRI and CS problems leads to a conceptually simple, yet effective technique that outperforms independent approaches to both reconstruction problems. We argue that the proposed technique is also naturally resilient to noise, due to its relation to the MAP image denoising formulation. A modified Basis Pursuit (BP) formulation of the CS-MRI problem allows it to handle the pMRI problem at the same time. We also present an exact solution to this BP problem, using the split Bregman technique, with discrete shearlet transform (DST) regularization. The DST is an excellent choice for natural image applications, due to its optimal sparsity property. Results show that this Compressive Parallel Sensing (COMPASS) reconstruction algorithm outperforms more traditional MRI reconstruction algorithms in both pMRI and CS experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compass: a joint framework for Parallel Imaging and Compressive Sensing in MRI","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653991","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05653991.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5653991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compass: a joint framework for Parallel Imaging and Compressive Sensing in MRI","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5653991/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690778","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compass: a joint framework for Parallel Imaging and Compressive Sensing in MRI","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068221S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5653991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5654000,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaorui Liu","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhaorui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593006700"},{"name":"H.

In this paper, we explore the temporal redundancy in videos, and propose a block-based adaptive framework for compressed video sampling. It addresses the independent movement of different regions in a video, classifies blocks into different types depending on their inter-frame correlation, and adjusts the sampling and reconstruction strategies accordingly. Our framework also considers the diverse texture complexity of different regions, and adaptively adjusts the number of measurements collected for each region based on their sparsity. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework reduces the number of sampled measurements by 52% to 80% while still satisfying the quality constraint on the reconstructed frames. Compared to prior works, our proposed scheme improves the quality of the reconstructed frames and achieves a 0.8dB to 5.4dB gain in the average PSNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-based adaptive compressed sensing for video","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5654000","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05654000.pdf","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5654000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Block-based adaptive compressed sensing for video","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654000/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690577","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-based adaptive compressed sensing for video","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0001649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063754S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5654000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5654012,"authors":[{"name":"Shengqiang Guo","affiliation":["Radio Communications, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Shengqiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37592650600"},{"name":"Paul Walter Baier","affiliation":["Radio Communications, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul Walter","lastName":"Baier","id":"37299596900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6015-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6013-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6014-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1943-7439"}],"articleNumber":"5654012","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"Frequency diversity is a proved remedy against the detrimental impact of the frequency selectivity of radio channels. In the case of the channel access scheme OFDM, the obvious and known approach to frequency diversity would consist in commonly spreading the data elements to be transmitted over all OFDM subcarriers. Unfortunately, this approach of full data spreading would render optimum, that is Maximum Likelihood data despreading in the receiver prohibitively expensive so that only less complex suboptimum despreading schemes based on Zero Forcing or on still quite expensive iterative procedures remain. In order to overcome this situation, we propose in the present paper the scheme of partial data spreading. In this scheme the data elements to be transmitted are partitioned into subsets, and the data elements of each of these subsets are commonly spread only over a corresponding subset of the OFDM subcarriers. In this way, optimum data despreading becomes feasible. Our simulation results show that, as compared to un-spread transmission and depending on the characteristics of the radio channel, a significant reduction of the required SNR can be achieved. We consider OFDM transmission with rate 1/2 convolutional coding, QPSK data modulation, and soft input Viterbi decoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640355/5648820/05654012.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5654012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5654012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial data spreading, an efficient and inexpensive approach to combating frequency selectivity in coded OFDM transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise measurement","Frequency diversity","Receivers","Artificial neural networks","Lead","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Viterbi decoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM transmission","frequency diversity","radio channels","OFDM subcarriers","maximum likelihood data despreading","SNR","convolutional codes","QPSK data modulation","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spread spectrum techniques","OFDM mobile radio communications","frequency selectivity","data spreading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Partial data spreading, an efficient and inexpensive approach to combating frequency selectivity in coded OFDM transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654012/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732695","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial data spreading, an efficient and inexpensive approach to combating frequency selectivity in coded OFDM transmission","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"17c31569315093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065486S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640355","isNumber":"5648820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640355","xplore-issue":"5648820","articleId":"5654012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5654021,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Xiao Xiang","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Methodik der Femerkundung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Xiao Xiang","id":"37085705724"},{"name":"Richard Bamler","affiliation":["Germa Aerospace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), Germany","Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Methodik der Femerkundung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bamler","id":"37269413600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5654021","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1047},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Estimation","Robustness","Minimization","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential SAR tomography","SL1MMER algorithm","synthetic aperture principle","4D imaging","meter-resolution space-borne SAR system","TerraSAR-X","systematic tomographic imaging","urban infrastructure","tomographic system formulation","differential tomographic inversion","2D compressive sensing","nonparametric method","parametric method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["differential SAR tomography","nonlinear motion","compressive sensing","SL1MMER","super-resolution","TerraSAR-X"]}],"abstract":"Differential SAR tomography extends the synthetic aperture principle into the elevation and time directions for 4-D imaging. With modern meter-resolution space-borne SAR systems like TerraSAR-X (TS-X), systematic tomographic imaging of urban infrastructure and its deformations becomes feasible. We demonstrate the potential of TS-X data for this purpose and introduce several novel concepts. Since building deformation in general is nonlinear, e.g. due to thermal dilation, we start from a tomographic system formulation that is general enough to allow for the inclusion of motion models (linear, periodic, etc.). By appropriate warping of the time axis we map the motion model function to become linear and lead to a peak in the spectral domain. For the differential tomographic inversion itself we propose a 2-D compressive sensing (CS) based approach - \u201cSL1MMER\u201d. We demonstrate the super-resolution power and the robustness of SL1MMER both with simulated and with real data. We also show that it provides an attractive compromise between parametric and non-parametric methods. A full reconstruction of a building complex and its seasonal deformation from a stack of TS-X spotlight data is finally presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for high resolution differential SAR tomography - the SL1MMER algorithm","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654021","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05654021.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for high resolution differential SAR tomography - the SL1MMER algorithm","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654021/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11686172","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for high resolution differential SAR tomography - the SL1MMER algorithm","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0000017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048248S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5654021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654055,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing & Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405715700"},{"name":"Yue Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing & Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37399619800"},{"name":"Junchi Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing & Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Junchi","lastName":"Yan","id":"37407421600"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing & Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280203600"},{"name":"Xiangjian He","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Sydney University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangjian","lastName":"He","id":"37293267000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7994-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7992-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7993-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"5654055","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Sparse matrices","Nickel","Matrix decomposition","Optimization","Visualization","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","data visualisation","error correction","image denoising","image reconstruction","signal detection","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor error correction","visual data corruption","multichannel image","acquisition process","low-rank matrix","trace norm minimization","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tensor decomposition","trace norm minimization","sparse coding","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"The multi-channel image or the video clip has the natural form of tensor.

In this paper, we study the relationship between these two optimizations and show empirically that there are strong ties between them. Specifically, we analyze the power and reliability optimization problems in FPGA physical synthesis (i.e., packing, placement, and routing), and show that the intrinsic structures of these two problems are very similar. Supported by the post routing results with detailed power and reliability analysis for a wide selection of benchmark circuits, we show that with minimal changes - fewer than one hundred lines of C code - an existing power-aware physical synthesis tool can be used to minimize the fault rate of a circuit under SEU faults. As a by-product of this study, we also show that one can improve the mean-time-to-failure by 100% with negligible area and delay overhead by performing fault-tolerant physical synthesis for FPGAs. The results from this study show a great potential to develop CAD systems co-optimized for power and fault-tolerance.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05654149.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On power and fault-tolerance optimization in FPGA physical synthesis","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On power and fault-tolerance optimization in FPGA physical synthesis","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687893","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654149/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On power and fault-tolerance optimization in FPGA physical synthesis","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03603B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114554S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5654149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654155,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Tsung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Tsung","lastName":"Chang","id":"38184179800"},{"name":"Chih-Cheng Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Cheng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37595246600"},{"name":"Mark Po-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mark Po-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37597013500"},{"name":"Yu-Wen Tsai","affiliation":["Faraday Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wen","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37594641800"},{"name":"Sheng-Fong Chen","affiliation":["Faraday Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Fong","lastName":"Chen","id":"38179947000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5654155","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":883},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Timing","Power demand","Pins","Mathematical model","Clocks","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","clocks","flip-flops","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibit flip-flops","post-placement power optimization","nanometer integrated circuit design","power consumption","clock network","placement density","timing slack constraints","interconnecting wirelength","industry benchmark circuits"]}],"abstract":"Optimization for power is always one of the most important design objectives in modern nanometer IC design. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of applying multi-bit flip-flops to save the power consumption of the clock network. However, all the previous works applied multi-bit flip-flops at earlier design stages, which could be very difficult to carry out the trade-off among power, timing, and other design objectives. This paper presents a novel power optimization method by incrementally applying more multi-bit flip-flops at the post-placement stage to gain more clock power saving while considering the placement density and timing slack constraints, and simultaneously minimizing interconnecting wirelength. Experimental results based on the industry benchmark circuits show that our approach is very effective and efficient, which can be seamlessly integrated in modern design flow.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654155","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05654155.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-placement power optimization with multi-bit flip-flops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Post-placement power optimization with multi-bit flip-flops","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654155/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678620","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654155/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-placement power optimization with multi-bit flip-flops","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03503B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074594S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5654155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5654157,"authors":[{"name":"Michael T.

The procurement and fielding of the ARCHER system provided useful practical experience in terms of moving hyperspectral remote sensing into an operational context, including areas where further advances are needed. It also provided an airborne collection platform with which to experiment and refine target detection and change detection algorithms to gain greater insight into detection performance. Many of the system and algorithm characteristics and refinements have been reported previously in the literature. This paper attempts to go one step further in providing several of the key lessons-learned from CAP ARCHER experience, with a specific aim to illuminate the areas where further progress is needed and suggest approaches that may address these remaining shortfalls.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11685920","htmlLink":"/document/5654157/","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automated hyperspectral target detection and change detection from an airborne platform: Progress and challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated hyperspectral target detection and change detection from an airborne platform: Progress and challenges","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0004354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0446S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5654157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654160,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jiang","affiliation":["CUhk REliable Computing Laboratory (CURE), Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37590959900"},{"name":"Rong Ye","affiliation":["CUhk REliable Computing Laboratory (CURE), Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Ye","id":"37447323200"},{"name":"Qiang Xu","affiliation":["CUhk REliable Computing Laboratory (CURE), Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277384200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5654160","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":602},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Circuit faults","Redundancy","Bonding","Memory management","Three dimensional displays","Optimal matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit yield","integrated memory circuits","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["yield enhancement","3D-stacked memory","redundancy sharing across dies","three-dimensional memory products","storage capacity","short through-silicon vias"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) memory products are emerging to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of storage capacity. In 3D-stacked memory, redundancy sharing between neighboring vertical memory blocks using short through-silicon vias (TSVs) is a promising solution for yield enhancement. Since different memory dies are with distinct fault bitmaps, how to selectively matching them together to maximize the yield for the bonded 3D-stacked memory is an interesting and relevant problem.

Compared to conventional laboratory procedures, which are cumbersome and expensive, miniaturized digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) offer the advantages of higher sensitivity, lower cost, system integration, and less likelihood of human error. This tutorial paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of biochips, from physical modeling to fluidic-level synthesis and then to chip-level design.

Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is an executable algorithm and outperforms the existing orthogonal 4-tap integer multiwavelet transform algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5654201","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05654201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5654201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal 4-tap integer multiwavelet transforms using matrix factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal 4-tap integer multiwavelet transforms using matrix factorization","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654201/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690459","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal 4-tap integer multiwavelet transforms using matrix factorization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076017S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5654201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654203,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Our work is a major improvement over the work proposed in. First, a new kind of full Steiner trees (FSTs) called obstacle-avoiding full Steiner trees (OAFSTs) is proposed. We show that for any OARSMT problem there exists an optimal tree composed of OAFSTs only. We then extend the proofs on the possible topologies of FSTs in to find the possible topologies of OAFSTs, showing that OAFSTs can be constructed easily. A two-phase algorithm for the construction of OARSMTs is then developed. In the first phase, a sufficient number of OAFSTs are generated. In the second phase, the OAFSTs are used to construct an OARSMT. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves 185 times speedup on average and is able to solve more benchmarks than the approach in.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654220","startPage":"610","endPage":"613","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05654220.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction: An optimal approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steiner trees","Routing","Benchmark testing","Joining processes","IP networks","Silicon","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","integrated circuit design","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction","full Steiner trees","OARSMT problem","optimal tree","two-phase algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction: An optimal approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654220/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687890","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree construction: An optimal approach","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10008B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0548S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5654220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5654229,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Chul Kim","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Myung-Chul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37597329100"},{"name":"Dong-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406583200"},{"name":"Igor L.

Keep-out zone (KOZ) is a conservative way to prevent any devices/cells from being impacted by the TSV-induced stress. However, owing to already large TSV size, large KOZ can significantly reduce the placement area available for cells, thus requiring larger dies which negate improvement in wirelength and timing due to 3D integration. In this paper, we study the impact of KOZ dimension on stress, carrier mobility variation, area, wirelength, and performance of 3D ICs. We demonstrate that, instead of requiring large KOZ, 3D-IC placers must exploit TSV stress-induced carrier mobility variation to improve the timing and area objectives during placement. We propose a new TSV stress-driven force-directed 3D placement that consistently provides placement result with, on average, 21.6% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 28.0% better total negative slack (TNS) than wirelength-driven placement.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654245","startPage":"669","endPage":"674","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05654245.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stress-driven 3D-IC placement with TSV keep-out zone and regularity study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654245/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stress-driven 3D-IC placement with TSV keep-out zone and regularity study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11678646","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654245/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress-driven 3D-IC placement with TSV keep-out zone and regularity study","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"11009A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066153S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5654245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5654255,"authors":[{"name":"Minki Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Minki","lastName":"Cho","id":"37401638700"},{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38184435100"},{"name":"Dae Hyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Dae Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38596635200"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8194-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8193-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8192-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"CD","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"5654255","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":767},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Three dimensional displays","Delay","Degradation","Resistance","Flip-flops","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit testing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through silicon vias","TSV defect","signal degradation","3D system","3D integrated circuit","signal recovery circuit","signal fidelity","test/recovery structure","stand alone simulations","full-chip physical design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654255","abstract":"In this paper we present a test structure and design methodology for testing, characterization, and self-repair of TSVs in 3D ICs.

The problem is especially pronounced for lower level metals used for local routing, where bi-directionality gives rise to lithography unfriendly layout patterns. However, one can modify such wires without significantly affecting design behavior. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously modify mask and target during OPC to improve lithographic yield. The method uses image slope information, available during image simulation at no extra cost, as a measure of process window. We derive a cost function that maximizes both contour fidelity and robustness to drive our simultaneous mask and target optimization (SMATO) method. We then develop analytical equations to predict the cost for a given mask and target modification and use a fast algorithm to minimize this cost function to obtain an optimal mask and target solution. Our experiments on sample metal1 (M1) layouts show that the use of SMATO reduces the Process Manufacturability Index (PMI) by 15.4% compared to OPC, which further leads to 69% reduction in the number of layout hotspots. Additionally, such improvement is obtained at low average runtime overhead (5.5%). Compared to PWOPC, we observe 4.6% improvement in PMI at large (2.6X) improvement in runtime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMATO: Simultaneous mask and target optimization for improving lithographic process window","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654341","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5638200/5648785/05654341.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"SMATO: Simultaneous mask and target optimization for improving lithographic process window","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654341/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMATO: Simultaneous mask and target optimization for improving lithographic process window","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01502A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071831S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5638200","isNumber":"5648785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5638200","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5648785","articleId":"5654341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654347,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Shuen Tang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Shuen","lastName":"Tang","id":"37595824600"},{"name":"Chao-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600148000"},{"name":"Chi-chao Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-chao","lastName":"Chao","id":"37268521600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6015-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6013-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6014-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-7447"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-7439"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1943-7439"}],"articleNumber":"5654347","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654347","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boolean functions","Correlation","Upper bound","Multiaccess communication","Error correction codes","Interference","Chaotic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","correlation methods","sequences","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero correlation zone sequence","Boolean function","ZCZ sequence set"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new direct construction of zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence sets based on the generalized Boolean functions is proposed.

Existing algorithms suffer from the \u201cfreezing robot\u201d problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in \u201cjoint collision avoidance\u201d: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5654369","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05654369.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5654369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","startPage":"797","endPage":"803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unfreezing the robot: Navigation in dense, interacting crowds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unfreezing the robot: Navigation in dense, interacting crowds","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654369/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689070","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654369/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unfreezing the robot: Navigation in dense, interacting crowds","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058673S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5654369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5654373,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Moreover, we show that ignoring the effect of mutual coupling gives misleading results, yielding unbounded capacity growth. As another key finding, we demonstrate the surprising result that if the optimal antenna configuration is employed, then further optimizing the transmission based on the channel statistics gives very little benefit over simple equal-power spatial multiplexing. By deriving an expression for the capacity at low SNR, we provide a straightforward method for estimating the optimal number of antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05654383.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5654383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5654383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO systems with mutual coupling: How many antennas to pack into fixed-length arrays?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","Correlation","Antenna arrays","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","mutual coupling","fixed-length arrays","multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","spatial correlation","optimal antenna configuration","transmission wavelength","channel statistics","equal-power spatial multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","correlation","mutual coupling","capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO systems with mutual coupling: How many antennas to pack into fixed-length arrays?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654383/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732739","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO systems with mutual coupling: How many antennas to pack into fixed-length arrays?","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"95c31569314445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068966S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5654383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654389,"authors":[{"name":"Roope Vehkalahti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Roope","lastName":"Vehkalahti","id":"37540588400"},{"name":"Camilla Hollanti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Hollanti","id":"37284021000"},{"name":"Jyrki Lahtonen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyrki","lastName":"Lahtonen","id":"37283209600"},{"name":"Hsiao-feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274988800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5654389","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","Lattices","Encoding","Fading","Decoding","Complexity theory","Space time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO codes","multiple-input single-output codes","transmit antennas","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","full-diversity quasi-orthogonal codes","division algebraic constructions","slow fading MISO channel","MISO multi-block codes","linear worst-case sphere decoding complexity"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers certain aspects of some well-known multiple-input single-output (MISO) codes.

It is also pointed out that unitary conjugation does not change the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of a code. These simple results are then applied to analyze the DMT of several well-known MISO codes. In particular its is proved that all the considered codes are DMT optimal. As a by-product of this study it is seen that the full-diversity quasi-orthogonal codes by Su and Xia are unitarily equivalent to division algebraic constructions. This relation is then used to place the constructions by Su and Xia into a wider context.

To reach the boundary of the rate region, the sum rate is maximized subject to a rate ratio constraint. Furthermore, the sum rate is approximated as an affine function of the logarithm of the SNR and the two parameters of this approximation, which are the multiplexing gain (MG) and the rate offset (RO), are derived. This leads directly to the asymptotic rate region, particularly interesting because it is obtained in simple analytical form and offers a good approximation at high but finite SNR. We then consider the rate region boundary at finite SNR and derive algorithmic bounds for it, which are accurate even at intermediate SNR.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5654399","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05654399.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5654399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO broadcast channel rate region with linear precoding at high SNR without full multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654399/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO broadcast channel rate region with linear precoding at high SNR without full multiplexing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732741","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654399/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO broadcast channel rate region with linear precoding at high SNR without full multiplexing","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"97c51569319087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093007S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5654399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5654406,"authors":[{"name":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr Argun\u015fah","affiliation":["M\u00fchendislik ve Do\u011fa Bilimleri Fak\u00fcltesi, Sabanc\u0131 \u00dcniversitesi, Tuzla, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye","Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia, Oeiras, Portekiz"],"firstName":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Argun\u015fah","id":"38555284100"},{"name":"M\u00fcjdat \u00c7etin","affiliation":["M\u00fchendislik ve Do\u011fa Bilimleri Fak\u00fcltesi, Sabanc\u0131 \u00dcniversitesi, Tuzla, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"M\u00fcjdat","lastName":"\u00c7etin","id":"37285046400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5654406","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Electroencephalography","Brain modeling","Markov processes","Brain computer interfaces","Principal component analysis","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","image classification","medical signal processing","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interface algorithm","hidden Markov model","dimensionality reduction","motor imagery EEG data classification","HMM based technique","autoregressive parameter","principal component analysis"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of motor imagery EEG data classification within the context of brain-computer interfaces.

The optimal load response to a real-time electricity price for demand side management generates different load profiles and may have some impacts on power system constraints, such as voltage limits and capacity limits. The western Danish power system, which is currently the grid area in the world that has the largest share of wind power in its generation profiles and may represent the future of electricity markets in some ways, is chosen as the studied power system in this paper. A distribution system where wind power capacity is 126% of maximum loads is chosen as the study case. This paper presents a nonlinear load optimization method to real-time power price for demand side management in order to save the energy costs as much as possible. Simulation results show that the optimal load response to a real-time electricity price has some good impacts on power system constraints in a distribution system with high wind power penetrations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648789","publicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","displayPublicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637220/5648789/05654409.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of optimal load response to real-time electricity price on power system constraints in Denmark","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of optimal load response to real-time electricity price on power system constraints in Denmark","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654409/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11688022","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654409/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of optimal load response to real-time electricity price on power system constraints in Denmark","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"E23178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056989S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637220","isNumber":"5648789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637220","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648789","articleId":"5654409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Cardiff University","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5654422,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammet Uzuntarla","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Zonguldak Karaelmas \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Muhammet","lastName":"Uzuntarla","id":"38228719300"},{"name":"Mahmut \u00d6zer","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Zonguldak Karaelmas \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mahmut","lastName":"\u00d6zer","id":"37673098100"},{"name":"Etem K\u00f6kl\u00fckaya","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Sakarya \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Etem","lastName":"K\u00f6kl\u00fckaya","id":"37330623200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5654422","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654422","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Firing","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Art","Mathematical model","Biological neural networks","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomembrane transport","feedforward neural nets","molecular biophysics","neurophysiology","noise","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy feedforward biological neural network","input firing rate propagation","multiple layers","dynamical behaviour","stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley equations","probabilistic nature","neuronal membranes","ion channel noise","cell size","synchronization mechanism","synaptic current variance","intrinsic channel noise strength","optimal value"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2010.5654422","pdfPath":"/iel5/5636061/5648807/05654422.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 18th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2010.5654422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of firing rate in a noisy feedforward biological neural network","abstract":"In this study, we investigate the input firing rate propagation in a feedforward biological neural network composed of multiple layers. Dynamical behaviour of neurons in the network are modeled by using stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley equations which considers the probabilistic nature of ion channels embedded in neuronal membranes. Thus, firing rate propagation is studied in a biophysically more realistic manner by including ion channel noise which is ignored in previous studies. Input rate information in the network is provided by varying the cell size in the first layer. We show that the efficient transmission of input firing rate through the network can be achieved via the synchronization mechanism within the neurons in layers. We also show that this synchronization araise from the synaptic current variance increase and provided by adjusting the cell size or the intrinsic channel noise strength in layers to an optimal value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654422/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11688101","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654422/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Propagation of firing rate in a noisy feedforward biological neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of firing rate in a noisy feedforward biological neural network","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047532S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5654422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654429,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Herdt","affiliation":["INRIA, Rhone-Alpes, France","UMI3218/CRT, CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Herdt","id":"37585709500"},{"name":"Nicolas Perrin","affiliation":["CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse LAAS, Toulouse, France","UMI3218/CRT, CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Perrin","id":"37546414100"},{"name":"Pierre-Brice Wieber","affiliation":["INRIA, Rhone-Alpes, France","UMI3218/CRT, CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Pierre-Brice","lastName":"Wieber","id":"37295495700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5654429","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":699},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Foot","Trajectory","Joints","Optimization","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","humanoid robots","legged locomotion","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion generation","stable bipedal walking motions","feet","trunk","polygonal constraints","support phases","automatic control","humanoid robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Walking Humanoid Robot","Linear Model Predictive Control"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate in this paper our motion generation sheme for the generation of stable bipedal walking motions and we expand it to enhance its flexibility and independency.

In particular, we present examples of remote labs developed by two of the university groups taking part in AutomatL@bs. We then present the automatic booking system that manages the access of users to each laboratory's didactical setup. Next, we show the integration process of every component into a Learning Management System (LMS). Finally, an overall system assessment of the students' perception of the quality of the experimental environment as a learning tool is analyzed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","startPage":"197","endPage":"208","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2010.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2010.35","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620076/6015589/05654493.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network of Automatic Control Web-Based Laboratories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654493/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Network of Automatic Control Web-Based Laboratories","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216475","volume":"4","issue":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654493/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Network of Automatic Control Web-Based Laboratories","sourcePdf":"tlt2011030197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065514S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"6015589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6015589","articleId":"5654493","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5654494,"authors":[{"name":"Bertrand Schneider","affiliation":["CRAFT-Centre de Recherche et d'Appui pour la Formation et ses Technologies, EPFL-Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/6015589/5654494/5654494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bertrand Schneider received two master's degrees, one in psychology and one in learning and teaching technologies, from the Geneva University.

The resource allocation problem is posed as an optimization problem with individual user constraints. This formulation provides a special structure that lends to efficient solution of the problem. We develop an optimal algorithm based on standard graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation. Based on the special structure of the problem, the proposed resource allocation algorithm attains the optimal solution at a much lower complexity compared to general-purpose optimization algorithms used by previous OFDMA resource allocation approaches. Moreover, the resource allocation problem solved by the proposed algorithm supports practical features such as discrete modulation set and multiple OFDM symbols per resource allocation decision. Furthermore, by assuming even power allocation across the OFDM subchannels, a suboptimal resource allocation algorithm with lower complexity is developed. The proposed algorithms enable the system designer to control the tradeoffs among system performance, system complexity, and the quality of service (QoS) experienced by the users. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance and complexity of the proposed algorithms under different system operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5898460/05654507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898460","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Efficient Graph-Based Resource Allocation Algorithms for Multiservice Frame-Based OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Efficient Graph-Based Resource Allocation Algorithms for Multiservice Frame-Based OFDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12068906","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5654507/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Efficient Graph-Based Resource Allocation Algorithms for Multiservice Frame-Based OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011081175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093134S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5898460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5898460","articleId":"5654507","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5654510,"authors":[{"name":"Carmela Troncoso","affiliation":["IBBT-Katholieke, Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/5954680/5654510/5654510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carmela Troncoso received the master's degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Vigo in 2006.

However, their current implementations, in which fine-grained location data are sent to insurers, entail a serious privacy risk. We present PriPAYD, a system where the premium calculations are performed locally in the vehicle, and only aggregated data are sent to the insurance company, without leaking location information. Our design is based on well-understood security techniques that ensure its correct functioning. We discuss the viability of PriPAYD in terms of cost, security, and ease of certification. We demonstrate that PriPAYD is possible through a proof-of-concept implementation that shows how privacy can be obtained at a very reasonable extra cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5954680/05654510.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2010.71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2010.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5954680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PriPAYD: Privacy-Friendly Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insurance","Companies","Global Positioning System","Privacy","Roads","GSM","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","insurance data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PriPAYD","privacy-friendly pay-as-you-drive insurance","car insurance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system security","legal factors","privacy."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"PriPAYD: Privacy-Friendly Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5654510/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12110502","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PriPAYD: Privacy-Friendly Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance","sourcePdf":"ttq2011050742.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151215S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5954680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5954680","articleId":"5654510","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5654516,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nilanjan Mukherjee leads a technical group in the Design-to-Silicon Division at Mentor Graphics.

A proposed socio-ecological energy system (SEES) framework used to characterize the core-level subsystems (resources, users, and governance) in terms of second-level and deeper level variables is motivated by the more general multilevel nested socio-ecological system (SES) framework. Second-level and deeper level variables are introduced as a means of characterizing how sustainable a SEES is likely to be by assessing their characteristics. Given vast spatial and temporal complexities in a typical SEES, it becomes necessary to enhance the physical power network with just-in-time (JIT), just-in-place (JIP), and just-in-context (JIC) functionalities. These, in turn, support sustainable energy services by aligning temporal, spatial, and contextual characteristics of resources and users. We refer to the ICT implementation in support of these functionalities as dynamic monitoring and decision systems (DYMONDS). The tradeoffs between the ability of the SEES to ensure sustainable services and the complexity of the supporting smart grid are discussed for several representative energy system architectures.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2089478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2089478","startPage":"58","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5669979/05654527.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems for Enabling Sustainable Energy Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems for Enabling Sustainable Energy Services","volume":"99","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698362","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5654527/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems for Enabling Sustainable Energy Services","sourcePdf":"jproc-ilic-2089478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07668S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5669979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5669979","articleId":"5654527","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5654535,"authors":[{"name":"Puneet Srivastava","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Puneet","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37411454400"},{"name":"Jo Das","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Das","id":"37304620000"},{"name":"Domenica Visalli","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Domenica","lastName":"Visalli","id":"37393095800"},{"name":"Marleen Van Hove","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marleen","lastName":"Van Hove","id":"37266036300"},{"name":"Pawel E.

For this purpose the capacity performance of typical base station and mobile station antennas in a simulated macro-cellular scenario with varying antenna inter element spacings and antenna rotation will be studied. The model is based on the modal description of typical receiving and transmitting antennas. In this manner a significant simulation time reduction is achieved which allows for faster analysis and optimization. To prove this the effects of both the mobile and base station antennas are investigated. Moreover, for the more restrictive case of base station antennas, a fully modal descriptive model is proven to yield very similar results as those from measured commercial antennas. It is found that the modal approach improves simulation speed without loss of accuracy or generality. Simulations are done for the city of Karlsruhe with a three-dimensional Ray-tracing tool.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5705613/05654566.pdf","startPage":"643","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2096179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2096179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modal Network Model for MIMO Antenna in-System Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Base stations","Antenna measurements","Dipole antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna","system optimization","MIMO system","modal network model","capacity performance","base station antenna","mobile station antenna","macro-cellular scenario","antenna inter element spacing","antenna rotation","receiving antenna","transmitting antenna","3D Ray-tracing tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","antenna optimization","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","MIMO network model","network theory","path-based channel models","spherical mode expansion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modal Network Model for MIMO Antenna in-System Optimization","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5654566/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11804788","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal Network Model for MIMO Antenna in-System Optimization","sourcePdf":"tap-pontes-2096179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058806S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5705613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5705613","articleId":"5654566","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654569,"authors":[{"name":"Juan D.

The communication with a moving person in an indoor environment can be very unreliable due to channel fading. In addition, when considering off-body communication by means of textile antennas, propagation is affected by shadowing caused by the human body. By transmitting and receiving signals using multiple-input, multiple-output antennas (MIMO communication) a large improvement in reliability of the wireless link is obtained. In this contribution, the performance of wireless data communication using quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) modulated data in the 2.45 GHz ISM-band is evaluated in the case of firefighters walking indoor and communicating by means of a compact dual-pattern dual-polarization diversity textile patch antenna system integrated into their clothing. Simultaneous transmit diversity (at the firefighter) and receive diversity (at the base station) up to fourth order are achieved by means of orthogonal space-time codes, providing a maximum total diversity order of 16. The measurements confirm that MIMO techniques drastically improve the reliability of the wireless link. Measurements are compared for three test persons of significantly different sizes. For equal transmitted power levels, the bit error rates for the 2 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4 links are much lower than for a system without diversity, with the 4 \u00d7 4 system clearly providing the best performance.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2096389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5705613/05654572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2096389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705613","startPage":"631","endPage":"642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Off-Body Wireless MIMO Communication With Dual Polarized Textile Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Off-Body Wireless MIMO Communication With Dual Polarized Textile Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654572/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11804793","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5654572/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Off-Body Wireless MIMO Communication With Dual Polarized Textile Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-vantorre-2096389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09839S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5705613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5705613","articleId":"5654572","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654574,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Wei Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Wei","lastName":"Kang","id":"37535690500"},{"name":"Kin-Lu Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kin-Lu","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682300"},{"name":"Liang-Che Chou","affiliation":["High Frequency Business Unit, Nantze Branch, Yageo Corporation, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Che","lastName":"Chou","id":"37283323100"},{"name":"Ming-Ren Hsu","affiliation":["High Frequency Business Unit, Nantze Branch, Yageo Corporation, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Ren","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37534224500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5654574","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2747},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Antenna feeds","Portable computers","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","laptop computers","Long Term Evolution","mobile antennas","monopole antennas","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled-fed shorted monopole","radiating feed structure","eight-band LTE/WWAN operation","laptop computer","LTE700/GSM850/900/1800/ 1900/UMTS/LTE2300/2500","antenna feed","loop feed","wideband resonant modes","radiation performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled-fed antennas","internal laptop computer antennas","LTE antennas","shorted monopoles","WWAN antennas"]}],"abstract":"A coupled-fed shorted monopole with its feed structure as an effective radiator for eight-band LTE/WWAN (LTE700/GSM850/900/1800/ 1900/UMTS/LTE2300/2500) operation in the laptop computer is presented.

The lens-fed antenna has the form of two layers, which is a new approach to reducing the size of the Rotman lens. The approach is demonstrated at 24 GHz aiming for an automotive sensing radar. The lens consists of a top metal layer, a dielectric, a common ground, a dielectric, and a bottom metal layer, in sequential order. The layout of the lens body is placed on the bottom layer and the antennas are placed on the top layer. Both of them are electrically connected through slot transitions. This two-layer structure reduces not only the total size of the lens, but also the loss of the delay lines because the lines can be designed to be as short and straight as possible. The two-layer Rotman lens-fed antenna array is measured in terms of scattering parameters and beam patterns. From the scattering parameters, the power efficiencies of the beam port 1, 2, and 3 at 24 GHz are obtained as 32.3%, 48.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. The measured beam patterns show that the beam directions are -28.1\u00b0, -14.9\u00b0, 0\u00b0, 15.5\u00b0, and 28.6\u00b0 and the beamwidths are 13.4\u00b0, 13.2\u00b0, 12.8\u00b0, 13.5\u00b0, and 13.0\u00b0. The measurements confirm that the compact two-layer Rotman lens has been successfully demonstrated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2096380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705613","startPage":"460","endPage":"466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5705613/05654577.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Two-Layer Rotman Lens-Fed Microstrip Antenna Array at 24 GHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654577/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compact Two-Layer Rotman Lens-Fed Microstrip Antenna Array at 24 GHz","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11804798","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Two-Layer Rotman Lens-Fed Microstrip Antenna Array at 24 GHz","sourcePdf":"tap-yoon-2096380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051684S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5705613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5705613","articleId":"5654577","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5654578,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-An Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5705613/5654578/5654578-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi-An Zheng was born in Xiajiang, Jiangxi, China, on June 3, 1985.

The radiator is a stepped slot excited by a 50 \u03a9 feed line. By etching a half-wavelength and a quarter-wavelength slot from the ground plane of UWB slot antennas, respectively, two UWB antennas with band-notched characteristics can be obtained. The potential interference between UWB and WLAN/WiMAX can be reduced. Omnidirectional radiation patterns and constant gain can be observed in the pass bands. Time-domain characteristics of both proposed antennas are analyzed under different conditions. It demonstrates that the time-domain characteristics of the antennas are good enough for UWB applications.

However, one of the major issues with these schemes is that they are computationally expensive. Though techniques have been proposed to address this problem, they often result in degradations in performance. This paper proposes a new, highly flexible, approach which allows the computational load required for noise compensation to be controlled while maintaining good performance. The scheme applies the improved joint uncertainty decoding with the predictive linear transform framework. The final compensation is implemented as a set of linear transforms of the features, decoupling the computational cost of compensation from the complexity of the recognition system acoustic models. Furthermore, by using linear transforms, changes in the correlations in the feature vector can also be efficiently modeled. The proposed methods can be easily applied in an adaptive training scheme, including discriminative adaptive training. The performance of the approach is compared to a number of standard schemes on Aurora 2 as well as in-car speech recognition tasks. Results indicate that the proposed scheme is an attractive alternative to existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12021185","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Uncertainty Decoding With Predictive Methods for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Uncertainty Decoding With Predictive Methods for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-chin-2096214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042172S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5654579","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654581,"authors":[{"name":"Dalei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5772995/5654581/5654581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dalei Wu received the B.S. degree in computer science from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in computational linguistics from Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany, in 2006.","Since 2008, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

In our previous work, LME of HMMs has been successfully applied to some small-scale speech recognition tasks, using the SDP (semi-definite programming) technique. In this paper, we further extend the previous work by exploring a more efficient convex optimization method with the technique of second-order cone programming (SOCP). More specifically, we have studied and proposed several SOCP relaxation techniques to convert LME of HMMs in speech recognition into a standard SOCP problem so that LME can be solved with more efficient SOCP methods. The formulation is general enough to deal with various types of competing hypothesis space, such as N-best lists and word graphs. The proposed LME/SOCP approaches have been evaluated on two standard speech recognition tasks. The experimental results on the TIDIGITS task show that the SOCP method significantly outperforms the gradient descent method, and achieve comparable performance with SDP, but with 20-200 times faster speed, requiring less memory and computing resources. Furthermore, the proposed LME/SOCP method has also been successfully applied to a large vocabulary task using the Wall Street Journals (WSJ0) database. The WSJ-5k recognition results show that the proposed method yields better performance than the conventional approaches including maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE), and more recent boosted MMIE methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Margin Estimation of Hidden Markov Models With Second-Order Cone Programming for Speech Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2096213","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5772995/05654581.pdf","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2096213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Large-Margin Estimation of Hidden Markov Models With Second-Order Cone Programming for Speech Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5654581/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12021187","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Margin Estimation of Hidden Markov Models With Second-Order Cone Programming for Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-jiang-2096213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091311S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5772995","articleId":"5654581","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654591,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Shaghaghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Shaghaghi","id":"37593379600"},{"name":"Kui Cai","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Cai","id":"37391393000"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Zhiliang Qin","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Qin","id":"37401670400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5654591","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Monte Carlo methods","Decoding","Markov processes","Computational complexity","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","intersymbol interference","magnetic recording","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov chain Monte Carlo Based detection","two-dimensional intersymbol interference channels","ultra-high-density data storage technologies","turbo decoding","low-density parity check channel code","LDPC channel code","ultra-high-density bit-patterned magnetic recording systems","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BCJR algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","Markov chain Monte Carlo methods","turbo decoding","two-dimensional intersymbol interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654591","abstract":"Recent advances in ultra-high-density data storage technologies have led to two-dimensional (2-D) intersymbol interference (ISI) in the system.

Our study shows that the proposed detection method significantly reduces the computational burden, while achieving performance better than the BCJR based detection method.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2096228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5697331/05654591.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2096228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Based Detection for Two-Dimensional Intersymbol Interference Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Based Detection for Two-Dimensional Intersymbol Interference Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654591/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769587","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Based Detection for Two-Dimensional Intersymbol Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tmag-qin-2096228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07908S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5697331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5697331","articleId":"5654591","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654594,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Cheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Microsystems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5978261/5654594/5654594-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuo Cheng (S\u201910) received the B.E. degree in automation from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His current research interests include electromechanical transducers and their applications in power generation, conversion, and transmission systems."]},"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37594925700"},{"name":"Ying Jin","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5978261/5654594/5654594-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Jin received the B.Sc. degree in electrical science and technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, in 2010, with a focus on circuits design.","She is currently a System Hardware Engineer at Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA.

It is shown that the hysteresis plays an important role in the rectification characteristics, circuit stability, and overall efficiency. Experimentally, the circuit is able to rectify input voltage amplitude as low as 5 mV and operates over a frequency range of 1 to 500 Hz, which spans most common mechanical vibrations. For input voltage amplitudes 250 mV or higher, the circuit exhibits >;80% efficiency for a range of load resistances, delivering 0.1-10 mW of power.

In the presence of large steering vector mismatches, the uncertainty set has to expand to accommodate the increased error. This degrades the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of these beamformers since their interference-plus-noise suppression abilities are weakened. In this paper, an iterative robust minimum variance beamformer (IRMVB) is proposed which uses a small uncertainty sphere (and a small flat ellipsoid) to search for the desired array steering vector iteratively. This preserves the interference-plus-noise suppression ability of the proposed beamformer and results in a higher output SINR. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11851191","htmlLink":"/document/5654599/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Robust Minimum Variance Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Robust Minimum Variance Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-nai-2096222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08761S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5725269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5725269","articleId":"5654599","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5654601,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Paysarvi-Hoseini","affiliation":["ICORE Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5654601/5654601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedram Paysarvi-Hoseini (S'08) received the B.

The framework, which is referred to as multiband sensing-time-adaptive joint detection, improves the overall secondary user performance while protecting the primary network and keeping the harmful interference below a desired low level. Considering a periodic sensing scheme, the detection problem is formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize the aggregate achievable secondary throughput capacity given a bound on the aggregate interference imposed on the primary network. It is demonstrated that the problem can be solved by convex optimization if certain practical constraints are applied. Simulation results attest that the proposed wideband spectrum sensing framework achieves superior performance compared to contemporary frameworks. An efficient iterative algorithm which solves the optimization problem with much lower complexity compared to other numerical methods is presented. It is established that the iteration-complexity and the complexity-per-iteration of the proposed algorithm increases linearly as the number of optimization variables (i.e., the number of narrowband channels) increases. The algorithm is evaluated via simulation and is shown to obtain the optimal solution very quickly and efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2096220","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/05654601.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05654601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2096220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Wideband Spectrum Sensing Framework for Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Wideband Spectrum Sensing Framework for Cognitive Radio Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654601/","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5654601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11805196","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Wideband Spectrum Sensing Framework for Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-paysarvihoseini-2096220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090526S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5654601","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5654603,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Tichavsky","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5654603/5654603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Petr Tichavsk\u00fd (M'98\u2013SM'04) received the M.S. degree in mathematics from the Czech Technical University, Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1987 and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical cybernetics from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1992.","Since that time, he has been with the Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.

It means that the number of sources exceeds the number of channels of the available data. The separation is based on the working assumption that the sources are piecewise stationary with a different variance in each block. It proceeds in two steps: 1) estimating the mixing matrix, and 2) computing the optimum beamformer in each block to maximize the signal-to-interference ratio of each separated signal with respect to the remaining signals. Estimating the mixing matrix is accomplished through a specialized tensor decomposition of the set of sample covariance matrices of the received mixture in each block. It utilizes optimum weighting, which allows statistically efficient (CRB attaining) estimation provided that the data obey the assumed Gaussian piecewise stationary model. In simulations, performance of the algorithm is successfully tested on blind separation of 16 speech signals from nine linear instantaneous mixtures of these signals.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2096221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2096221","endPage":"1047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05654603.pdf","startPage":"1037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weight Adjusted Tensor Method for Blind Separation of Underdetermined Mixtures of Nonstationary Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654603/","displayDocTitle":"Weight Adjusted Tensor Method for Blind Separation of Underdetermined Mixtures of Nonstationary Sources","volume":"59","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11805198","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5654603/","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight Adjusted Tensor Method for Blind Separation of Underdetermined Mixtures of Nonstationary Sources","sourcePdf":"tsp-tichavsky-2096221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148299S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5654603","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654610,"authors":[{"name":"Guansheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5685336/5654610/5654610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guansheng Li (S'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.","In 2010, he was an Intern with Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, where he designed wide tuning-range voltage-control oscillators (VCOs) and frequency synthesizers.

Analysis shows it achieves the same phase-noise figure-of-merit (FoM) as a single-band LC oscillator that uses the same inductor and active core. This was verified by a prototype in a 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process. It draws a current of 4 mA from a 0.5-V power supply and achieves a FoM of 194.5 dB at the 4.9-GHz band and 193.0 dB at the 6.6-GHz band, which is the same as the reference standalone LC oscillator.

Since the carrier PA with , which is the usual matching impedance for a carrier PA at a low power region, does not reach to the saturated operation at the 6-dB back-off power level, the maximum efficiency could not be achieved. However, the carrier amplifier can be driven into the saturation using the load impedance larger than and can deliver the maximum efficiency even under the knee voltage effect. The optimized design for the maximum efficiency at the back-off level is derived. The optimized amplifier is analyzed and simulated in terms of its load modulation behavior, efficiency, and output power, then compared with the conventional Doherty PA. The enhanced performance is demonstrated by the Doherty PA built using CREE's GaN HEMT CGH40045 devices at 2.655 GHz. For worldwide interoperability for microwave access applications with a 7.8-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the proposed PA delivers an efficiency of 49.3% at an output power of 42 dBm with an acceptable linearity of 23.1 dBc. The linearity is improved to 43 dBc by employing a digital feedback predistortion technique, satisfying the system linearity specification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency Enhancement of Doherty Amplifier Through Mitigation of the Knee Voltage Effect","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2091207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5685336/05654611.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2091207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency Enhancement of Doherty Amplifier Through Mitigation of the Knee Voltage Effect","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5654611/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733615","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency Enhancement of Doherty Amplifier Through Mitigation of the Knee Voltage Effect","sourcePdf":"tmtt-moon-2091207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09859S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5685336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5685336","articleId":"5654611","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654613,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d3scar Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Carlos III University in Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Madrid, Spain","Carlos III University in Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5685336/5654613/5654613-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oscar Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez was born in Madrid, Spain, on December 23, 1984.

Along this line, symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) has been reported in literature as a real-time data-driven tool of feature extraction for pattern identification from sensor time series. However, an inherent difficulty for a data-driven tool is that the quality of detection may drastically suffer in the event of sensor degradation. This paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm for condition monitoring of nuclear power plants, where symbolic feature extraction and the associated pattern classification are optimized by appropriate partitioning of (possibly noise-contaminated) sensor time series. In this process, the system anomaly signatures are identified by masking the sensor degradation signatures. The proposed anomaly detection methodology is validated on the International Reactor Innovative & Secure (IRIS) simulator of nuclear power plants, and its performance is evaluated by comparison with that of principal component analysis (PCA).","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2088138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5710484/05654618.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2088138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Power Plants via Symbolic Dynamic Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654618/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Power Plants via Symbolic Dynamic Filtering","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793839","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654618/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Nuclear Power Plants via Symbolic Dynamic Filtering","sourcePdf":"tns-ray-2088138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102599S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5710484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5710484","articleId":"5654618","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5654630,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Division, Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5688266/5654630/5654630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi Quan received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Oklahoma State University, and B.E. in Communication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

To protect the primary incumbent users from interference, the cognitive radio is required to detect incumbent signals at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we study a spectrum sensing technique based on spectral correlation for detection of television (TV) broadcasting signals. The basic strategy is to correlate the periodogram of the received signal with the a priori known spectral features of the primary signal. We show that this sensing technique is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test (LRT) at very low SNR, but with less computational complexity. That is, the spectral correlation-based detector is asymptotically optimal according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion. From the system design perspective, we analyze the effect of the spectral features on the spectrum sensing performance. Through the optimization analysis, we obtain useful insights on how to choose effective spectral features to achieve reliable sensing.

Scheduling selects groups of users according to their channels vector directions and SINR levels. However, when scheduling is applied independently in each cell, the inter-cell interference (ICI) power at each user receiver is not known in advance since it changes at each new scheduling slot depending on the scheduling decisions of all interfering base stations. In order to cope with this uncertainty, we consider the joint operation of scheduling, MU-MIMO beamforming and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). We develop a game-theoretic framework for this problem and build on stochastic optimization techniques in order to find optimal scheduling and ARQ schemes. Particularizing our framework to the case of \"outage service rates\", we obtain a scheme based on adaptive variable-rate coding at the physical layer, combined with ARQ at the Logical Link Control (ARQ-LLC). Then, we present a novel scheme based on incremental redundancy Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) that is able to achieve a throughput performance arbitrarily close to the \"genie-aided service rates\", with no need for a genie that provides non-causally the ICI power levels. The novel HARQ scheme is both easier to implement and superior in performance with respect to the conventional combination of adaptive variable-rate coding and ARQ-LLC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05654632.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.112310.100013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.112310.100013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Scheduling and ARQ for MU-MIMO Downlink in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Joints","Optimal scheduling","Automatic repeat request","Resource management","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","automatic repeat request","cellular radio","game theory","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation","radio receivers","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint scheduling decision","intercell interference","user scheduling","multiuser multiantenna transmission","high rate data oriented downlink scheme","cellular system","SINR level","user receiver","MU-MIMO beamforming","automatic repeat request","game theoretic framework","stochastic optimization technique","optimal scheduling","ARQ scheme","adaptive variable rate coding","HARQ scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","inter-cell interference","scheduling","hybrid ARQ","stochastic optimization","game theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Scheduling and ARQ for MU-MIMO Downlink in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5654632/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807433","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Scheduling and ARQ for MU-MIMO Downlink in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","sourcePdf":"578-tc1102-mehr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105695S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5654632","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654633,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Electronics Department, IT/Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Graell i Amat","id":"37085378632"},{"name":"Lars K.

The primary mathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in the context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have only been focussed on real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge, no adaptive kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, for complex valued signals. Furthermore, although the real reproducing kernels are used in an increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not, yet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications that deal with complex signals, with Communications being a typical example. In this paper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive filtering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking advantage of a technique called complexification of real RKHSs, or complex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex Gaussian kernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted attention in the signal processing community. Wirtinger's calculus simplifies computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Wirtinger's calculus is extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive several realizations of the complex kernel least-mean-square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements over several linear and nonlinear algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2096420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05654658.pdf","startPage":"964","endPage":"978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2096420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extension of Wirtinger's Calculus to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and the Complex Kernel LMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Extension of Wirtinger's Calculus to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and the Complex Kernel LMS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654658/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11805199","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654658/","volume":"59","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of Wirtinger's Calculus to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and the Complex Kernel LMS","sourcePdf":"tsp-bouboulis-2096420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084729S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5654658","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5654661,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Grossmann","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Grossmann","id":"37410512300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5654661","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Performance Analysis and Code Design for Three-Stage MMSE Turbo Equalization in Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","abstract":"This paper analyzes the outage performance of soft-cancellation frequency-domain minimum-mean-square error (SC FD-MMSE) turbo equalization in a serially concatenated coded modulation scheme over frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels with exponential delay-power profile. The convergence behavior of this iterative three-stage system is evaluated with the aid of correlation charts. Based on the convergence characteristic of the equalizer and the inner and outer channel decoders, we derive a simple closed-form approximation on the outage probability of the turbo receiver. In particular, using a union-bounding technique and a specific central limit theorem, it is shown that the outage probability can be well approximated by a sum of complementary Gaussian error functions. A design criterion based on the resultant analytical expression is then proposed to construct outer encoders that minimize the outage probability of three-stage turbo systems employing irregular recursive convolutional (IRC) codes. We provide examples of optimized IRC-based outer encoders and investigate by simulation the performance improvement obtained by optimized IRC-coded turbo equalization over turbo equalization using regular recursive convolutional codes. Numerical results of outage performance simulations in channels with different delay-power profiles are presented to verify the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2096440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"473","endPage":"484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2096440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05654661.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Equalizers","Decoding","Convergence","Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency selective surfaces","Gaussian processes","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","Rayleigh channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage performance analysis","code design","three-stage MMSE turbo equalization","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","soft-cancellation frequency-domain minimum-mean-square error","iterative three-stage system","turbo receiver","complementary Gaussian error functions","irregular recursive convolutional codes","IRC-coded turbo equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation analysis","minimum mean-square error (MMSE) turbo equalization","outage analysis","union bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage Performance Analysis and Code Design for Three-Stage MMSE Turbo Equalization in Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654661/","volume":"60","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11807408","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Performance Analysis and Code Design for Three-Stage MMSE Turbo Equalization in Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-grossmann-2096440-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088235S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5654661","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5654663,"authors":[{"name":"Keith A.

The core supports two distinct error-detection designs, allowing a direct comparison of the relative trade-offs. The first design embeds error-detection sequential (EDS) circuits in critical paths to detect late timing transitions. In addition to reducing the Fclk guardbands for dynamic variations, the embedded EDS design can exploit path-activation rates to operate the microprocessor faster than infrequently-activated critical paths. The second error-detection design offers a less-intrusive approach for dynamic timing-error detection by placing a tunable replica circuit (TRC) per pipeline stage to monitor worst-case delays. Although the TRCs require a delay guardband to ensure the TRC delay is always slower than critical-path delays, the TRC design captures most of the benefits from the embedded EDS design with less implementation overhead. Furthermore, while core min-delay constraints limit the potential benefits of the embedded EDS design, a salient advantage of the TRC design is the ability to detect a wider range of dynamic delay variation, as demonstrated through low supply voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CC</sub>\n) measurements.

While several proposals aim at quite idealistic conditions, our approach intentionally employs low-cost microphones. Moreover, we assume the microphone array to be integrated into the head-unit of the car. Although from an acoustical perspective this is not an ideal location, it is yet very attractive since it omits further wiring and offers a compact and optimized solution. To achieve the required level of directivity and noise reduction in car noise, the a priori noise field of diffuse noise is exploited. A new postfilter estimation using an adaptive smoothing factor along with an estimation quality indicator is proposed which is well suited for low-cost microphones. Meanwhile, an intrusive instrumental evaluation methodology will be introduced. We will show that a significant level of noise attenuation can be achieved, while the quality of the speech component will be improved compared to the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2010.5654668","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2010.5654668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522687","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5510864/5522687/05654668.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A post-filter for wideband speech beamforming in automotive application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654668/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A post-filter for wideband speech beamforming in automotive application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A post-filter for wideband speech beamforming in automotive application","confLoc":"Braunschweig, Germany","sourcePdf":"15957_ADD-A Post-Filter...10-19-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067452S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5510864","isNumber":"5522687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5510864","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5522687","articleId":"5654668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5654690,"authors":[{"name":"Xuesong Chen","affiliation":["Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596808200"},{"name":"Mingyu Han","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Information Engineering, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Han","id":"37591472700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5654690","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Covariance matrix","MIMO","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fuzzy set theory","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind channel estimation algorithm","MIMO systems","orthogonal coded multiple-input multiple-output systems","mathematical model","orthogonal space-time codes","channel impulse response","fuzzy channel elimination","pilot signal","transmitter","estimation error","transmission bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semiblind channel estimation","orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs)","multiple-input multiple-output"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a very efficient semi blind algorithm for orthogonally coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed.

The obtained simulation results for the AWGN channel demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant bit error rate performance and appears to be suitable for CDMA based MIMO-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/ISVC.2010.5654881","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637455/5654712/05654881.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVC.2010.5654881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy ICA-based detection method for compound system MIMO-OFDM in CDMA context","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654881/","displayDocTitle":"Noisy ICA-based detection method for compound system MIMO-OFDM in CDMA context","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678995","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5654881/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy ICA-based detection method for compound system MIMO-OFDM in CDMA context","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062281S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637455","isNumber":"5654712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637455","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654712","articleId":"5654881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5654952,"authors":[{"name":"Justin L.

An optimum system that fulfills the requirements of standoff detection must be portable, low cost, and have a high probability of detection with low probability of false alarm at a distance of at least 20 meters. Currently there are a variety of modalities being researched to perform standoff detection of PBIED's including: backscatter X-ray imaging, infrared imaging, optical detection, terahertz imaging, video analytics, and millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging. MMW imaging at 94 GHz is a very good modality for performing standoff detection of PBIEDs. MMWs can propagate through the atmosphere and clothing with very little attenuation, while at the same time do not cause damage to human skin tissue. A mono-static linear frequency modulated continuous wave (LFMCW) circular inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) system has been developed and tested. A model of such a system using a two dimensional full wave analysis based on the finite difference method in the frequency domain has been developed and compared with results of the experimental system. Using a two dimensional matched filtering technique in the frequency domain, simulated images have been used as a means of performing target detection and classification. The imaging results of both simulated and experimentally obtained data is presented in this paper. Initial results using the 2D matched filtering target classification technique will also be presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2010.5654952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654927","startPage":"428","endPage":"434","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5635421/5654927/05654952.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of experimental and modeled results of an active millimeter wave inverse synthetic aperture radar system used to perform standoff detection of person-borne improvised explosive devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5654952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5654952/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of experimental and modeled results of an active millimeter wave inverse synthetic aperture radar system used to perform standoff detection of person-borne improvised explosive devices","conferenceDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679236","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of experimental and modeled results of an active millimeter wave inverse synthetic aperture radar system used to perform standoff detection of person-borne improvised explosive devices","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"079066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054738S","chronDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5635421","isNumber":"5654927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5635421","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5654927","articleId":"5654952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5654969,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred Tsz Yin Lok","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alfred Tsz Yin","lastName":"Lok","id":"37399204000"},{"name":"Zekeriya Aliyazicioglu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zekeriya","lastName":"Aliyazicioglu","id":"37399201200"},{"name":"H.

The estimated autocorrelation and cross correlation matrices in this study are based on a combination of temporal averaging and spatial smoothing method. Two different methods of estimating the multi-signal DOA are: (1) Choice of appropriate pairs of generalized eigenvalues from the two sub-arrays according to their relative distance from the unit circle, and (2) Choice of appropriate pairs of generalized eigenvalues from the two sub-arrays according to their Euclidean distances [1]. Since the performance of the second approach provides a better estimation, it is used in this simulation study. A 19-element array antenna is used in this simulation study.

The paper carries out simulation experiments on moving time, moving speed of the anchor, iterative times respectively, and the result shows that the proposed algorithm has strong expanded ability, low computing complexity, and can significantly reduce the localization error and the number of anchor nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655005/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11678750","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655005/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Localization algorithm for mobile anchor node based on genetic algorithm in wireless sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization algorithm for mobile anchor node based on genetic algorithm in wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"001137d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054277S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5643978","isNumber":"5654716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5643978","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5654716","articleId":"5655005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5655006,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085396605"},{"name":"Huadong Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Meng","id":"37276216000"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280791300"},{"name":"Xiqin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655006","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Trajectory","Delay","Clutter","Noise measurement","Joints","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","probability","state estimation","target tracking","time-varying filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GMPHD tracker","delayed decision","Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density","time-varying number","target state estimation","Gaussian mixture component","GMPHD filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GMPHD Tracker","Delayed Decision","pruning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655006","abstract":"The Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GMPHD) filter was proposed to estimate the time-varying number of targets and their states, and GMPHD tracker even gives the identities of individual target state estimates, by recording the evolution of each Gaussian mixture component based GMPHD filter.

Based on the trained neural networks, three watermarking results can be extracted and then are voted to decide the final watermark.

However it is not robust to noise and as a consequence, the performance of direction-of-arrival algorithms is often degraded under low signal-to-noise condition. We propose to address this problem through the use of a wavelet-based speech enhancement technique since the wavelet transform can achieve good denoising performance. The over complete rational-dilation wavelet transform is then exploited to effectively process speech signals due to its higher frequency resolution. In addition, we exploit the joint distribution of the speech in the wavelet domain and develop a novel local noise variance estimator based on the bivariate shrinkage function. As will be shown, our proposed algorithm achieves good direction-of-arrival performance in the presence of noise.","doi":"10.1109/CW.2010.69","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Cyberworlds","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Cyberworlds","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654666/5654996/05655062.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2010.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Speech Source Localization in Noisy Environment Using Overcomplete Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655062/","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Speech Source Localization in Noisy Environment Using Overcomplete Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688424","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655062/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Speech Source Localization in Noisy Environment Using Overcomplete Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4215a077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047469S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654666","isNumber":"5654996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654666","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654996","articleId":"5655062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5655064,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Daniel","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Daniel","id":"37541723600"},{"name":"Sebastian Rohde","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Rohde","id":"37548008700"},{"name":"Christian Wietfeld","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute (CNI), Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wietfeld","id":"37353607200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6048-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6047-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6046-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655064","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1010},"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) enable the in-depth reconnaissance and surveillance of major incidents. Uncontrolled emissions of liquid or gaseous contaminants in cases of volcanic eruptions, large fires, industrial incidents or terrorist attacks can be analyzed by utilizing UAVs. Hence, the use of cognitive Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for distributing mobile sensors in incident areas is in general a significant value add for remote sensing, reconnaissance, surveillance and communication purposes. Police departments, fire brigades and other homeland security organizations will have access to medium and small size UAVs in the near future and will integrate UAVs in their work flow. In this paper we are focusing on the civilian concepts of operations (CONOPS) for UAVs, in particular for small-scale UAVs. We present viable concepts on system level for leveraging public wireless communication networks for UAV-based sensor networks with respect to existing constraints and user requirements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Organizations","Terrorism","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Routing protocols","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft control","mobile robots","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public wireless communication infrastructures","sensor network","unmanned aerial vehicles","liquid contaminant","gaseous contaminant","volcanic eruptions","fires","industrial incidents","terrorist attacks","cognitive unmanned aerial system","mobile sensor","remote sensing purpose","reconnaissance purpose","surveillance purpose","communication purpose","police departments","fire brigades","homeland security organization","public wireless communication network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","Airborne Communication","Communication-Aware Mobility","Unmanned Aerial Systems","Cognitive Sensor Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/THS.2010.5655064","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5635421/5654927/05655064.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2010.5655064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging public wireless communication infrastructures for UAV-based sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging public wireless communication infrastructures for UAV-based sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655064/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655064/","accessionNumber":"11679253","conferenceDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging public wireless communication infrastructures for UAV-based sensor networks","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"035090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059386S","chronDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5635421","isNumber":"5654927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5635421","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5654927","articleId":"5655064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5655086,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaping Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Jiaping","lastName":"Liang","id":"37600417100"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Kon Max Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Kon Max","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655086","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Wireless communication","Cooperative systems","Signal to noise ratio","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","power amplifiers","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4-QAM relay amplification","amplify-and-forward","half-duplex cooperative wireless system","error probability","signal-to-noise ratio","power amplification"]}],"abstract":"We consider an amplify-and-forward half-duplex co-operative wireless system.

Risks range from the increased unreliability of counterfeits to data exfiltration and adversary control enabled by hardware Trojan horses embedded in chips. Risks are different for military vs. non-military Government vs. civilian organizations. We cite cases that underscore the reality of supply chain risk, and analyze the structure of supply chains that affect different part of the market for IT electronics, in order to provide a better understanding of attack methods. We discuss techniques for defending against the range of threats, and propose a practical solution based on a suite of simple, inexpensive test procedures that could be used to build an \"80% solution\" for detection of counterfeits and embedded malicious implants before they are deployed. Tests we have prototyped include power signatures and of IR thermographic signatures of boot events. Deployment of such a test suite would change the SCRM game by making it significantly more difficult for supply chain exploits to succeed.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2010.5655094","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5635421/5654927/05655094.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2010.5655094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supply chain risk mitigation for IT electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Supply chain risk mitigation for IT electronics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679223","htmlLink":"/document/5655094/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supply chain risk mitigation for IT electronics","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"014148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041902S","chronDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5635421","isNumber":"5654927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5635421","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5654927","articleId":"5655094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5655124,"authors":[{"name":"Rongbo Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599473800"},{"name":"Chaohuan Hou","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaohuan","lastName":"Hou","id":"37275551000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655124","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","blind source separation","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming method","cyclostationary signals","blind beamforming","blind separation","ATH3","cyclic correlation functions","blind adaptive beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["array signal","blind adaptive beamforming","cyclostationary","cyclic frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655124","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655124","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","abstract":"Blind beamforming, which consists of recovering signals only from observed instantaneous linear mixtures without a priori information about array manifold, is an important problem in many practical applications including radar, sonar, wireless communication and so on.

An interesting current research topic in MIMO radar is the frequency diversity MIMO (f-MIMO) radar. The frequency between two adjacent transmitted signals of f-MIMO radar are not identical but stepped uniformly at the same time. In this paper, a f-MIMO radar array processing model is developed. It is shown that the f-MIMO radar array processing can form a range-dimension beam, so it has the ability to distinguish targets in different ranges. The range resolution of array processing is derived, and then, the virtual array aperture of f-MIMO radar is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655139","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655139.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of frequency diversity MIMO radar beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655139/","displayDocTitle":"A study of frequency diversity MIMO radar beamforming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655139/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of frequency diversity MIMO radar beamforming","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"089si0553d2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082681S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5655148,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yongchun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Yongchun","id":"37602666000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655148","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655148","abstract":"An Elman neural network with a weather component is proposed for the power load forecasting.

This approach is used to design a rational discrete wavelet transform with dilation factor of 3/2 and satisfies a shift invariant property approximately. The rational filter bank design problem is transformed to an equivalent uniform M-channel filter bank design. The perfect reconstruction (PR) condition gives rise to a set of non-linear conditions between the synthesis and analysis filter coeficients while regularity gives rise to a set of linear constraints. The design problem is solved using a constrained nonlinear optimisation program in which the PR and regularity are the constraints to an objective function defined as sum of the squared of the difference between the magnitude responses of the designed analysis/synthesis filters and the ideal brick-wall responses. The optimisation program used for the design is a simple linear-search built-in program in Matlab. The obtained filter bank designs show excellent frequency selectivity and their iterations are approximately shift invariant.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655165","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","startPage":"199","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critically sampled discrete wavelet transforms with rational dilation factor of 3/2","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Critically sampled discrete wavelet transforms with rational dilation factor of 3/2","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655165/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687248","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5655165/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critically sampled discrete wavelet transforms with rational dilation factor of 3/2","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"051sf0334d4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052176S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5655177,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Bahoura","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Quebec, Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Bahoura","id":"37267277600"},{"name":"Hassan Ezzaidi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Sciences, University of Quebec, Chicoutimi, Chicoutimi, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Ezzaidi","id":"37395174100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655177","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time implementation of discrete wavelet transform on FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655177.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655177","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time implementation","discrete wavelet transform","FPGA","real-time architecture","forward/inverse wavelet transforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655177","abstract":"This paper presents a real-time architecture for forward/inverse wavelet transforms that take into account the group delays of the used filters.

In some applications, the detection of LFM signals and estimation of time-delay are very important. It needs very high sampling rate to address the problems for UWB LFM signal under Nyquist sampling theory which exceeds the current ADC capacity. In this paper, we propose a Compressive Sensing (CS) based method to solve the problem with ultra low sampling rate. We adopt an FrFt based sparse dictionary for CS because of the energy concentration property of LFM signal in the fractional Fourier domain. The performance is much better than the already existed method which used signal-matched sparse dictionary in noise condition. Experiments based on simulated data are carried out to testify the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655221.pdf","startPage":"2435","endPage":"2438","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB LFM echo signal detection and time-delay estimation based on compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Fourier transforms","Compressed sensing","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","echo","Fourier analysis","frequency modulation","signal detection","signal sampling","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB","LFM","echo signal detection","time delay estimation","compressive sensing","linear frequency modulation","Nyquist sampling theory","fractional Fourier domain","FrFt"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LFM","FrFt","Basis Pursuit","Compressive Sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"UWB LFM echo signal detection and time-delay estimation based on compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687550","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB LFM echo signal detection and time-delay estimation based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"625si0307d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083159S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5655238,"authors":[{"name":"Anup Ghosh","affiliation":["Invincea, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["Anup Ghosh is founder and chief scientist of lnvincea, a venture-backed security company developing next generation Internet security products to protect desktops and computer networks.

The Prioritized Frame Selection based CDMA MAC protocol (PFSC-MAC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n) incorporates not only the value, but also the variation trend of the receiving power of the beacon signals. This protocol provides a low rate of failed packet due to the mobility of the UAV, which is the most critical metric in these types of applications. In addition, an optimal number of priority groups have also been introduced to guarantee a minimal transmission interval and a lowest failed packet ratio. Numerical results have also shown the efficient energy compared with the other protocol that is based on TDMA. This protocol is simple but promising for various applications that collect data from a large area sensor network.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2010.5655304","publicationTitle":"29th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"29th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640098/5655296/05655304.pdf","startPage":"5.C.5-1","endPage":"5.C.5-8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2010.5655304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel multiple access scheme for wireless sensor network employing unmanned aerial vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel multiple access scheme for wireless sensor network employing unmanned aerial vehicle","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11721809","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655304/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel multiple access scheme for wireless sensor network employing unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"5c5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125925S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640098","isNumber":"5655296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640098","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5655296","articleId":"5655304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5655350,"authors":[{"name":"Jinzhu Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure Design of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jinzhu Zhou","id":"37596875900"},{"name":"Jin Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure Design of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jin Huang","id":"37600876300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6837-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6834-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6836-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655350","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"In order to obtain an accurate regression model from a small dataset, a novel linear program support vector regression with priori knowledge is presented in the paper.

The traditional way to define diversity only considers the inner structure of networks.

This paper proposed a method to find diversity from the output error curves of neural networks, it only pays attention to output error curve and thus avoids involving inner structure of neural networks. We apply this method on several dataset including UCI dataset and a practical industrial dataset. The results indicate the effectiveness of this method. This method can be extended to not only neural network ensemble but also multiple-model ensemble which provides new thoughts for the development of neural network ensemble.","doi":"10.1109/ICISS.2010.5655353","startPage":"587","endPage":"590","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Integrated Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5643978/5654716/05655353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Integrated Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISS.2010.5655353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network ensemble method with new definition of diversity based on output error curve","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","error analysis","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output error curve","neural network structure","UCI dataset","multiple model ensemble","network structure diversity","black box"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network ensemble","Selective ensemble","Diversity","Output error curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A neural network ensemble method with new definition of diversity based on output error curve","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687939","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network ensemble method with new definition of diversity based on output error curve","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"014889d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04695S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5643978","isNumber":"5654716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5643978","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654716","articleId":"5655353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5655356,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599727500"},{"name":"Zhenjiang Miao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhenjiang","lastName":"Miao","id":"37301623700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655356","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":827},"abstract":"Anomaly detection in crowd scene is very important because of more concern with people safety in public place. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect abnormal behavior in crowd scene. For this purpose, instead of tracking every person, KLT corners are extracted as feature points to represent moving objects and tracked by optical flow technique to generate motion vectors, which are used to describe motion. We divide whole frame into small blocks, and motion pattern in each block is encoded by the distribution of motion vectors in it. Similar motion patterns are clustered into pattern model in an unsupervised way, and we classify motion pattern into normal or abnormal group according to the deviation between motion pattern and trained model. The results on abnormal events detection in real video demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655356.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1223","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in crowd scene","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cameras","Databases","Adaptive optics","Tracking","Hidden Markov models","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image motion analysis","image sequences","object tracking","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","crowd scene","abnormal behavior detection","KLT corners","feature extraction","moving object represention","optical flow technique","motion vector generation","motion pattern","motion vector distribution","motion pattern model","abnormal events detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Crowd scene","KLT corner","Optical flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in crowd scene","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687603","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in crowd scene","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"318si0359d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05152S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5655375,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine Morlet","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Morlet","id":"37444599300"},{"name":"F.

It facilitates on systematic use of models from a very early phase of the design process and through various model transformation steps (semi-)automatically generates source code and documentation. However, on one hand, the use of model-driven approaches for the development of configuration data is not as widely used as for source code synthesis. On the other hand, we believe that, particular systems that make heavy use of configuration tables like the ARINC 653 standard can benefit from model-driven design by (i) automating error-prone configuration file editing and (ii) using model based validation for early error detection. In this paper, we will present the results of the European project DIANA that investigated the use of MDD in the context of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) and the ARINC 653 standard. In the scope of the project, a tool chain was implemented that generates ARINC 653 configuration tables from high-level architecture models. The tool chain was integrated with different target systems (VxWorks 653, SIMA) and evaluated during case studies with real-world and real-sized avionics applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Biological system modeling","Data models","Documentation","Atmospheric modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DASC.2010.5655451","publicationTitle":"29th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"29th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640098/5655296/05655451.pdf","startPage":"6.E.3-1","endPage":"6.E.3-15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2010.5655451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven development of ARINC 653 configuration tables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven development of ARINC 653 configuration tables","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655451/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655451/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven development of ARINC 653 configuration tables","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"6e3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121941S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640098","isNumber":"5655296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640098","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5655296","articleId":"5655451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5655567,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Wieczorek","affiliation":["SAP Research, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Wieczorek","id":"37078200800"},{"name":"Alin Stefanescu","affiliation":["SAP Research, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Stefanescu","id":"37393733200"},{"name":"Andreas Roth","affiliation":["SAP Research, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Roth","id":"37392518500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8539-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4241-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"This paper presents a case study for the modeling and model-based testing (MBT) of enterprise service choreographies.

The SINR is very significant parameters for evaluation of the performance in a wireless network. Different users have different SINR requirement, so it is very important that the SINR of a particular user is within a certain acceptable range. The calculated SINR is more precise by considering the uplink and down link frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2010.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654667/5655294/05655592.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2010.28","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","startPage":"440","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cognitive Radio with Emphasis on Uplink and Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Cognitive Radio with Emphasis on Uplink and Downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655592/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655592/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679352","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Cognitive Radio with Emphasis on Uplink and Downlink","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055376S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5655592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5655642,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597491400"},{"name":"Xinshun Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xinshun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37595307700"},{"name":"Liang Peng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37589639500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655642","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655642","abstract":"Recently, it has been shown that, in ensemble learning, it may be preferable to ensemble some instead of all the classifiers. Various selective ensemble approaches are then designed, where optimization algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA) are used to evolve weights of component classifiers and classifiers with weights greater than a threshold are selected. This paper proposes a novel selective ensemble algorithm which treats each ensemble as a multiset defined over the universe of all the trained classifiers and directly optimizes the ensemble set. Firstly, a classifiers pool U is trained, and a candidate multiset ensemble d is initialized to U. Then GA is employed to evolve the candidate ensemble d. The underlying set of the final optimal ensemble contains the component classifiers that GA has selected and the multiplicities of the classifiers form different \"confidence\" levels in correct prediction. More trust can then be put on classifiers with higher confidence levels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves much preferable performance to several state-of-the-art selective and non-selective ensemble algorithms while generating ensembles with far smaller size.","doi":"10.1109/AICI.2010.91","startPage":"403","endPage":"407","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654674/5654767/05655642.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Based Selective Ensemble with Multiset Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Accuracy","Bagging","Gallium","Training","Prediction algorithms","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","selective ensemble","multiset representation","ensemble learning","optimization algorithms","component classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["selective ensemble","genetic algorithm","multiset","diversity measures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Based Selective Ensemble with Multiset Representation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5655642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690320","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm Based Selective Ensemble with Multiset Representation","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4225a403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050507S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654674","isNumber":"5654767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654674","xplore-issue":"5654767","articleId":"5655642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5655757,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598328500"},{"name":"Zijing Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zijing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279626800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655757","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Simulation","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Radar","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","interference suppression","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","orthogonal vector","interference polarization","null phase-shifting polarization filter","linear polarization-vector translation","amplitude compensation","phase compensation","weighted combination polarization filter","interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarization filter","weighted combination","interference suppression","polarization estimation"]}],"abstract":"Conventional polarization filters can mitigate an interference by using the orthogonal vector of the interference polarization, but leading to distortion of the target signal in its amplitude and phase. A null phase-shifting polarization filter can reconstruct the original target signal. However, it needs some complex operations, such as a linear polarization-vector translation and compensations in amplitude and phase. In this paper, a weighted combination polarization filter is proposed, which retains the original target signal while suppressing the interference within one step. The simulation results show that the new filter is an effective means to remove the interference in the polarization domain.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655757","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new polarization filter based on weighted combination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new polarization filter based on weighted combination","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655757/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687613","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new polarization filter based on weighted combination","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"558si0903d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070483S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5655819,"authors":[{"name":"Awatif Rouijel","affiliation":["GSCM-LRIT laboratory Faculty of Science, University Mohamed V, Morocco"],"firstName":"Awatif","lastName":"Rouijel","id":"37586406800"},{"name":"Benayad Nsiri","affiliation":["LIAD laboratory Faculty of Sciences, University Hassan II, Ain Chock, Morocco"],"firstName":"Benayad","lastName":"Nsiri","id":"37298684300"},{"name":"Mohammed Et Tolba","affiliation":["SC Department, Telecom Bretagne CNRS (UMR 3192), Technopole Brest-Iroise, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Mohammed Et","lastName":"Tolba","id":"37605514800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5998-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5996-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5997-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5655819","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"Efficiency and adaptivity play a major role in the design of fourth-generation wireless systems (4G).

This paper proposes a sort of Sub-Nyquist Sampling-Based Method for Jamming ISAR Systems. First introduces the deception jamming technique based on false target for ISAR. Then investigates the jamming principle of sub-Nyquist sampling modulation.

However, it is a challenge to synthesize large bandwidth for OFDM phase-coded pulse since wide instantaneous bandwidth and high sampling rate requirements. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new radar signal called OFDM phase-coded stepped-frequency (OFDM-PCSF) signal, of which the pulse train is stepped frequency, and each pulse is implemented with OFDM phase-coded chips. The property of OFDM-PCSF signal is analyzed at first. And then, the mathematical expressions of the high resolution range profiles (HRRP) are derived, assuming an elementary scenario of point-scattering targets. It mainly presents the influence of velocity on HRRP and investigates the parameter design and velocity compensation, which is helpful for the realization of OFDM imaging radar. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the validity of the conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655889","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","startPage":"1994","endPage":"1998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The principle of synthesizing HRRP based on a new OFDM phase-coded stepped-frequency radar signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The principle of synthesizing HRRP based on a new OFDM phase-coded stepped-frequency radar signal","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655889/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687359","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5655889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The principle of synthesizing HRRP based on a new OFDM phase-coded stepped-frequency radar signal","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"512si0311d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067209S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5655891,"authors":[{"name":"Kim Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Imaging Technology and System, Ministry of Education of China School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Gao","id":"37528848300"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Imaging Technology and System, Ministry of Education of China School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310454900"},{"name":"Ying-hui Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Imaging Technology and System, Ministry of Education of China School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying-hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598234100"},{"name":"Xiao-mei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Imaging Technology and System, Ministry of Education of China School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-mei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596811400"},{"name":"Guo-qiang Ni","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Imaging Technology and System, Ministry of Education of China School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guo-qiang","lastName":"Ni","id":"37542830500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655891","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655891","abstract":"During spatial remote sensing imaging procedure, combined degradation factors conduce to Gaussian image blurring. The precondition of restoring the degraded image is to estimate point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system as precisely as possible. Because the depredating processes are quite complex, the transfer function of the degraded system is often completely or partly unknown, which makes it quite difficult to identify the precise PSF. Considering the similarity between the quantum process and imaging process in the probability and statistics fields, a novel algorithm is proposed by using multilayer feed-forward back-propagation quantum neural network (QBPNN) to estimate PSF of the Gaussian degraded imaging system. Different from the classical artificial neural network (ANN), 2 adjustable parameters of weight connection coefficient and phase coefficient are introduced in its quantum neurons used in learning stage. By establishing different training sets, this estimation method can overcome the limitation in the dependence on initial values and large amount of computation. Test results show that this method can achieve higher precision, faster convergence and stronger generalization ability comparing with the traditional PSF estimation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655891","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655891.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSF estimation for Gaussian image blur using back-propagation quantum neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Estimation","Artificial neural networks","Imaging","Training","Image restoration","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","estimation theory","Gaussian processes","geophysical image processing","image restoration","multilayer perceptrons","optical transfer function","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSF estimation","spatial remote sensing imaging","Gaussian image blurring","image restoration","point spread function estimation","multilayer feedforward backpropagation quantum neural network","QBPNN","quantum neuron","weight connection coefficient","phase coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Point Spread Function (PSF)","Quantum Neural Network (QNN)","Guassian blur","spatial remote sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"PSF estimation for Gaussian image blur using back-propagation quantum neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655891/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687355","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSF estimation for Gaussian image blur using back-propagation quantum neural network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"280si0174d2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066455S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5655897,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Hao","affiliation":["EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Hao","id":"37547971900"},{"name":"He Xuezhi","affiliation":["EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Xuezhi","id":"37602652800"},{"name":"Yin Zhiping","affiliation":["EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Zhiping","id":"37545589700"},{"name":"Wang Dongjin","affiliation":["EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Dongjin","id":"37300721000"},{"name":"Chen Weidong","affiliation":["EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Weidong","id":"37301613000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655897","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Radar imaging","Image reconstruction","MIMO radar","Scattering","FCC","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","MIMO radar","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","MIMO radar imaging","inverse scattering model","space intersection","image resolution","imaging quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar imaging","compressive sensing"]}],"abstract":"From the view of inverse scattering imaging, the paper gives basic principle of MIMO radar imaging, then applies compressive sensing (CS) to two methods.

Then, general CRB expressions are derived for a narrowband signals with the above signal and noise models. We find that the directional parameters are uncoupled with Doppler shift for the space-time separable signal and noise models. However, the directional parameters are usually coupled with each other, i.e., the direction-of-departure (DOD) with direction-of-arrival (DOA) and the azimuth angles the elevation angles are ordinarily coupled. Fortunately, the uncoupled direction estimation can be gotten by the specifical antennas placement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05655917.pdf","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2146","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5655917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5655917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds for estimating velocity and direction with a bistatic MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","MIMO radar","Radar antennas","Receiving antennas","Estimation","Transmitting antennas","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","Doppler radar","Doppler shift","MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds","velocity estimation","direction estimation","bistatic MIMO radar","Doppler shift","bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar","narrowband signals","space-time separable signal model","noise model","direction-of-departure","direction-of-arrival","antennas placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Radar","space-time separability","Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound (CRB)","direction estimation","velocity estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5655917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds for estimating velocity and direction with a bistatic MIMO radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5655917/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687321","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds for estimating velocity and direction with a bistatic MIMO radar","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"553asi0686d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054877S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5655917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5655935,"authors":[{"name":"Xie Xiao-Chun","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China","Center of Space Science and Applied Research, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xie","lastName":"Xiao-Chun","id":"38276853000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5655935","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Radar cross section","Three dimensional displays","Imaging","Correlation","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse compression","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing technique","data rate","phase reservation CS based pulse compression algorithm","radar signal sparsity property","3D radar imaging algorithm","phase information","CS range compression","2D radar imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar imaging","compressive sensing","phase-reservation","InlSAR"]}],"abstract":"By using compressive sensing technique, the data rate needed in radar imaging can be remarkably reduced.

In general, channel decoding methods can achieve better performance if they are combined with soft-output SD rather than hard-output one. Unfortunately, not all soft-output values can be obtained in SD. Although several constants could be substituted for these unavailable values, it needs trial and error. Thus, in this paper, we propose novel algorithms to solve such a problem. Based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed scheme has good performance and lower complexity, as compared to other reference approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656126.pdf","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2628","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-output sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Phase shift keying","Computational complexity","AWGN","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-output sphere decoding","MIMO system","MIMO receiver","maximum-likelihood detection","MLD algorithm","channel decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO system","data detection","sorted QR decomposition","sphere decoding","soft demapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Soft-output sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656126/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687315","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-output sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"689sf0926gd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.332561S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5656132,"authors":[{"name":"Himan Khanzadi","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Himan","lastName":"Khanzadi","id":"37590911500"},{"name":"Mojtaba Amini Omam","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba Amini","lastName":"Omam","id":"37590912000"},{"name":"Foad Lotfifar","affiliation":["Electronic Research Center, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Foad","lastName":"Lotfifar","id":"37302979400"},{"name":"Mohammad Eshghi","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Eshghi","id":"37286011000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656132","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image encryption based on gyrator transform using chaotic maps","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an algorithm for image encryption using chaotic maps and gyrator transform.

Later, the bits of each plane are substituted according to random bit matrix that is the products of chaotic maps. The proposed method produces encrypted image whose performance is evaluated by chi-square test, correlation coefficient, Number Pixel of Change Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). Based on the fact that continuous form of gyrator transform has very high computational load, then a discrete form of gyrator transform is formulated for achieving better results that is widely used in optical systems. The computational overhead is highly reduced in this formulation by employing Fast Fourier transform.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656132.pdf","startPage":"2608","endPage":"2612","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656132","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656132","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656132","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Gyrators","Encryption","Pixel","Correlation","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","cryptography","fast Fourier transforms","image coding","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image encryption","gyrator transform","chaotic maps","chaotic logistic","tent maps","random bit sequence","random bit matrix","chi square test","correlation coefficient","number pixel of change rate","unified average changing intensity","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gyrator transform","chaoticmap","substitution","random bit sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656132/","displayDocTitle":"Image encryption based on gyrator transform using chaotic maps","accessionNumber":"11687457","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656132/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image encryption based on gyrator transform using chaotic maps","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"685sf0444dgjian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039444S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656134,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Gholami-Boroujeny","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shiva","lastName":"Gholami-Boroujeny","id":"38277784200"},{"name":"Mohammad Eshghi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Eshghi","id":"37286011000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656134","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Genetics","Adaptive systems","Noise measurement","Distortion measurement","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","adaptive signal processing","genetic algorithms","nonlinear filters","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive noise cancellation","genetic optimization","genetic algorithms","nonlinear filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive noise cancellation","nonlinear filter","genetic optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656134","abstract":"In this paper, the use of the genetic algorithm in optimization of a nonlinear filter in adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) system is proposed.

Recent works based on space domain decomposition use Delaunay tessellation according to the image content (1). The proposed decomposition gives a set of strongly correlated blocks with various sizes. To reach this goal we perform image decomposition using the Quadtree technique. The decomposition is based on statistical content analysis by using the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT). The transform computes the energy concentrated on first eigenvectors to fix blocks homogeneity. The generated grid of blocks must be stable and must resist to a large number of image processing algorithms (2). The number of bits inserted in each bloc depends on bloc dimensions. In fact, largest blocks can contain more than one bit, one bit by layer, as proposed by CDMA approach (3). Besides, our approach uses a scalar coefficient, because of blocks homogeneity, to perform the psycho-visual watermark weighting and avoid computing this coefficient locally for each pixel, which is very time consuming.","doi":"10.1109/ISVC.2010.5656227","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637455/5654712/05656227.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVC.2010.5656227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content based image watermarking using multi-level decomposition and CDMA technique","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","image coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","quadtrees","statistical analysis","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA technique","multi-level decomposition","image watermarking","image processing","space domain decomposition","Delaunay tessellation","quadtree technique","statistical content analysis","Karhunen-Loeve transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Karhunen Loeve Transfer","Quadtree","CDMA","watermarking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","displayDocTitle":"Content based image watermarking using multi-level decomposition and CDMA technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656227/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content based image watermarking using multi-level decomposition and CDMA technique","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050679S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637455","isNumber":"5654712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637455","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654712","articleId":"5656227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5656246,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Indeed, audio signals and, in particular, musical signals can be well approximated by a sum of damped sinusoidal (modal) components. Based on this representation, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) for audio mixture signal. By applying PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to the extracted components, we find uncorrelated components which are the artificial observations. Then we obtain independent components by applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to the uncorrelated components.

First, wideband orthogonal signals are sent out by transmitting sensors and the output of receiving sensors is decomposed into several narrow frequency bands using FFT. The covariance matrix of receiving signals can be expressed as the superposition of the covariance matrices of different frequency bands by exploiting the orthogonal relation of frequency components of the wideband signals. Next, narrowband MIMO method is used to produce the spatial spectrum of every frequency band. Finally, spatial spectrums of all frequency bands are averaged to get source DOAs.

The design proposes novel Arithmetic Table Elimination (ATE) techniques, along with a table compression technique applied to those tables that cannot be eliminated by arithmetic manipulations. These approaches allows to halve the total number of tables requested by CAVLC algorithm and bring to an overall memory saving of about 87% with respect to an unoptimized implementation of the tables. Computational performances of the encoder have been improved by increasing the degree of parallelism through the use of priority cascading logic. With the proposed approaches the CAVLC encoder is capable of real time compression of 1080p HDTV video streams, coded in YCbCr 4:2:0, when it is implemented with a low-end Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA, where the encoder achieves an operation frequency of 63MHz and requires an area occupancy of 2200 LUTs.","doi":"10.1109/ISVC.2010.5656302","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium On I/V Communications and Mobile Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637455/5654712/05656302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVC.2010.5656302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654712","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area reduced design of the Context-Adaptive Variable-Length encoder suitable for embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An area reduced design of the Context-Adaptive Variable-Length encoder suitable for embedded systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656302/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687996","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656302/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area reduced design of the Context-Adaptive Variable-Length encoder suitable for embedded systems","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044773S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 2 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637455","isNumber":"5654712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637455","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5654712","articleId":"5656302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5656326,"authors":[{"name":"Zulfiqar Ali","affiliation":["Irtiqa Technologies, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Zulfiqar","lastName":"Ali","id":"37587684200"},{"name":"Ali Arshad","affiliation":["Irtiqa Technologies, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Arshad","id":"37604350900"},{"name":"Umair Razzaq","affiliation":["Irtiqa Technologies, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umair","lastName":"Razzaq","id":"37589615800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7074-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7073-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7072-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"5656326","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Finite impulse response filter","Clocks","Memory management","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","logic design","minimisation","parallel architectures","radar clutter","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based semiparallel architecture","higher order moving target indication processing","MTI processing","MTI engine","single chip radar signal processor","higher order filters","multiple offchip memory banks","memory bandwidth","minimization","parallel memory reading","data processing approach","DSP48 slice","multiply accumulate","MACC unit","Virtex-4SX35 FPGA","Xilinx XtremeDSP Kit","TA-10K air traffic control radar","clutter suppression capability"]}],"abstract":"The design and implementation of a higher order Moving Target Indication (MTI) engine is presented. This is part of a single chip radar signal processor also incorporating the subsequent algorithms. The bottleneck in use of higher order filters for MTI is not an algorithmic one but one related to implementation. Thus the challenge is to minimize area utilization and achieve the required speed. The proposed architecture employs the use of multiple offchip memory banks for achieving the required memory bandwidth and use of dedicated FPGA resources for area minimization. The requirement of stacking a large number of radar returns in memory and then reading them all for filtering within a single return time demands a parallel memory reading and data processing approach. But this demand has to be balanced with the requirement to consume as little area as possible to leave room for the following algorithms. Considering these constraints, a semi parallel architecture employing multiple filters, each built around a DSP48 slice configured as a Multiply Accumulate (MACC) unit in a time shared manner is used. An analysis of various factors that affect speed and area is also made. The architecture is implemented on a Virtex-4SX35 FPGA using Xilinx XtremeDSP Kit. The design is tested using unprocessed baseband data from a TA-10K air traffic control radar. Results show a marked improvement in the clutter suppression capability of the radar. The design achieves the required speed using only 7% of the available FPGA slices. Thus, not only can the other algorithms be implemented on the same chip but there is room for enhancements as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA based semi-parallel architecture for higher order Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 21st IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Protyping","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2010.5656326","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 21st IEEE International Symposium on Rapid System Protyping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5633873/5656325/05656326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2010.5656326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5656325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based semi-parallel architecture for higher order Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing","conferenceDate":"8-11 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656326/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11679277","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based semi-parallel architecture for higher order Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID1456567rsp22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051671S","chronDate":"8-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5633873","isNumber":"5656325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5633873","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5656325","articleId":"5656326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5656338,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Forward","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Forward","id":"37601742800"},{"name":"Omar Badreddin","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Badreddin","id":"37601740400"},{"name":"Timothy C.

Simulation results show that the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell system with the presented transmitter is improved significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656449.pdf","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1666","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A precoder for reducing downlink interference from femtocells to macro users based on cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Femtocells","Macrocell networks","Downlink","OFDM","Resource management","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","codecs","cognitive radio","interference (signal)","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoder","downlink interference","femtocells","macro user","cognitive radio","femtocell base station preprocessor","low complexity transmitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["preceding","femtocell","interference","cognitive radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A precoder for reducing downlink interference from femtocells to macro users based on cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656449/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687478","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A precoder for reducing downlink interference from femtocells to macro users based on cognitive radio","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"421si1574d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133263S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5656457,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lv","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lv","id":"37592319000"},{"name":"Tingting Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Liu","id":"37407006200"},{"name":"Xueying Hou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Hou","id":"37600938100"},{"name":"Chenyang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656457","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Femtocell networks","Interference channels","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference (signal)","radio spectrum management","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell networks","spectral efficient transmission","adaptive subband partition method","adaptive interference alignment transceiver","random frequency hopping"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a spectral efficient transmission scheme for femtocell networks, which includes an adaptive subband partition method and an adaptive interference alignment transceiver.

The said task was accomplished by first segmenting and computing the energy index measure and the averaged absolute amplitude of the suspected murmur, and then estimating the slope(s) of the averaged murmur signal energy and the averaged absolute amplitude through a linear fit. The procedure outlined was evaluated using both emulated systolic murmurs and clinically recorded heart murmurs. The evaluation has shown satisfactory and promising performance for future expansion.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656464","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656464.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart murmur detection and configuration estimation using wavelet transform and linear fit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heart murmur detection and configuration estimation using wavelet transform and linear fit","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656464/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687320","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656464/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart murmur detection and configuration estimation using wavelet transform and linear fit","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"439sf0160d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064776S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5656469,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Iqbal","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"37085994394"},{"name":"Tariq Aziz","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tariq","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37602999900"},{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292616000"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656469","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Parity check codes","Joints","Decoding","Correlation","Receivers","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","parity check codes","radio receivers","radio transmitters","redundancy","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal redundancy","data transmission","wireless sensor networks","joint source-channel coding","signal processing techniques","transmitter","receiver","distributed source coding theory","LDPC code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed source coding","Low Density Parity Check Codes","Sensor Networks","Slepian-Wolf Theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656469","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656469.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting temporal redundancy for efficient data transmission over wireless sensor networks","abstract":"Distributed joint source-channel coding technique is finding its application in the ever evolving world of telecommunication, especially in the sensor network paradigm.

The time-varying channel is well captured by the DPS-BEM, exploiting the unknown channel slepian correlation. The time-variations of the subblock DPS-BEM coefficients are likely much slower than that of the channel. Thus, the DPS-BEM is more convenient to track in time-varying environments. The DPS-BEM coefficients are estimated via subblock-wise, based on time-multiplexed periodically transmitted training symbols.

The simulation results show that the proposed method have good performance on spectrum reconstruction quality in fading channel environments and is robust to channel noise as well, meanwhile the signal can be acquired at sub-Nyquist sampling rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656478/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687501","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband spectrum detection using compressed sampling under fading channel environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband spectrum detection using compressed sampling under fading channel environments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"410si0677d2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051083S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5656484,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiyao Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37595285600"},{"name":"Shaohai Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaohai","lastName":"Hu","id":"37276260600"},{"name":"Yang Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37277583800"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiseon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656484","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Simulation","AWGN channels","Sparse matrices","Mobile communication","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protograph LDPC codes","Jacket matrices","protograph matrices","permutation matrices","parity check matrix","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Protograph LDPC codes","Jacket matrix","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method to construct the protograph LDPC codes based on Jacket matrices.

This technology is enabling IT managers to treat infrastructure as a common substrate on which they can provide services to users faster, in a much more flexible way and in cost-effective way -without having to re-design or add to the underlying infrastructure. Given the benefits of cloud computing, its broad appeal is not surprising. However, this new approach does raise some concerns. Chief among them is securing stored data in the cloud. In this paper, we focus on cloud data storage security, which has always been an important aspect of quality of service. To ensure the correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose a method by utilizing the homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-coded data. Our scheme achieves the integration of storage correctness insurance and data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server(s).","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654667/5655294/05656508.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2010.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2010.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring Data Storage Security in Cloud Computing through Two-Way Handshake Based on Token Management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","program verification","security of data","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way handshake","token management","cloud computing","cloud data storage security","quality of service","homomorphic token","distributed verification","erasure-coded data","storage correctness insurance","data error localization","misbehaving server"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","security","privacy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring Data Storage Security in Cloud Computing through Two-Way Handshake Based on Token Management","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679339","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring Data Storage Security in Cloud Computing through Two-Way Handshake Based on Token Management","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071841S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5656508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5656517,"authors":[{"name":"Bao Xiaomin","affiliation":["College of Informatics & Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bao","lastName":"Xiaomin","id":"37088242335"},{"name":"Ni Xiaoqing","affiliation":["College of Informatics & Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ni","lastName":"Xiaoqing","id":"37088240047"},{"name":"Wang Yaming","affiliation":["College of Informatics & Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yaming","id":"37546627000"},{"name":"Zhou Yanjiang","affiliation":["College of Machinery, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Yanjiang","id":"37088244723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5656517","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656517","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Olfactory","Weaving","Fabrics","Brain modeling","Biological neural networks","Pattern recognition","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","fabrics","image texture","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabric structure recognition","improved olfactory neural network","improved KIII stimulation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Olfactory Neural Network","KIII model","fabric recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICI.2010.75","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654674/5654767/05656517.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Fabric Structures Based on Improved Olfactory Neural Network","abstract":"This paper presents an improved KIII stimulation model based on olfactory neural network (ONN) system.

It is shown that the new algorithm works well for all the considered channels, indicating potential applications in the recognition of WPM signals in blind channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654674/5654767/05656589.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/AICI.2010.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of the Wavelet Packet Modulation Signals Based on Fractional Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Wavelet packets","Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","fading","Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet modulation signals","fractional Fourier transform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","classification feature parameter","additive white Gaussian noise","Rayleigh fading","frequency selective fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet packet modulation","modulation identification","fractional Fourier transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Identification of the Wavelet Packet Modulation Signals Based on Fractional Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5656589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690284","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of the Wavelet Packet Modulation Signals Based on Fractional Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4225a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067623S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654674","isNumber":"5654767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654674","xplore-issue":"5654767","articleId":"5656589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656591,"authors":[{"name":"Hailun Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hailun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537709900"},{"name":"Dongmei Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongmei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290810000"},{"name":"Ke Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37408672000"},{"name":"Zhengding Qiu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengding","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37286155900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5656591","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Polynomials","Spline","Interpolation","Cryptography","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cryptography","fuzzy set theory","image recognition","interpolation","polynomials","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy vault method","cubic spline interpolation","biometric cryptosystem","information security","cryptography","polynomial projection","piecewise low-degree polynomial","polynomial reconstruction","HA-BJTU palm print database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometric cryptosystem","fuzzy vault","polynomial reconstruction","cubic spline interpolation","palmprint"]}],"abstract":"Biometric cryptosystem has emerged as a promising solution in information security. Fuzzy vault is a widely accepted scheme binding biometric data and cryptography effectively. Polynomial projection is often used in the implementation of fuzzy vault. However, the drawback of polynomial projection is that the increase of key length would lead to a higher degree of polynomial, reconstruction of which would cause poor convergence in practice. To resolve the problem, we propose a new fuzzy vault method based on cubic spline interpolation. The piecewise low-degree polynomial of spline interpolation could overcome poor convergence problem and much longer key could be generated. Because the security of the fuzzy vault arises from the number of chaff points in the vault, the same security level could be guaranteed compared to polynomial reconstruction based fuzzy vault. Experimental results based on HA-BJTU palm print database show the feasibility of the proposed method and performances are satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/AICI.2010.28","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654674/5654767/05656591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654767","startPage":"103","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Fuzzy Vault Method Using Cubic Spline Interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Fuzzy Vault Method Using Cubic Spline Interpolation","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656591/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690282","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Fuzzy Vault Method Using Cubic Spline Interpolation","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4225a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087334S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654674","isNumber":"5654767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654674","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654767","articleId":"5656591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5656615,"authors":[{"name":"Jianting Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, North China Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianting","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598354200"},{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["School of Sciences, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Li","id":"37538671600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8432-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5656615","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Estimation","Source separation","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","gradient methods","independent component analysis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation algorithm","nonparametric adaptive kernel estimator","natural gradient optimization","source signal separation","probability distribution function","nonparametric fixed width kernel density estimator","score function","symmetric distribution","asymmetric distribution","independent component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind source separation (BSS)","independent component analysis (ICA)","adaptive kernel density estimator (AKDE)","fixed-width kernel density estimator (FKDE)"]}],"abstract":"Nonparametric adaptive kernel density estimator (NAKDE) based blind source separation(BSS) algorithm is proposed under the framework of natural gradient optimization method.

Traditional intelligent optimization algorithms have the common defects of early convergence and easily falling into local optimal solution in solving VRPTW. An improved hybrid particle swarm optimization (IHPSO) has been presented in this paper for the solution to the VRPTW. Population entropy is introduced to ensure the diversities of the solution. Some post-optimization procedures, such 2-opt, 1-1 opt and 1-0 opt, are adopted to optimize the inner or router route and modify illegal solutions.

Multi-user resource allocation with the target of maximizing the cognitive user's transmission rate and satisfying the proportional rate constraint between cognitive users is proposed in the condition of primary user's interference constraint. The paper supposes that cognitive transmitter obtains all cognitive users' instantaneous transmission channel and interference channel state information by the channel side information and cognitive users' cooperation. Hence, cognitive transmitters utilize these channel information to implement sub-carrier and power joint allocation. Sub-carrier allocation is implemented by sub-carrier efficiency function, while linear water-filling scheme is used in power allocation. Meanwhile, an average interference algorithm that do not need iterate is also proposed, which earns the approximate optimal gains and has some real-time features.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656656.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656656","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel sub-carrier and power joint allocation algorithm for multi-user cognitive OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel sub-carrier and power joint allocation algorithm for multi-user cognitive OFDM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656656/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656656/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687710","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel sub-carrier and power joint allocation algorithm for multi-user cognitive OFDM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"372si0085d4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049686S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656658,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Fu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongliang","lastName":"Fu","id":"37529791300"},{"name":"Tiejun Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596663100"},{"name":"Yong Tao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Tao","id":"37535170900"},{"name":"Chao Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Fan","id":"37536224300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656658","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear MMSE precoding detection algorithm","VBLAST","MIMO-MC-CDMA downlink system","spatial multiplexing","vertical bell labs layered space time","nonlinear THP precoding","interference suppression","frequency diversity gain","error propagation effect elimination","layered space-time codes","minimum mean square error criterion","linear precoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MC-CDMA","VBLAST","THP","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, considering the error propagation effect and high complexity of spatial multiplexing based vertical bell labs layered space time(VBLAST), a novel nonlinear MMSE-THP algorithm for VBLAST in MIMO-MC-CDMA downlink system is proposed in this paper.

To solve the problems, a simplified cooperative spatial multiplexing scheme is proposed, including BS and MS systems, where MIMO BS in a cell has two antennas and each MS of lower moving speed has one antenna only. To ensure communication quality of the network, the scheme applies LDPC as the channel coding instead of space-time coding for BSs and MSs. BS assigns the same CDMA channels for MSs to have larger space interval. Simulations show that good spatial multiplexing capacity and BER performance have been achieved by the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL

requires knowledge on channel correlation function. For systems with a small number of pilots operating in time-varying channels, however, information on channel correlation is difficult to acquire. In this paper, instead of estimating power-delay profile (PDP) with one of the three delay spread parameters: mean delay, root-mean-square (RMS) delay, and maximum delay spread, we propose an efficient method to approximate the multipath delay spread by the curvature of channel's amplitude, which is then used to generate the Wiener filter coefficients for data subcarriers channel estimation. The proposed technique could be applied to many prevailing wireless communication standards, and the performance of our proposal is investigated via simulations based on IEEE 802.16m packet structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-aided multipath delay spread approximation for MMSE channel estimation in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656678.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-aided multipath delay spread approximation for MMSE channel estimation in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656678/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687825","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-aided multipath delay spread approximation for MMSE channel estimation in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"379sf0365d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096921S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5656687,"authors":[{"name":"Ruizhen Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Key Laboratory of Advanced Information Science and Network Technology of Beijing, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruizhen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287902100"},{"name":"Baogui Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Key Laboratory of Advanced Information Science and Network Technology of Beijing, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baogui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599820300"},{"name":"Wanjuan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Key Laboratory of Advanced Information Science and Network Technology of Beijing, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wanjuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37596689000"},{"name":"Shaohai Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Key Laboratory of Advanced Information Science and Network Technology of Beijing, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaohai","lastName":"Hu","id":"37276260600"},{"name":"Mingui Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37309412500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656687","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Frequency modulation","Discrete cosine transforms","Sensors","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency modulation","signal reconstruction","signal representation","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","signal preprocessing method","sparse characteristic","frequency modulation pattern","difference matrix reconstruction","sparse signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse representation","frequency modulation","difference matrix","sparse reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"The sparse property of the signal to be processed is very important and directly affects the efficiency of compressive sensing.

However, ED requires accurate noise power to perform the detection and its performance is very sensitive to noise uncertainty. To overcome the limitation of ED, this paper proposes a novel spectrum sensing algorithm based on maximizing the geometric mean of the individual likelihood elements. The proposed method does not need any knowledge of the primary signal or noise power, so it is a blind spectrum sensing algorithm and its performance is robust to noise uncertainty. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the ED with 1 dB noise uncertainty and has almost identical detection probability as the ideal ED for the same false alarm probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656703/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11687862","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656703/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"386si0365d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060494S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5656708,"authors":[{"name":"Seda Senay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Seda","lastName":"Senay","id":"37589791000"},{"name":"Luis F.

Air leak detection plays an important role in ensuring excellent performance of products. If the detection accuracy is low, unqualified products may be judged as qualified or otherwise. So it is important to increase the detection accuracy which is influenced by temperature, test pressure, chamber volume, balance time and so on. It is not easy to compensate the detection error directly, for the movement status of the gas in the chamber being complicated. This paper applies radial basis function(RBF)neural network to establish the function relationship between the leakage and influence factors and predict the differential pressure value which is used to determine whether the products leak or not. Experiment results using test data obtained on the differential-pressure-based air leak detection platform show that detection using RBF neural network has a higher accuracy than the detection not using it and RBF neural network for accuracy increase in air leak detection is feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/AICI.2010.51","startPage":"211","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654674/5654767/05656763.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Pressure Prediction in Air Leak Detection Using RBF Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leak detection","Artificial neural networks","Accuracy","Neurons","Pressure measurement","Radial basis function networks","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leak detection","production engineering computing","radial basis function networks","seals (stoppers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential pressure prediction","air leak detection","RBF neural network","radial basis function neural network","product performance","detection accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF Neural Network","Air Leak Detection","Differential Pressure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Differential Pressure Prediction in Air Leak Detection Using RBF Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5656763/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690381","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Pressure Prediction in Air Leak Detection Using RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4225a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064568S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654674","isNumber":"5654767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654674","xplore-issue":"5654767","articleId":"5656763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5656774,"authors":[{"name":"Pottigar Vinayak Vidyasagar","firstName":"Pottigar Vinayak","lastName":"Vidyasagar","id":"37087251088"},{"name":"Sudhir Sawarkar","affiliation":["Computer Dept.

The communication or message passing process must be designed to conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. The sensors communicate information only to cluster heads and then the cluster heads communicate the aggregated information to the processing centre, may save energy.

Matrix inversion is the most costly computational module within the Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) based MIMO receiver. For LTE Release 8, the order of the matrix to be inverted for an MMSE receiver is 2 \u00d7 2 for 2-stream MIMO. Going forward to LTE release 10, 4-stream MIMO can potentially double the throughput, but the matrix to be inverted will grow to 4 \u00d7 4, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we will exam several software implementations of 4 \u00d7 4 matrix inversion. We will demonstrate how we can significantly reduce the cost (both in terms of cycle counts and development time) while maintaining enough output precision to meet performance requirements by using the floating-point feature of Texas Instruments' (TI) new multicore System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656837.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On matrix inversion for LTE MIMO applications using Texas Instruments floating point DSP","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","MIMO","System-on-a-chip","Covariance matrix","Wireless communication","Clocks","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","multiprocessing systems","radio receivers","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix inversion","LTE MIMO application","multiple-input multiple-output system","floating point DSP","broadband wireless service","minimum mean-square error based MIMO receiver","MMSE based MIMO receiver","multicore system-on-a-chip architecture","SoC","Texas instruments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["4\u00d74 matrix inversion","Floating-point DSP","MIMO","LTE","Texas Instruments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On matrix inversion for LTE MIMO applications using Texas Instruments floating point DSP","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656837/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687871","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On matrix inversion for LTE MIMO applications using Texas Instruments floating point DSP","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"163isi0003d3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041996S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5656839,"authors":[{"name":"Jim-Fang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Basic Science, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jim-Fang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601214200"},{"name":"Hong-Wu Hei","affiliation":["Shandong Labor Union Management, Cadres Institute, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Wu","lastName":"Hei","id":"37591174700"},{"name":"Zhun Wang","affiliation":["Brm Aviation Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597996700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656839","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"abstract":"In this paper we get new sampling formulae for reconstructing signals that are band limited in the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) sense.

Several algorithms have been proposed for homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed computing systems. In this paper we propose a static list Path based Heuristic Task Scheduling (PHTS) algorithm to efficiently schedule tasks on the heterogeneous distributed computing systems. The algorithm is mainly focused on reducing the makespan. It consists of three phases: A path prioritizing phase, selecting all possible paths from the given graph and sorting them by descending order. Secondly, a task selection phase, selecting the tasks from the sorted paths and finally, a processor selection phase, assigning the tasks to processors which minimizes the completion time. From the theoretical analysis of the PHTS algorithm with HEFT for a DAG graph, the better schedule length is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656868/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656868/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11679406","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Path-Based Heuristic Task Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Distributed Computing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path-Based Heuristic Task Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Distributed Computing Systems","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054522S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5656868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656874,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Self recurrent wavelet neural network (SRWNN) is used to approximate the uncertainties present in the system as well as to identify and compensate the nonlinearities introduced in the system due to actuator saturation. By using suitable transformation the system under consideration is first converted into an affine like form and subsequently an adaptive backstepping control strategy is developed to assure the stable tracking of nonlinear non affine system. In addition robust control terms are also designed to attenuate the approximation error due to SRWNN. Adaptation laws are developed for the online tuning of the wavelet parameters and the stability of the overall system is assured by using the Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional. The effectiveness of theoretical development is verified by a numerical example.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2010.47","startPage":"60","endPage":"65","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654667/5655294/05656874.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2010.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Tracking Control for a Class of Uncertain Non-affine Delayed Systems Subjected to Input Constraints Using Self Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Backstepping","Actuators","Adaptive systems","Function approximation","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","adaptive control","delays","Lyapunov methods","recurrent neural nets","robust control","uncertain systems","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive tracking control","uncertain nonaffine delayed systems","input constraints","self recurrent wavelet neural network","actuator saturation","SRWNN","adaptive backstepping control strategy","stable tracking","robust control","online tuning","adaptation laws","wavelet parameters","Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-affine systems","self recurrent wavelet networks","backstepping control","adaptive control","delayed systems","actuator saturation","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Tracking Control for a Class of Uncertain Non-affine Delayed Systems Subjected to Input Constraints Using Self Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679382","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Tracking Control for a Class of Uncertain Non-affine Delayed Systems Subjected to Input Constraints Using Self Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059882S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5656874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5656880,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for 3D-based face recognition. The key idea in the proposed algorithm is a correlative feature representation of the facial surface, by what is called 3D Local Binary Patterns (3D LBP), which encode relationships in neighboring mesh nodes and own more potential power to describe the structure of faces than individual points. The signature images are then decomposed into their principle components based on Spectral Regression resulting in a huge time saving. Our experiments were based on the CASIA 3D face database. Experimental results show our framework provides better effectiveness and efficiency than many commonly used existing methods for 3D face recognition and handles variations in facial expression quite well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656905.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1385","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust 3D face recognition using learn correlative features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Face recognition","Face","Feature extraction","Databases","Shape","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","regression analysis","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust 3D face recognition","correlative feature representation","facial surface","3D local binary patterns","mesh nodes","spectral regression","CASIA 3D face database","facial expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D face recognition","3D Local Binary Patterns (3DLBP)","Spectral Regression","expression variations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust 3D face recognition using learn correlative features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656905/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687714","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust 3D face recognition using learn correlative features","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"355si0518d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049946S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5656913,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Sharma","affiliation":["Digital Systems Group, ISRO Satellite Center, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37589201200"},{"name":"Sunil Kulkarn","affiliation":["Digital Syst.

Depending on the requirements of a particular system, different modulation techniques are being used. In general, M-PSK modulation techniques are preferable as they are power and bandwidth efficient. The paper presents the digital implementation QPSK & 8-PSK modulators for satellite communication. The modulators are realized using the concept of Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis (DDFS). The use of look up table and COrdinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm is explained in details with their comparison on the basis of spectral purity and hardware requirements. The paper describes different methods of implementations of QPSK and 8-PSK modulator with comparison in terms of hardware requirement. The design of modulators are first developed, simulated and optimized on the software tool and then coded in VHDL for hardware realization.

The Maximum Likelihood (ML) DOA estimator and CRB for MIMO sonar is described. The performance of MIMO sonar based on different waveforms is analyzed via experiments in an anechoic water tank. Simulation and experimental results show that the waveforms which we design possess the higher resolution for multiple source DOA estimation than its phased-array and they could resolve the two targets with a separation of 1/2 beam width at low SNR. The analysis of DOA estimates and experimental results show that the OFD-PR signal has much better performance than others.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal waveforms design and performance analysis for MIMO sonar","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656922.pdf","startPage":"2382","endPage":"2385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal waveforms design and performance analysis for MIMO sonar","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656922/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687827","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal waveforms design and performance analysis for MIMO sonar","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"611si0769d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111018S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656928,"authors":[{"name":"Jithin P.

A method for GPS precision enhancement commonly used by civil users is the Differential GPS (DGPS). If DGPS service is interrupted, it will lead to the degraded navigation performance. This paper focuses on applying a \u03a0-\u03a3 Neural Network (PSNN) model to predict Pseudo-Range Corrections (PRC) for DGPS. A low cost commercial module (Rockwell single-frequency GPS receiver) is employed to represent the improvement in DGPS.

One common issue in deployment of a multi-channel multi-AP wireless network is interference. One of the reasons why theoretical throughput (54 Mbps for 802.11g) can't be achieved is co-channel interference. In this paper, the effect of co-channel interference on data throughput has been studied in a practical multiple AP (access point) scenario. Interference can be minimized by adjusting the transmission power. This paper also provides an algorithm for transmission power adjustment of APs by using the concept of cognitive radio, which eventually helps in minimizing co-channel interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2010.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655294","startPage":"158","endPage":"160","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654667/5655294/05656936.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Co-channel Interference in WLAN and Cognitive Radio Based Approach to Minimize It","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656936/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Co-channel Interference in WLAN and Cognitive Radio Based Approach to Minimize It","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11679401","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Co-channel Interference in WLAN and Cognitive Radio Based Approach to Minimize It","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041117S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5656936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5656939,"authors":[{"name":"Kongcun Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Kongcun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536118900"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37270835500"},{"name":"Yongming Cheng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37537819600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656939","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Marine animals","Quantum mechanics","Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","quantum theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["niche quantum artificial fish swarm algorithm","quantum theory","swarm intelligence optimization","global optimal solution","restricted competition selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AFSA","niche","RCS strategy","quantum mechanism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656939","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656939.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Niche Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm based on quantum theory","abstract":"Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm which is designed to find the single optimal solution for a given problem.

In this paper, it is analytically shown that the performance of this estimator is less sensitive to the erroneous estimation of the Rice factor. Moreover, to estimate the channel Rice factor in the above mentioned channel model, two algorithms are proposed. These algorithms work based on the optimal training signal and Least Squares (LS) technique. The estimated Rice factor is used in the SSLS estimator. The performance of these algorithms is numerically compared in the Rician fading channel estimation.

It is believed that the output energy will inevitably be scaled down due to the non-zero contribution of the CC term. No elegant remedy to the scaling problem presently exists. We mathematically derive this scaling factor and subsequently propose a simple method to restore the output energy back to unity by modifying the dispersion constant of the CC-CMA. We verified our analytical claims with supportive simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656953.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1448","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy normalized cross-correlation constant modulus algorithm in a MIMO convolutive system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","MIMO","Steady-state","Blind equalizers","Bit error rate","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","blind source separation","correlation methods","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-correlation method","MIMO convolutive system","blind equalization","source separation","multipath systems","constant modulus algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy normalized cross-correlation constant modulus algorithm in a MIMO convolutive system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5656953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687846","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy normalized cross-correlation constant modulus algorithm in a MIMO convolutive system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"369sf0321d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0813S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5656953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656961,"authors":[{"name":"Putnanjan Sumathi","affiliation":["ECE, Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Putnanjan","lastName":"Sumathi","id":"37603945400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8093-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4201-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5656961","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","combinational circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","logic testing","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test scheme","FPGA structure","interconnect cells","configurable logic blocks","I/O pads","physical path","combinational circuits","sequential circuits","logic functions","FPGA testing","logical testing","interconnect testing fault models","wire connections","Walsh code","binary numbers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Interconnect Testing"]}],"abstract":"Any FPGA structure has interconnect cells, configurable logic blocks and I/O pads.

The design of CORDIC in the circular rotation mode gives a high system throughput due to its pipelined architecture by reducing latency in each individual pipelined stage. Saving area on silicon substrate is essential to the design of pipelined CORDIC and that can be achieved through the optimization in the number of micro rotations. The computed quantization error is also minimized using required number of iterations. The pipelined architecture can be easily integrated in VLSI technology due to its regularity and modularity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2010.94","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2010.94","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654667/5655294/05656965.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5655294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Architecture Design and Implementation for Application Specific CORDIC Processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architecture Design and Implementation for Application Specific CORDIC Processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5656965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688382","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5656965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architecture Design and Implementation for Application Specific CORDIC Processor","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"4201a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036923S","chronDate":"16-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654667","isNumber":"5655294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654667","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5655294","articleId":"5656965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5656990,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37598054900"},{"name":"Ju Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279467700"},{"name":"Lina Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37402716900"},{"name":"Yuxi Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yuxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598248700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5656990","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity reception","Upper bound","Fading","Simulation","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","computational complexity","cooperative communication","diversity reception","error detection","iterative methods","Monte Carlo methods","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward cooperative communication","iterative generalized selection combining","error detection","maximal ratio combining","diversity path","computational complexity","outage probability","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656990","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05656990.pdf","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of novel generalized selection combining in amplify-and-forward cooperative communications","abstract":"This paper presents an novel iterative generalized selection combining (IGSC) for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative communications based on error detection and rearranging the SNR of indirect link in decreasing order of magnitude.

The incoming path is rearranged by the decreasing order of magnitude. Because of the computational complexity of the outage probability, we derive the upper and lower bound of the outage probability.

Moreover, since the effective assignment of nodes to missions is a NP-complete problem, a novel quantum genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it.

The method can reduce noise by optimizing the parameter p in (p, u) plane. The filtering performance is regulated by the correlation coefficient, and evaluated by mean square error (MSE).

In the situation of array amplitude and phase errors, signal steering errors and other data mismatch, this paper put forward a new method. This new algorithm can enhance the desired signal and suppress the interference signals simultaneity. The new algorithm estimates the power of desired signal by oblique projection property to add some interference signals. Interference signal has the same power. It is different from other methods. So this processing is specially suit to the situation of the difference power between the desired and interference signal. This technique is presented to widen null of array pattern stably. The performance in the present of array amplitude and phase errors and signal steering errors is assured by the uncertain range restriction. Certainly, this optimization with some restriction can be solved by the lagrange method. The iterative weight vector is proved to be convergent. The new algorithm is not complex.

The main objective of this algorithm is to reduce real-world interference signals such as radio, television or computer fan noise from an acquired speech signal. The proposed algorithm improves the current design of the switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer structure by introducing an adaptive nonlinear neural network filter for the noise reduction section. The network topology used here is a partially connected three-layer feedforward neural network structure. The error backpropagation algorithm is used here as the learning algorithm. A comparison analysis of the traditional three-microphone linear beamformer and the proposed three-microphone neural switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer structure is discussed here. They are both tested with different types of interference signal from the Noise-X database. All the experiments are conducted in real-world surroundings. The nonlinear approach introduced here shows remarkable improvement over the previous linear adaptive beamformer approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657119/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11687734","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657119/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-microphone adaptive neural switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer for noise reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-microphone adaptive neural switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer for noise reduction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"076sf0376d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108744S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5657119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657151,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Mahdavi","affiliation":["Electronic Research Center, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ala","lastName":"Mahdavi","id":"37601735400"},{"name":"Amir Mansour Pezeshk","affiliation":["Electronic Research Center, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Mansour","lastName":"Pezeshk","id":"37601734000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5657151","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"abstract":"One of the main problems of radar identification in electronic warfare support system is analysis of pulse repetition interval (PRI) modulation.

In addition, through taking advantage of the two-version signals' amplitude information, the digital IFM receiver designed with the given IFM receiver structure demonstrates better simultaneous signals processing performance.

In this algorithm, output generated by the bit plane coder (BPC) is supplied to an MQ coder. Though several high speed BPC architectures are available, overall performance EBCOT algorithm is getting restricted by the speed of an MQ coder. Therefore, we propose a high speed, area efficient VLSI architecture for an MQ coder. This pipelined design is implemented on Startix series FPGA and it operates at 153 MHz. The synthesis report demonstrates that as compared to existing designs, the requirement of logic- and memory-elements is reduced by about 71.53% and 59.3%, respectively. Throughput of the proposed MQ coder is 137.7 MS/s which is 1.85 times higher compared to the designs reported. The renormalization module is capable of operating at 326 MHz. So, coding efficiency can further be improved by using multiple clock domains.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639099/5654687/05657177.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5657177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5657177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-cost, high-performance VLSI design of an MQ coder for JPEG 2000","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Transform coding","Clocks","Image coding","Positron emission tomography","Encoding","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","clocks","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","pipeline arithmetic","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance VLSI design","MQ coder","embedded block coding","optimized truncation","EBCOT","JPEG 2000 image compression","bit plane coder","high speed BPC architecture","Startix series FPGA","pipelined design","logic element","memory element","renormalization module","multiple clock domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MQ coder","JPEG 2000","Arithmetic Encoder","VLSI Architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-cost, high-performance VLSI design of an MQ coder for JPEG 2000","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657177/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11687769","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-cost, high-performance VLSI design of an MQ coder for JPEG 2000","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"100sf0076d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063056S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639099","isNumber":"5654687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639099","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5654687","articleId":"5657177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657181,"authors":[{"name":"P Subramanian","affiliation":["System LSI Group, Samsung India Software Operations Private Limited, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"38255757000"},{"name":"A Sagar Chaitanya Reddy","affiliation":["System LSI Group, Samsung India Software Operations Private Limited, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"A Sagar Chaitanya","lastName":"Reddy","id":"38255616600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5900-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5899-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"5657181","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"abstract":"The Discrete Cosine transform is widely used as the core of digital image compression.

We analyze the effect of dispersion maps for four different fiber types and show that with sufficiently large per-span under-compensation in the double periodic dispersion map, a dispersion managed (DM) link can nearly have a similar performance to a non-DM link. Furthermore, we confirm that the super large effective area fiber family can provide around 3 dB advantage in the tolerance to nonlinear effects compared to standard single-mode fiber. Finally, we demonstrate that interleaving the two polarization tributaries of the 111-Gb/s POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK signal provides only a negligible advantage in terms of tolerance to nonlinear effects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Tolerance of 111-Gb/s POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK to Nonlinear Transmission Effects","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2096497","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5680666/05657218.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2096497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Tolerance of 111-Gb/s POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK to Nonlinear Transmission Effects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5657218/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"11729627","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Tolerance of 111-Gb/s POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK to Nonlinear Transmission Effects","sourcePdf":"jlt-alfiad-2096497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090794S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5680666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5680666","articleId":"5657218","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5657220,"authors":[{"name":"Radhakrishnan Nagarajan","affiliation":["Infinera Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Radhakrishnan Nagarajan (S'85\u2013M'92\u2013SM'97\u2013F'08) received the B.Eng.

The proposed antenna has four L-shaped slots on the ground plane, and the CP radiation can be generated by current perturbation due to the slotted ground plane. Because the CP sense of the proposed antenna is altered by the current path that is redirected with switched p-i-n diodes on the slots, the CP direction of the proposed antenna can be simply switched between the right-handed and left-handed CPs. As the slot and bias circuits are not placed on the patch side, the proposed antenna has a simple structure and can radiate a CP wave without altering the main beam direction. The experimental results show that antennas have excellent switchable radiation performance at 2.4 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11704282","htmlLink":"/document/5657230/","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Circularly Polarized Microstrip Antenna With a Slotted Ground Plane","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Circularly Polarized Microstrip Antenna With a Slotted Ground Plane","sourcePdf":"lawp-yoon-2096794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056601S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5657230","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5657237,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37400245700"},{"name":"Jun Duan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Duan","id":"37530232800"},{"name":"Cheng Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Hong","id":"37396954200"},{"name":"Peng Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37411096600"},{"name":"Weiwei Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37273482700"},{"name":"Zhangyuan Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangyuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291474800"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"38185564300"},{"name":"Hequan Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hequan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37598640900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5657237","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1005},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We have experimentally demonstrated a 60-GHz bidirectional radio-over-fiber system with single-sideband (SSB) modulation of orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals for the downlink and wavelength reuse for the uplink.

Our approach is based on the maximization of the smaller of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of the two transceivers under a total transmit power budget. We show that this problem has a closed-form solution and requires only a single integer parameter (i.e, the index of the optimally selected relay) to be broadcasted to all relays. We also show that for large values of the total transmit power, the selection criterion can be approximated as the harmonic mean of the amplitudes of the relays' local channel coefficients. We evaluate the performance of our scheme numerically.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5672529/05657242.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2096466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2096466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Two-Way Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transceivers","Resource management","Joints","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Bidirectional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio links","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","two-way relay network","optimal joint relay selection","communication link","transceiver","received signal-to-noise-ratios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative networks","power allocation","relay selection","SNR balancing","two-way relay networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Two-Way Relay Networks","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5657242/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704492","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"lsp-shahbazpanahi-2096466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055643S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5672529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5672529","articleId":"5657242","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5657251,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Education Ministry, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5733940/5657251/5657251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Huang received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Education Ministry, ZJU.

In this study, we proposed a novel method for detection of the transition between AF and sinus rhythm based on RR intervals. First, we obtained the delta RR interval distri bution difference curve from the density histogram of delta RR intervals, and then detected its peaks, which represented the AF events. Once an AF event was detected, four successive steps were used to classify its type, and thus, determine the boundary of AF: 1) histogram analysis; 2) standard deviation analysis; 3) numbering aberrant rhythms recognition; and 4) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. A dataset of 24-h Holter ECG recordings (n = 433) and two MIT-BIH databases (MIT-BIH AF database and MIT-BIH nor mal sinus rhythm (NSR) database) were used for development and evaluation. Using the receiver operating characteristic curves for determining the threshold of the K-S test, we have achieved the highest performance of sensitivity and specificity (SP) (96.1% and 98.1%, respectively) for the MIT-BIH AF database, compared with other previously published algorithms. The SP was 97.9% for the MIT-BIH NSR database.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Detection of the Transition Between Atrial Fibrillation and Sinus Rhythm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2096506","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5733940/05657251.pdf","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2096506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Detection of the Transition Between Atrial Fibrillation and Sinus Rhythm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5657251/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11904091","pubMedId":"21134807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Detection of the Transition Between Atrial Fibrillation and Sinus Rhythm","sourcePdf":"tbme-ye-2096506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101264S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5733940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5733940","articleId":"5657251","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5657253,"authors":[{"name":"Jiuxiang Dong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry (Ministry of Education), Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5740515/5657253/5657253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiuxiang Dong was born in Shenyang, China, on January 2, 1978.

Based on the objective function properties, an efficient Trojan detection method with strong approximation and optimality guarantees is introduced. Signal processing methods for calibrating the impact of interchip and intrachip correlations are presented. We define a new sensitivity metric that formally quantifies the impact of modifications to each existing gate that is affected by Trojan. Using the new metric, we compare the Trojan detection capability of different measurement types for static (quiescent) current, dynamic (transient) current, and timing (delay) side-channel measurements. We propose four methods for combining the detection results that are gained from different measurement modalities and show how the sensitivity results can be used for a systematic combining of the detection results.

The parallel-connected inverter ensures active and reactive power flow from the grid with low-current total harmonic distortion even in the presence of nonlinear load. A p-q theory-based approach is used to find the reference current of the parallel-connected converter to ensure desired operating conditions at the grid terminal. The proposed current controller is simple to implement and gives superior performance over the conventional current controllers, such as rotating frame proportional-integral controller or stationary frame proportional resonant controller. The stability of the proposed controller is ensured by direct Lyapunov method. A new technique based on the spatial repetitive controller is also proposed to improve the performance of the current controller by estimating the grid and other periodic disturbances.

The inverter compensating voltage works in such a way that, irrespective of any type of disturbances in the microgrid voltage (such as sag, swell, or harmonic distortions), the load voltage is maintained at its rated voltage level with low total harmonic distortion (THD) in voltage. The proposed control strategy also facilitates a specific amount of active power flow (from renewable energy source) to the load irrespective of the microgrid voltage condition. The rest of the load power is supplied by the microgrid. To facilitate this control strategy, a spatial repetitive controller (SRC) is proposed and implemented in microgrid phase (\u03b8) domain to make the controller independent of the microgrid frequency. The proposed controller ensures dynamic stability of the system even if there is a sudden change in the microgrid frequency.

A 1-kW prototype has been designed and implemented to validate the proposed architecture and system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2096562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05657267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2096562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","startPage":"886","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-efficiency grid-tie battery energy storage system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high-efficiency grid-tie battery energy storage system","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004917","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5657267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-efficiency grid-tie battery energy storage system","sourcePdf":"tpel-qian-2096562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104942S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5657267","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5657271,"authors":[{"name":"Adem Coskun","affiliation":["Applied DSP and VLSI Research Group (ADVRG), University of Westminster, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Adem","lastName":"Coskun","id":"37304159900"},{"name":"Cagatay Candan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cagatay","lastName":"Candan","id":"37449269100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5657271","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":834},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"We examine the application of transmit precoding in multiuser multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) communication systems with maximum ratio combining (MRC) receivers. In many multiuser applications, the maximum-likelihood or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers can be prohibitive to implement due to their high implementation complexity. We examine the performance of the system with simple MRC receivers and carefully selected precoders, which are designed to compensate the lack of high-complexity receivers, at the transmitter side. We examine the sum MSE minimization and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing frameworks for the selection of precoders. The performance of two frameworks with MRC receivers are compared between themselves as well as with their counterparts implementing MMSE receivers. It has been observed that the SINR balancing framework with simple MRC receivers has little performance loss in comparison with the MMSE receivers with a proper selection of precoders.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05657271.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Optimal Cooperative Sensing and Resource Allocation in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In this paper, the problem of joint multichannel cooperative sensing and resource allocation is investigated. A cognitive radio network with multiple potential channels and multiple secondary users is considered. Each secondary user carries out wideband spectrum sensing to get a test statistic for each channel and transmits the test statistic to a coordinator. After collecting all the test statistics from secondary users, the coordinator makes the estimation as to whether primary users are idle or not in the channels. When a channel is estimated to be free, secondary users can get access to the channel with assigned bandwidth and power. An optimization problem is formulated, which maximizes the weighted sum of secondary users' throughputs while guaranteeing a certain level of protection for the activities of primary users. Although the problem is nonconvex, it is shown that the problem can be solved by bilevel optimization and monotonic programming. This paper is also extended to cases with consideration of proportional and max-min fairness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657272/","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5657272/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11807411","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimal Cooperative Sensing and Resource Allocation in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimal Cooperative Sensing and Resource Allocation in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-jiang-2096545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051656S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5657272","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657273,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5702419/5657273/5657273-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Zhu (S'07) received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China in 2006, and the M.Phil. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008.

New multimedia services demand data-rates of up to hundreds of Mbps and thus higher frequency bands are being explored to support these new high data rate services. However, to support mobility, handoff is a must in many of these networks and systems. In the mean time the 60 GHz band has received much attention due to its 5 GHz of the available spectrum globally. However, the 60 GHz channels face many challenges such as high attenuation and NLOS propagation. The high reduction in signal strength as a function of distance results in a small coverage area, thereby causing frequent handoffs for mobile terminals. In this paper, we discuss and compare handoff algorithms intended for WLAN, GSM, UMTS, etc. We study these algorithms from the point of view of their usability in 60 GHz networks and make recommendations for handoff algorithms in such networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"First Quarter 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12539533","htmlLink":"/document/5657690/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Handoffs \u2014 Lessons for 60 GHz Based Wireless Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Handoffs \u2014 Lessons for 60 GHz Based Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"05quang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150675S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6151681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6151681","articleId":"5657690","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5657691,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Domenico","affiliation":["CEA/LETI Laboratories-MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6151681/5657691/5657691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio De Domenico obtained his Masters degree from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2008, and he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the CEA/LETI Labs - MINATEC, Grenoble, France.

Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols exploit sensing stimuli to build up a spectrum opportunity map (cognitive sensing). Available resources are scheduled (dynamic spectrum allocation), improving coexistence between users that belong to heterogeneous systems (dynamic spectrum sharing). Furthermore, MAC protocols may allow cognitive users to vacate selected channels when their quality becomes unacceptable (dynamic spectrum mobility). The contribution of this survey is threefold. First, we show the fundamental role of the MAC layer and identify its functionalities in a cognitive radio (CR) network. Second, a classification of cognitive MAC protocols is proposed. Third, advantages, drawbacks, and further design challenges of cognitive MAC protocols are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on MAC Strategies for Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.111510.00108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6151681/05657691.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.111510.00108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on MAC Strategies for Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5657691/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2012","accessionNumber":"12539534","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on MAC Strategies for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"03DeDomenico.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141441S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6151681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"6151681","articleId":"5657691","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5657693,"authors":[{"name":"Adolph Seema","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Eng., Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6026692/5657693/5657693-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adolph Seema has a wide range of experiences spanning more than eight years in the Semiconductor Industry, including VLSI chip verification at Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA; PCB driver development for satellite synchronized network time servers and displays at Spectracom Corp., Rochester, NY; and Zigbee and RF232 wireless PCB design at FSI Systems, Inc., Farmington, NY.

While intrusion detection systems have been popular in wired networks for a long time, their wireless equivalents are very limited. Anomaly-based detection methods have received an increasing interest by the scientific community in the last years. They are able to fight attacks without the need of previous and thorough characterization. However, their application to wireless environments is more recent. In this paper we review some of the last proposals in this field. We also introduce a functional intrusion detection system that combines them in order to offer resilient detection of the most common attacks in 802.11 networks.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657702","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An anomaly-based intrusion detection system for IEEE 802.11 networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An anomaly-based intrusion detection system for IEEE 802.11 networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657702/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688512","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657702/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anomaly-based intrusion detection system for IEEE 802.11 networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569347381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05203S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657704,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Petracca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Petracca","id":"37529439200"},{"name":"Remo Pomposini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Remo","lastName":"Pomposini","id":"37546378600"},{"name":"Franco Mazzenga","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Mazzenga","id":"37273229500"},{"name":"Romeo Giuliano","affiliation":["RadioLaboratories, Laboratori di Radiocomunicazioni, Consorzio Universit\u00e0 Industria, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Romeo","lastName":"Giuliano","id":"37266364600"},{"name":"Marco Vari","affiliation":["RadioLaboratories, Laboratori di Radiocomunicazioni, Consorzio Universit\u00e0 Industria, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Vari","id":"37266474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9229-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9230-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9228-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-972X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5657704","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative sensing","cognitive radio network","opportunistic spectrum access","OSA","spectral efficiency","ultra-wideband technique","UWB technique","multihop underlay signalling network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657704","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An always available control channel for cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In the Cognitive Radio (CR) framework, the Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) is a promising solution to increase spectral efficiency. However in an OSA network secondary unlicensed cognitive nodes have to agree on which spectral resources they are allowed to use without compromising performance of primary licensed users. This requires a common control channel for sharing spectrum sensing information. Among the ways to realize it, the utilization of Ultra-wideband (UWB) techniques has been proposed in the literature. In this paper we face the problem of dimensioning an \u201calways on\u201d underlay UWB signalling network for sensing information exchange among secondary CR nodes avoiding harmful interference to primary users.

This paper addresses the problem of power management to insure on one hand, no interference with primary user and on the other hand, the requested QoS (Quality of Service) level to the secondary transmitter. In this paper we propose a two steps method to determine the transmission power of cognitive transmissions. In the first step \u201cWorst cases power management : WCPM\u201d, we show that, although it's a very quick and preventive method, using this power management procedure leads to a limitation in the range of the cognitive radio network.

The proposed technique combats subcarrier fading using a linear spreading of the source information in the spatial and frequency domains. Unlike previous works, it is assumed that the receiver does not necessarily has to rely on linear processing, allowing in this way more powerful receiver strategies. In particular, it is shown that a detector based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion brings along important performance benefits. Different spreading strategies are evaluated in terms of their performance and ML detection complexity. It can be observed that spreading the information and optimising the system over a group of subcarriers (rather than on a per subcarrier-basis or all subcarriers together) extracts virtually all the diversity the wireless channel can provide while remaining computationally feasible.

The analytical framework proposed in this paper is used to assess the multiuser capacity, packet delay performance and fairness for different channel- and/or QoS-aware resource allocation algorithms proposed in the literature and different MIMO channel configurations.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657727","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual methods for channel- and QoS-aware resource allocation in MIMO-OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual methods for channel- and QoS-aware resource allocation in MIMO-OFDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657727/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688477","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657727/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual methods for channel- and QoS-aware resource allocation in MIMO-OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569341393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062347S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657735,"authors":[{"name":"Louisa P.

Roughly two decades later, van der Meulen introduced relay channels and Cover introduced the idea of broadcasting and taking advantage of spatial diversity. Since then, numerous researchers have placed their focuses on different aspects of peer-to-peer networks. This paper covers three different bounds that deal with peer-to-peer networks as well as cooperative networks beyond the peer-to-peer sense. First, a novel idea of applying information theory to switching networks to allow an easily computable bound for studying the behavior of an ad hoc network via various parameters is introduced. Second, multiple nodes cooperatively relaying packets is simulated to determine the benefits of allowing more nodes to cooperate together. It is found that more than two nodes cooperating together provided insignificant gain over the two-node cooperation. The result leads to modeling a network with two-node cooperation under a frequency reuse scheme. The result shows that cooperation is useful in a small network, but the gain in capacity diminishes as SNR increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657735/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688534","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A study on the capacity bounds of wireless ad hoc networks from peer-to-peer to multiple nodes cooperation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the capacity bounds of wireless ad hoc networks from peer-to-peer to multiple nodes cooperation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569341311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044886S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5657738,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyan Lu","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinyan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37597288100"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599475200"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292040700"},{"name":"Depei Qian","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Depei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37289498500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9229-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9230-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9228-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-972X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5657738","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657738","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Cognitive radio","Games","Relays","Receivers","Radio transmitters","NIST"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput maximization","bargaining game","cognitive radio network","BBC","licensed user","Nash equilibrium solution","unlicensed user"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","cooperation","bargaining game","communication interruption"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657738","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput maximization with bargaining game in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Recently, a cooperative paradigm in cognitive radio networks, where licensed user can leverage its own bandwidth to unlicensed user in exchange for relaying its traffic, has been advocated to further improve all participates' performance.

To support Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMS), LTE offers functionality to transmit MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN), where a time-synchronized common waveform is transmitted from multiple cells for a given duration. This significantly improves the Spectral Efficiency (SE) compared to conventional MBMS operation. The achieved SE is mainly determined by the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) utilized by the LTE physical layer. In this paper we propose and evaluate four approaches for the selection of the MCS that will be utilized for the transmission of the MBSFN data. The evaluation of the approaches is performed for different users' distribution and from SE perspective.

One key feature of this protocol is its multi-source operation, coding packets from different sources in the same generation. The protocol also efficiently controls the number of re-transmissions based on neighborhood information, limits the size of generations by introducing the concept of Generation Distance (GD) for multi-source operation, supports early decoding, and adaptively calculates the time-out for generations based on the generation size and transmission rate (packets/sec). Simulation results show that inter-mixing of packets from different sources results in improved Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) as well as lower latency, compared to the already proposed single-source schemes. We also investigated its adaptive performance compared to a baseline flooding protocol and show that our protocol delivers consistently high PDR and low latency in both single-source and multi-source scenarios for a range of network densities and traffic rates.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657753","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657753.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Random Linear Network Coding with Controlled Forwarding for wireless broadcast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657753/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Random Linear Network Coding with Controlled Forwarding for wireless broadcast","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657753/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Random Linear Network Coding with Controlled Forwarding for wireless broadcast","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569340751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071369S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657754,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Angela Sara","lastName":"Cacciapuoti","id":"37599897900"},{"name":"Cosimo Calcagno","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Cosimo","lastName":"Calcagno","id":"37599882800"},{"name":"Marcello Caleffi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Caleffi","id":"37567814300"},{"name":"Luigi Paura","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Paura","id":"37282080200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9229-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9230-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9228-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-972X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5657754","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":785},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657754","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Copper","Routing","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobile ad hoc networks","protocols","radio networks","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc cognitive radio networks","ad-hoc on-demand distance vector","CAODV protocol","route formation","packet discovery","channel selection","route cost","cognitive mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive","ad hoc","manet","routing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657754","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAODV: Routing in mobile ad-hoc cognitive radio networks","abstract":"This paper deals with the routing in cognitive mobile ad hoc networks.

Modern systems are able to adjust parameters such as transmission power, modulation, and coding separately for each frequency sub-channel on a very short time scale. This way Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) can be applied, allowing to operate reuse-1 in the center of cells and reuse greater one at cell edges. This paper presents a novel method to analyze the Carrier to Interference Ratio (CIR) distribution and uplink capacity of a cell, from which spectral efficiency of a cellular radio network using FFR is derived. The results presented apply for OFDMA cellular networks operated in IMT-Advanced evaluation scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657764.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink capacity analysis of OFDMA based cellular networks with reuse-1","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Bandwidth","Mathematical model","Fading","Frequency modulation","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink capacity analysis","OFDMA","cellular radio network","fractional frequency reuse","carrier to interference ratio","IMT Advanced"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Uplink capacity analysis of OFDMA based cellular networks with reuse-1","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657764/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688526","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink capacity analysis of OFDMA based cellular networks with reuse-1","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569334815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050461S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657769,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Kadhem Karray","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed Kadhem","lastName":"Karray","id":"37391440100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9229-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9230-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9228-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-972X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5657769","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"abstract":"We study in the present paper the spectral efficiency of OFDMA cellular networks which is a classical indicator of their performance usually calculated by simulations.

We give an explicit expression of the signal to interference and noise power ratio (SINR) as function of the user's location. This permits to calculate easily the cell spectral efficiency, and thus to study its variations with respect to the key parameters of the network such as the cell radius, the propagation characteristics and the single link performance. We show that the energy efficiency admits a maximum for some value of the transmitted power which is finite and nonnull. Moreover, we observe that optimizing the transmitted power permits to double the energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657769.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral and energy efficiencies of OFDMA wireless cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Fading","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","OFDM modulation","radio links","radiofrequency interference","radiowave propagation","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","energy efficiency","OFDMA wireless cellular network","environmental impact","energy consumption","signal-to-interference ratio","noise power ratio","cell radius","cell propagation","link performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Cellular Networks","Spectral efficiency","Energy efficiency","Performance","Power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectral and energy efficiencies of OFDMA wireless cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688473","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral and energy efficiencies of OFDMA wireless cellular networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569334119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093539S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657770,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Felice","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Felice","id":"37540417600"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik Roy","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37317894400"},{"name":"Luciano Bononi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Bononi","id":"37265458500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9229-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9230-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9228-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-972X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5657770","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Sensors","TV","Road transportation","Resource management","Availability","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","vehicular ad hoc networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative cognitive radio technology","intervehicle communication","spectrum efficiency","wireless system","primary user","sensing scheme","PU detection","vehicular environment","cooperative sensing","spectrum allocation","TV channel","vehicular mobility","fading condition","vehicular ad hod network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Systems","Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","Spectrum Sensing","Modeling and Simulation"]}],"abstract":"Recent studies demonstrate that Cognitive Radio (CR) technology can increase the spectrum efficiency of wireless systems, provided that the activity of primary users (PUs) must be carefully protected.

We propose a cooperative sensing and spectrum allocation scheme through which vehicles can share information about spectrum availability of TV channels on their path, and dynamically decide the channels to use on each road segment. Moreover, we investigate the role of vehicular mobility in the cooperation process, which might allow a vehicle to know in advance the spectrum availability on future locations along its path. Simulation results confirm the ability of our scheme in providing robust PU detection under fading conditions, and analyze the impact of some vehicular networks characteristics into the operations of CR systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing the potential of cooperative Cognitive Radio technology on inter-vehicle communication","publicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","doi":"10.1109/WD.2010.5657770","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IFIP Wireless Days","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644810/5657694/05657770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2010.5657770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the potential of cooperative Cognitive Radio technology on inter-vehicle communication","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657770/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688536","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the potential of cooperative Cognitive Radio technology on inter-vehicle communication","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569330000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051572S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644810","isNumber":"5657694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644810","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5657694","articleId":"5657770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657806,"authors":[{"name":"Hojoong An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hojoong","lastName":"An","id":"37589767200"},{"name":"Kyeongrok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongrok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37599502300"},{"name":"Sora Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sora","lastName":"Jung","id":"37596652500"},{"name":"Hyungjun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungjun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596725600"},{"name":"Kyubeom Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyubeom","lastName":"Kim","id":"37599502400"},{"name":"Yunheub Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yunheub","lastName":"Song","id":"37281076800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657806","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluctuations","Doping","Electron traps","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Electron devices","Electric fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","doping profiles","flash memories","NOR circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold voltage fluctuation","one memory cell","NOR flash memory scaling","channel doping level","cell size","random telegraph noise","dopant fluctuation","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Threshold voltage (Vth) fluctuation NOR Flash Memory","Floating Gate","Random Telegraph Noise (Signal)","Tunnel Oxide"]}],"abstract":"The threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) fluctuation for the NOR flash memory scaling is investigated.

aided rank adaptive algorithm for eigen based beamforming in 3GPP-LTE system","abstract":"Reckon for the considerable beamforming gain, eigen-based beamforming (EBB) has been proved to be a promising case to ensure cell edge link robustness. For simplicity, both spatial multiplexing gain and beamforming gain can be obtained with conventional rank adaptive EBB scheme, however, former researches suggest that it doesn't work well at cell edge region. A novel ACK/NAK aided rank adaptive algorithm (AARAA) is proposed for EBB system in this paper with the aim to enhance the spectral efficiency and obtain a Block Error Ratio (BLER) convergence. AARAA employs the HARQ feedback information from previous transmissions as an adjustable factor for rank adaptation, thus the BLER of the first transmissions is controlled in order to lower the retransmission probability and increase resource efficiency. Simulation results show that AARAA can achieve balanced cell average spectrum efficiency and cell edge user spectrum efficiency. Furthermore, AARAA can obtain less BLER than conventional rank adaptive scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657809/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11688579","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657809/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ACK/NAK aided rank adaptive algorithm for eigen based beamforming in 3GPP-LTE system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACK/NAK aided rank adaptive algorithm for eigen based beamforming in 3GPP-LTE system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0093500d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085023S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5657815,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"37598540700"},{"name":"Danpu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danpu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277009500"},{"name":"Xuefeng Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37066184200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657815","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657815","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","MIMO","Protocols","Receivers","Wireless sensor networks","Transmitting antennas","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual V-BLAST transmission scheme","energy efficiency","cluster-based wireless sensor networks","sensor nodes","LEACH protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","energy efficiency","V-BLAST","LEACH"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor network is a promising technique in the near future, but energy-constrained characteristic of sensor nodes is one of the key issues that we must consider in designing.

In this paper we propose two approaches. At first we propose a trust aware model to authenticate the secondary users (SUs) in CRNs which provides a reliable technique to establish trust for CRNs. Secondly, we propose stochastic approach to show the free spectrum availability for SUs in CRNs. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we have modeled and analyzed steady state availability depending on Markov model for free spectrum by adopting QoS characteristics in cognitive radio networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","startPage":"509","endPage":"513","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657819.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Authenticated spectrum sharing for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657819/","displayDocTitle":"Authenticated spectrum sharing for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688580","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authenticated spectrum sharing for secondary users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0104324d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059546S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657829,"authors":[{"name":"Zongyan Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37597759800"},{"name":"Luying Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Luying","lastName":"Li","id":"37600101400"},{"name":"Zhanji Wu","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhanji","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278599100"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657829","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"This paper studies the uplink transmission technique based on Interleave-Division Multiple-Access (IDMA).

The simulation results validate that bit error rate (BER) performance of LDPC codes is improved significantly by using the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657851","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657851.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance optimization of LDPC codes using selective coding approach and beacon parity check matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657851/","displayDocTitle":"Performance optimization of LDPC codes using selective coding approach and beacon parity check matrix","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657851/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688722","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance optimization of LDPC codes using selective coding approach and beacon parity check matrix","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0122499d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037784S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5657853,"authors":[{"name":"Li Fu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Fu","id":"37597090500"},{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597424300"},{"name":"Xiaojun Jing","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37532421600"},{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37593436000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657853","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":849},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of pilot patterns and channel estimation for DVB-T2","abstract":"In this paper the second generation digital terrestrial distribution system standardized by the Digital Video Broadcasting Consortium (DVB-T2) is considered and, in particular, pilot assignments and channel estimation methods for DVB-T2 are discussed. The DVB-T2 standard defines eight different scattered pilot patterns to adjust to different channel conditions. Different scattered pilot patterns to be used for each allowed combination of FFT size and guard interval are investigated. Pilot symbol aided channel estimation based on both Least Square (LS) and Linear Minimum Mean-Square Error (LMMSE) is performed to evaluate the performance of different scattered pilot patterns by measuring the bit error rate (BER). Simulations demonstrate that there is an optimum scattered pilot pattern for a specific channel condition, so an opportunity to choose the optimum pilot pattern to adjust to varying channel conditions dynamically is possible.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657853.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657853","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657853","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657853","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Estimation","Fading","Bit error rate","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot pattern analysis","channel estimation","DVB-T2","second generation digital terrestrial distribution system","digital video broadcasting consortium","scattered pilot patterns","FFT size","least square method","linear minimum mean-square error","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","DVB-T2","pilot pattern","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657853/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of pilot patterns and channel estimation for DVB-T2","accessionNumber":"11688581","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of pilot patterns and channel estimation for DVB-T2","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0124435d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056219S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5657855,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Yu","affiliation":["Broadband Network Monitoring Center, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593340900"},{"name":"Rong Cong","affiliation":["Broadband Network Monitoring Center, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Cong","id":"37587225000"},{"name":"Luying Chen","affiliation":["Broadband Network Monitoring Center, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Luying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37599650200"},{"name":"Zhenming Lei","affiliation":["Broadband Network Monitoring Center, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37280069600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657855","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Matched filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Random access memory","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","information filtering","Internet","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pornographic Web site","illegal Web site","Internet host domain","Bloom filter","Web site blocking","FPGA chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bloom filter","FPGA","Websites blocking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657855","abstract":"For blocking pornographic, illegal websites by Intenet host domain, now the majority of solutions are based on the identification and blocking by software.

First, each bit of serial signal is over-sampled by four times and synchronized, then the transition edges of signal is detected, and finally we select the optimal sampling points to recover out the data that is synchronized with the standard sampling clock.

MIMO signal detection which can provide better bit error rate (BER) performance than linear detection with less computational complexity is indispensable in order to enhance the uplink cellular capacity of multi-user MIMO. Maximum likelihood detection (MLD) employing QR decomposition and M algorithm (QRM-MLD) is one of its candidates. It can reduce the complexity of MLD drastically and obtain BER performance close to MLD. QRM-MLD has been widely studied for MIMO spatial multiplexing using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Recently, it has been reported that QRM-MLD can be applied to the signal detection of single-carrier (SC) transmission in a frequency selective fading channel. In this paper, we introduce the frequency-domain QRM-MLD block signal detection to the SC multi-user MIMO uplink of a cellular system and evaluate the uplink capacity. We show that QRM-MLD can obtain larger uplink cellular capacity compared to the minimum mean square error detection (MMSED) at the cost of the increased computational complexity, but with much less than MLD.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain QRM-MLD block signal detection for single-carrier multi-user MIMO uplink","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657869","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657869.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain QRM-MLD block signal detection for single-carrier multi-user MIMO uplink","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657869/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain QRM-MLD block signal detection for single-carrier multi-user MIMO uplink","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0140461d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070053S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657873,"authors":[{"name":"HyunWook Yang","affiliation":["HY-SDR Research Center, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"HyunWook","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596723400"},{"name":"SeungWon Choi","affiliation":["HY-SDR Research Center, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"SeungWon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292420300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657873","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Modems","Instruction sets","Decoding","Computer architecture","Convolutional codes","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","broadband networks","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiBro system","GPU","communication system","graphic processing unit","system processor","high system throughput","high operation complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","WiBro"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an implementation of a communication system which operates on a realtime basis by using a graphic processing unit (GPU).

Mobile relay station (MRS) is considered as an extension of fixed relay in mobile scenarios such as bus, car and train. Doppler diversity is a diversity technique to improve reliability in highspeed scenario, which has been discussed in recent years. However it is so complicated that may not be suitable and economical for MS. This paper proposes a scheme about the combination of mobile relay station with Doppler diversity in OFDM system communications for high-speed railway scenario. This scheme can provide good quality in relay-MS link in which MS is at low or no velocity. System performance has been evaluated. Several other environments, which include non-relay systems, mobile relay without Doppler diversity system, are considered in this paper to be compared with this scheme. Moreover, fading channel model is analyzed and WINNER II channel model is used as the basic channel model for the simulator.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657879","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657879.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A specific mobile relay with Doppler diversity in OFDM system for high-speed railway scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657879/","displayDocTitle":"A specific mobile relay with Doppler diversity in OFDM system for high-speed railway scenario","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688687","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657879/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A specific mobile relay with Doppler diversity in OFDM system for high-speed railway scenario","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0151269d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0583S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5657889,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Deng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Deng","id":"37593960900"},{"name":"Tao Luo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37277990100"},{"name":"Ran Cai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Cai","id":"37606196200"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Jianfeng Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37292379200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657889","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Power control","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","scheduling","space division multiple access","time division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STDMA throughput enhancement scheme","heuristic scheduling","cognitive radio wireless networks","spatial time-division multiple access based scheme","secondary users","SINR constraint","heuristic spectrum allocation and scheduling algorithm","interference range criterion"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a spatial time-division multiple access (STDMA) based scheme (STBS) to enhance the system throughput in cognitive radio wireless networks.

Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a kind of greedy pursuit algorithms that could implement CS signal recovery. However, in distributed compressed sensing (DCS) scenario, an emerging field based on the correlation among sources, original OMP has to be modified in order to satisfy the limited power restrictions. In this paper, by considering the reconstructed signal as side information (SI), we propose a new jointly decoding algorithm based on OMP and deduce the theoretical measurement rate of each signal. Compared with conventional decoding algorithms, a certain amount of saving in time and number of measurements is obtained and illustrated in the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657901","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Side information based orthogonal matching pursuit in distributed compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Side information based orthogonal matching pursuit in distributed compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657901/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688659","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5657901/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Side information based orthogonal matching pursuit in distributed compressed sensing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0017513d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069134S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5657903,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Information Theory and Technology Teaching & Research Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Li","id":"37598984300"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Information Theory and Technology Teaching & Research Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657903","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a two phase RAT selection strategy based on network load and SIR for CDMA-OFDMA heterogeneous networks. The strategy divides the RAT selection into two phases. The functionality of the first phase is to balance the network load while the second phase aims to improve the downlink SIR. The analytical expressions of the parameters used in the proposed strategy are derived and the performance is evaluated by numerical simulation. The results are presented in terms of downlink SIR outage probability. It is shown that this strategy can not only balance the network load, but also improve the SIR significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657903.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two phase RAT selection strategy based on network load and SIR for CDMA-OFDMA heterogeneous networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Load management","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Numerical simulation","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","frequency division multiple access","interference (signal)","numerical analysis","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two phase RAT selection strategy","network load","CDMA-OFDMA heterogeneous networks","downlink SIR","numerical simulation","radio access technology","signal to interference ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRRM","RAT selection","CDMA","OFDMA","SIR","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A two phase RAT selection strategy based on network load and SIR for CDMA-OFDMA heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657903/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688717","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two phase RAT selection strategy based on network load and SIR for CDMA-OFDMA heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0019334d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051535S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5657911,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597883400"},{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600972900"},{"name":"Jun Guo","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277255800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657911","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Acoustics","Speech recognition","Training","Hidden Markov models","Probability","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active learning sample evaluation method","multilevel confusion networks","labor-intensive process","speech recognition","informative training samples","manual annotation","Chinese acoustic modeling","word posterior probability","word confusion network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning","confusion network","acoustic model","speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657911","abstract":"Active Learning (AL) is designed to aid the labor-intensive process of training acoustic model for speech recognition.

Furthermore, residual under-compensated dispersion per span is beneficial to CO-OFDM, the drop in maximum Q varies from 3.2 dB to 1.2 dB as the residual dispersion increases from 0 to 700 ps/nm compared with no inline compensation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inline dispersion compensation effect for 100GB/S PDM-CO-OFDM long-haul transmission systems","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657925","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05657925.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5657925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5657925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Inline dispersion compensation effect for 100GB/S PDM-CO-OFDM long-haul transmission systems","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5657925/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688733","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inline dispersion compensation effect for 100GB/S PDM-CO-OFDM long-haul transmission systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0182057d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04801S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5657925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5657938,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37066451200"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yuanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Gang Xie","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37305624300"},{"name":"Panliang Deng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Panliang","lastName":"Deng","id":"37604436400"},{"name":"Junling Mao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Junling","lastName":"Mao","id":"37596588600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5657938","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Pricing","Distributed algorithms","Iterative algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","interference suppression","MIMO communication","pricing","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equilibrium efficiency","MIMO interference channel","pricing","Nash equilibrium","distributed algorithm","KKT","price function","interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO interference channel","game theory","pricing","Nash equilibrium","iterative waterfilling"]}],"abstract":"A Nash equilibrium exists in the MIMO interference channel where users maximize their rates in a fully competitive manner.

This fault model is valid for CMOS process technologies that exhibit field-oxide leakage current under total dose. The fault model was represented using hardware descriptive languages which consequently allowed for cell-level simulation of ASIC devices under total dose using functional simulation tools normally used during the design flow of ASIC devices. However, the identification of worst-case test vectors using those tools using automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools targeting the fault model developed. This can lead to prohibitively long search time for WCTV in large ASIC devices. We developed an innovative search method based on genetic algorithms (GA) which made possible the identification of WCTV for large ASIC devices in very short time. Finally, we experimentally validated the significance of WCTV in total dose testing of ASIC devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear

A third-generation SiGe HBT IMC device was tested in a time resolved ion beam induced charge collection (TRIBICC) system, and was found to have over a 75% reduction in peak current transients with the use of an n-Tiedown on the IMC sub-collector node. Digital shift registers in a 1st-generation SiGe HBT technology were designed and measured under a heavy-ion beam, and shown to increase the LET threshold over standard npn only shift registers. Using the CREME96 tool, the expected orbital bit-errors/day were simulated to be approximately 70% lower with the IMC shift register.

SEL observed at 24 K and below is believed to be possible when free carriers produced by an ion strike initiate an exponential increase in the free carrier density via shallow-level impact ionization (SLII). This results in a large current increase that proceeds to a sustained latched state, even though the classic condition for parasitic bipolar gain product is not met since it is much less than unity. The LET threshold for SEL is significantly lower at 20 K as compared to 300 K although the saturated cross section is 2-3 times higher at 300 K. The temperature dependence of the SEL cross section is characterized from 16-300 K. SEL behavior attributed to the classical cross-coupled parasitic bipolar model is observed from ~135-300 K, and the reduction in the SEL cross section is remarkably modest as the temperature is lowered from room temperature to ~200 K. Temperature dependent electrical latchup characterization of a 130 nm pnpn test structure also indicates a change in the latchup behavior at ~50 K consistent with the SLII mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2085018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5657993/05658023.pdf","startPage":"3078","endPage":"3086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2085018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanisms and Temperature Dependence of Single Event Latchup Observed in a CMOS Readout Integrated Circuit From 16\u2013300 K","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mechanisms and Temperature Dependence of Single Event Latchup Observed in a CMOS Readout Integrated Circuit From 16\u2013300 K","volume":"57","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5658023/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658023/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanisms and Temperature Dependence of Single Event Latchup Observed in a CMOS Readout Integrated Circuit From 16\u2013300 K","sourcePdf":"tns-marshall-2085018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086443S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5657993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5657993","articleId":"5658023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5658028,"authors":[{"name":"Yubo Li","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Yubo","lastName":"Li","id":"37598930200"},{"name":"Brent Nelson","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37291594100"},{"name":"Michael Wirthlin","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wirthlin","id":"37283898600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5658028","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1084},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Reliability","Single event upset"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic testing","radiation hardening (electronics)","redundancy","reliability","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization techniques","multiple clock domains","FPGA-based TMR circuits","triple modular redundancy","mitigation technique","single event upsets","SEU","asynchronous sampling effects","failure modes","fault injection testing","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","reliability","single event upset","synchronizer","triple modular redundancy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658028","abstract":"Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is a widely used mitigation technique to protect FPGA circuits against single event upsets (SEUs). TMR, however, does not adequately protect signals that cross asynchronous clock domains. Signals which cross clock domains in TMR circuits may suffer from the combined effects of two failure modes: asynchronous sampling effects and SEUs. This paper analyzes and quantifies these problems. In addition, various solutions are proposed for designing safe synchronizers with TMR. Finally, the improvements in reliability provided by the proposed synchronizers are demonstrated by both mathematical modeling and fault injection testing on an FPGA circuit. It is shown that the proposed mitigated synchronizer designs provide between 6 and 10 orders of magnitude improvement in reliability compared to unmitigated designs.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2086075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5657993/05658028.pdf","startPage":"3506","endPage":"3514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2086075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization Techniques for Crossing Multiple Clock Domains in FPGA-Based TMR Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization Techniques for Crossing Multiple Clock Domains in FPGA-Based TMR Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693015","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization Techniques for Crossing Multiple Clock Domains in FPGA-Based TMR Circuits","sourcePdf":"tns-li-2086075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041261S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"5657993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5658028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658031,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P.

Rad-hard NVMs offer radiation hardness, but are available only in small size (few Mbits).

The detector is designed to collect X-rays scattered from monochromatic femtosecond pulses produced by the LCLS X-ray laser at framing rates up to 120 Hz. Because X-rays will arrive on femtosecond time scales, the detector must be able to deal with instantaneous count-rates in excess of 1017 photons per second per pixel. A low-noise integrating front-end allows the detector to simultaneously distinguish single photon events in low-flux regions of the diffraction pattern, while recording up to several thousand X-rays per pixel in more intense regions. The detector features a per-pixel programmable two-level gain control that can be used to create an arbitrary 2-D, two-level gain pattern across the detector; massively parallel 14-bit in-pixel digitization; and frame rates in excess of 120 Hz. The first full-scale detector will be 1516 x 1516 pixels with a pixel size of 110 X 110 microns made by tiling CMOS ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) that are bump-bonded to high-resistivity silicon diodes. X-ray testing data of the first 185 X 194 pixel bump-bonded ASICs is presented. These are tiled to make the final detector. The measurements presented include confirmation of single photon sensitivity, pixel response profiles indicating a nearly single-pixel point spread function, radiation damage measurements and noise performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2085445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5658062/05658071.pdf","startPage":"3795","endPage":"3799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2085445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond Radiation Experiment Detector for X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) Coherent X-Ray Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658071/","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond Radiation Experiment Detector for X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) Coherent X-Ray Imaging","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693063","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5658071/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond Radiation Experiment Detector for X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) Coherent X-Ray Imaging","sourcePdf":"tns-philipp-2085445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055563S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5658062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5658062","articleId":"5658071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658083,"authors":[{"name":"Gennady Ivanovich Zebrev","affiliation":["MEPHI, National Research Nuclear University, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Gennady Ivanovich","lastName":"Zebrev","id":"37062724600"},{"name":"Igor Olegovich Ishutin","affiliation":["MEPHI, National Research Nuclear University, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Igor Olegovich","lastName":"Ishutin","id":"37593996200"},{"name":"Rustem Galeyevich Useinov","affiliation":["Research Institute of Scientific Instruments, Lytkarino, Moscow Region, Russia"],"firstName":"Rustem Galeyevich","lastName":"Useinov","id":"37352702600"},{"name":"Vasily Sergeyevich Anashin","affiliation":["JSC Institute of Space Device Engineering, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Vasily Sergeyevich","lastName":"Anashin","id":"38179708900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5658083","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Bit error rate","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","integrated circuit testing","nuclear reactions and scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft error rate computation","modern microelectronics","angular cross-section dependence","equivalence","phenomenological distribution averaging","chord-length distribution averaging","energy-loss straggling","subthreshold error rate enhancement","nuclear reaction induced error rate computation method","BGR","chord-length approaches","multiple bit error rate estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy deposition","LET","multiple bit error","nuclear reactions","sensitive volume","soft error rate","straggling"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed a test methodology based on successive experimental determination of angular cross-section dependence followed by averaging over full solid angle.

SPADs are p-n junction biased above the breakdown voltage and operate in Geiger-mode: each electron-hole pair can trigger an avalanche multiplication process that causes the current to swiftly rise to its final value. Additional quenching electronics is necessary for a SPAD proper working. The additional electronics characteristics directly affect the system's obtainable performances. Different quenching circuits affect the detector performances in different ways. In the last 15 years there has been considerable development in the integration of the quenching circuitry directly with the detector, thus leading to improved performances.

By placing a 45\u00b0 Faraday rotator in front of the RSOA in the optical network unit, the state-of-polarization of the upstream signal becomes orthogonal to that of the linearly polarized seed light at the input of the coherent receiver regardless of the birefringence in the transmission link. Thus, we can achieve the polarization stability of the upstream signal at the input of the coherent receiver. We first implement a self-homodyne receiver by using the proposed self-polarization-stabilization technique and measure its sensitivity by using 2.5-Gb/s binary phase-shift keying signals in the laboratory. The result shows an excellent receiver sensitivity of -46.4 dBm. We also confirm the efficacy of the proposed technique in the transmission experiment over 68-km long link partially composed of installed (buried and aerial) fibers. No significant degradation in the receiver sensitivity is observed during the 10-h experiment despite the large polarization fluctuations occurred in these installed fibers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5703205/05658088.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2096800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2096800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5703205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-Reach Coherent WDM PON Employing Self-Polarization-Stabilization Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical receivers","Optical fiber polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["birefringence","Faraday effect","laser beams","optical fibre polarisation","optical receivers","passive optical networks","phase shift keying","semiconductor optical amplifiers","stability","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-reach coherent WDM PON","self-polarization stabilization technique","wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network","reflective semiconductor optical amplifier","self-homodyne coherent receiver","Faraday rotator","RSOA","upstream signal polarization","linearly polarized seed light","birefringence","transmission link","polarization stability","phase-shift keying signal","receiver sensitivity","installed fibers","buried fibers","aerial fibers","polarization fluctuations","bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s","time 10 h"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent receiver","polarization","reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA)","wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (WDM PON)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Long-Reach Coherent WDM PON Employing Self-Polarization-Stabilization Technique","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5658088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"11809227","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-Reach Coherent WDM PON Employing Self-Polarization-Stabilization Technique","sourcePdf":"jlt-cho-2096800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089907S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5703205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5703205","articleId":"5658088","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658099,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The paper will first discuss the energy efficiency metrics that should include considerations for life-cycle analysis, applications, and network-wide goodput. The state-of-the-art electronic packet switching router is currently energy-limited in scalability as it is difficult to implement a router with more than 1 MW power consumption. The OPS router that imitates electronic router's store-and-forward schemes is expected to suffer poor energy efficiency due to the complexity in the high-speed control plane necessary to control many optical buffer stages. The hybrid optical router achieves easier buffer management but its energy efficiency is still limited by the store-and-forward approach. The OPS router based on all-optical contention resolution without relying on store-and-forward method can keep the control plane very simple and achieve very high energy efficiency. Network-wide performance and energy efficiency in the context of generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS)- and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)-based networking are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2076793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5743095/05658099.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5743095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2076793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"406","endPage":"418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: The Role of Optical Packet Switching and Optical-Label Switching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: The Role of Optical Packet Switching and Optical-Label Switching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658099/","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5658099/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11911246","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency in the Future Internet: The Role of Optical Packet Switching and Optical-Label Switching","sourcePdf":"jstqe-yoo-2076793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146356S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5743095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5743095","articleId":"5658099","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5658102,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Villa","affiliation":["GIPSA-Laboratory, Signal & Image Department, Grenoble Institute of Technology INP, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5767682/5658102/5658102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Villa (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Hyperspectral imaging is a continuously growing area of remote sensing applications. The wide spectral range of such imagery, providing a very high spectral resolution, allows to detect and classify surfaces and chemical elements of the observed image. The main problem of hyperspectral data is the (relatively) low spatial resolution, which can vary from a few to tens of meters. Many factors make the spatial resolution one of the most expensive and hardest to improve in imaging systems. For classification, the major problem caused by low spatial resolution are the mixed pixels, i.e., parts of the image where more than one land cover map lie in the same pixel. In this paper, we propose a method to address the problem of mixed pixels and to obtain a finer spatial resolution of the land cover classification maps. The method exploits the advantages of both soft classification techniques and spectral unmixing algorithms, in order to determine the fractional abundances of the classes at a sub-pixel scale. Spatial regularization by simulated annealing is finally performed to spatially locate the obtained classes. Experiments carried out on synthetic real data sets show excellent results both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5767682/05658102.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2096798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2096798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Unmixing for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images at a Finer Spatial Resolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Spatial resolution","Hyperspectral imaging","Support vector machines","Probabilistic logic","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","image resolution","remote sensing","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification","finer spatial resolution","remote sensing","spectral resolution","chemical elements","land cover classification maps","spectral unmixing algorithms","spatial regularization","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral data","simulated annealing","source separation","spatial regularization","spatial resolution improvement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Unmixing for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images at a Finer Spatial Resolution","volume":"5","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5658102/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12004766","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Unmixing for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images at a Finer Spatial Resolution","sourcePdf":"jstsp-villa-2096798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134508S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5767682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5767682","articleId":"5658102","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658103,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5689326/5658103/5658103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang, (S'89\u2013SM'98) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, the M.S. degree from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, all in electrical engineering and computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (electrical engineering-systems) from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Founding Director of the Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station.

However, there are many new challenges associated with cognitive-radio-based DSA networks, such as the multi-channel hidden terminal problem and the fact that the time-varying channel availability differs for different secondary users, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient Cognitive Radio-EnAbled Multi-channel MAC (CREAM-MAC) protocol, which integrates the cooperative sequential spectrum sensing at physical layer and the packet scheduling at MAC layer, over the wireless DSA networks. Under the proposed CREAM-MAC protocol, each secondary user is equipped with a cognitive radio-enabled transceiver and multiple channel sensors. Our cooperative sequential spectrum sensing scheme improves the accuracy of spectrum sensing and further protects the primary users. The proposed CREAM-MAC enables the secondary users to best utilize the unused frequency spectrum while avoiding the collisions among secondary users and between secondary users and primary users.

An adaptive filter that is not properly regularized will perform very poorly. In spite of this, regularization in our opinion is underestimated and rarely discussed in the literature of adaptive filtering. There are, very likely, many different ways to regularize an adaptive filter. In this paper, we propose one possible way to do it based on a condition that intuitively makes sense. From this condition, we show how to regularize four important algorithms: the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS), the signed-regressor NLMS (SR-NLMS), the improved proportionate NLMS (IPNLMS), and the SR-IPNLMS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language

By simply replacing the cyclic delay line with a retriggerable ring oscillator for accuracy enhancement, modifying the gain of time amplifier from fixed to variable for one-point calibration support and adopting a second-order master curve for curvature correction in this paper, the proposed smart temperature sensor can achieve two thirds reduction in circuit size, at least four-fold improvement in power consumption and more than two-fold enhancement in accuracy. To demonstrate the performance under practical process variation, the sensor realized with as few as 48 FPGA logic elements for rapid prototyping was measured over 0\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C range for 20 test chips from batches spreading over 4 years. The measured inaccuracy is -0.7\u00b0C-+0.6\u00b0C which is superior to -1.8\u00b0C-+2.3\u00b0C of its full-custom predecessor with a third-order master curve and five test samples from one single batch. The accuracy is even better than those of full-custom sensors with two-point calibration. The conversion rate is around 4.4 kHz and the power consumption can be reduced to 175 nJ per conversion by increasing the number of delay stages in ring oscillator to 4608.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5756263/05658138.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2090567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2090567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5756263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Digital Time-Domain Smart Temperature Sensor With an Inter-Batch Inaccuracy of - After One-Point Calibration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature sensors","Calibration","Temperature measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Accuracy","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","calibration","field programmable gate arrays","intelligent sensors","oscillators","temperature sensors","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-digital time-domain smart temperature sensor","one-point calibration","full-custom design","mixed-mode design","field programmable gate array logic elements","FPGA logic elements","VLSI on-chip integration","cyclic delay line","retriggerable ring oscillator","accuracy enhancement","time amplifier","second-order master curve","curvature correction","power consumption","third-order master curve","temperature -0.7 degC to 0.6 degC","temperature -1.8 degC to 2.3 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","fully digital","smart temperature sensor","time-domain","variable-gain time amplifier (VGTA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"All-Digital Time-Domain Smart Temperature Sensor With an Inter-Batch Inaccuracy of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-{\\hbox {0.7}} ~^{\\circ}{\\hbox {C}}-+{\\hbox {0.6}}~^{\\circ}{\\hbox {C}}$</tex></formula> After One-Point Calibration","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5658138/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972014","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Digital Time-Domain Smart Temperature Sensor With an Inter-Batch Inaccuracy of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-{\\hbox {0.7}} ~^{\\circ}{\\hbox {C}}-+{\\hbox {0.6}}~^{\\circ}{\\hbox {C}}$</tex></formula> After One-Point Calibration","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2090567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088686S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5756263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5756263","articleId":"5658138","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658141,"authors":[{"name":"Fitiwi Desta Zahlay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Tronoh, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Fitiwi Desta","lastName":"Zahlay","id":"37593832500"},{"name":"K.

A variety of fault simulations are carried out on a specified transmission line on the standard IEEE 9-bus electric power system using MATLAB/SimPowerSytems.

The fault identification prior to reclosing is accomplished by an artificial neural network trained by standard Error Back-Propagation, Levenberg Marquardt, and Resilient Back-Propagation algorithms which are developed using MATLAB. Some important parameters which strongly affect the entire training process are fine tuned with Taguchi's method to their corresponding best values. The robustness of the developed ANN identifier is verified by testing it with the data patterns which consists of high impedance faults obtained from IEEE 14-bus benchmark system. Test results show the efficacy of the proposed AR scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2090936","startPage":"306","endPage":"313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5688725/05658141.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2090936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Intelligent Autoreclosing Scheme Using Artificial Neural Network and Taguchi's Methodology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Circuit faults","Power transmission lines","Feature extraction","Training","Transient analysis","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent autoreclosing scheme","artificial neural network","Taguchi methodology","permanent faults","fault extinction time","IEEE 9-bus electric power system","MATLAB-SimPowerSytem","FFT","Prony analysis method","data feature extraction","impedance faults","IEEE 14-bus benchmark system","fault simulations","transmission line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive automatic reclosure","artificial neural networks (ANNs)","Error Back Propagation (EBP)","Levenberg Marquardt (LM)","Resilient Back-Propagation","Taguchi's method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Intelligent Autoreclosing Scheme Using Artificial Neural Network and Taguchi's Methodology","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11759951","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Intelligent Autoreclosing Scheme Using Artificial Neural Network and Taguchi's Methodology","sourcePdf":"tia-ramarao-2090936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062027S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5688725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5658141","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":5658142,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5712892/5658142/5658142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arun Abraham Ross (S'00\u2013M'03) received the B.E.

This work explores the possibility of using visual cryptography for imparting privacy to biometric data such as fingerprint images, iris codes, and face images. In the case of faces, a private face image is dithered into two host face images (known as sheets) that are stored in two separate database servers such that the private image can be revealed only when both sheets are simultaneously available; at the same time, the individual sheet images do not reveal the identity of the private image. A series of experiments on the XM2VTS and IMM face databases confirm the following: 1) the possibility of hiding a private face image in two host face images; 2) the successful matching of face images reconstructed from the sheets; 3) the inability of sheets to reveal the identity of the private face image; 4) using different pairs of host images to encrypt different samples of the same private face; and 5) the difficulty of cross-database matching for determining identities. A similar process is used to de-identify fingerprint images and iris codes prior to storing them in a central database.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658142/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5658142/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11807329","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Visual Cryptography for Biometric Privacy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Cryptography for Biometric Privacy","sourcePdf":"tifs-othman-2097252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083864S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5712892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5712892","articleId":"5658142","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5658143,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsan Tavakoli-Kakhki","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahsan","lastName":"Tavakoli-Kakhki","id":"38318091300"},{"name":"Mohammad Haeri","affiliation":["Control System Laboratory, Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Haeri","id":"37294533600"},{"name":"Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Saleh","lastName":"Tavazoei","id":"37399478000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"5658143","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":936},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transfer functions","Aerospace electronics","Capacitors","Control systems","Equations","Approximation methods","Observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rational functions","state-space methods","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state space realizations","rational order transfer functions","integer order systems","lower bounds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional order system","minimal realization","rational order transfer function","state space realization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the concept of minimal state space realization for a fractional order system is defined from the inner dimension point of view.

Also, the concept of optimal realization, which can be a helpful concept in practice, is introduced for transfer functions having rational orders.

The dynamic clustering control is adaptive to the global queue state information (GQSI) only and computed at the base station controller (BSC) over a longer time scale. On the other hand, the power allocations of all the BSs in each cluster are adaptive to both intracluster channel state information (CCSI) and intracluster queue state information (CQSI), and computed at each cluster manager (CM) over a shorter time scale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control can be formulated as an infinite-horizon average cost constrained partially observed Markov decision process (CPOMDP). By exploiting the special problem structure, we derive an equivalent Bellman equation in terms of pattern selection Q-factor to solve the CPOMDP. To address the distributed requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the pattern selection Q-factor by the sum of per-cluster potential functions and propose a novel distributed online learning algorithm to estimate them distributedly. We show that the proposed distributed online learning algorithm converges almost surely. By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we further decompose the per-cluster potential function into the sum of per-cluster per-user potential functions and formulate the instantaneous power allocation as a per-stage QSI-aware interference game played among all the CMs. The proposed QSI-aware simultaneous iterative water-filling algorithm (QSIWFA) is shown to achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE).","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2097253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05658162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2097253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queue-Aware Dynamic Clustering and Power Allocation for Network MIMO Systems via Distributed Stochastic Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Queue-Aware Dynamic Clustering and Power Allocation for Network MIMO Systems via Distributed Stochastic Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11805202","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5658162/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue-Aware Dynamic Clustering and Power Allocation for Network MIMO Systems via Distributed Stochastic Learning","sourcePdf":"tsp-cui-2097253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113948S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5658162","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658165,"authors":[{"name":"Shinji Shinnaka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5871429/5658165/5658165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shinji Shinnaka (S\u201977\u2013M\u201979) received the Graduate degree from the National Defense Academy, Yokosuka, Japan, in 1973, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Irvine, in 1977 and 1979, respectively, and the Dr.Eng. degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1990.","After serving with the First Research Institute, Japan Defense Agency, and the Department of Electrical Engineering, the National Defense Academy, he was with Canon, Inc., as the Head of several research laboratories, from 1986 to1991.

Our theoretical results are then compared with accurate simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5676420/05658166.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotary Traveling-Wave Oscillators, Analysis and Simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658166/","displayDocTitle":"Rotary Traveling-Wave Oscillators, Analysis and Simulation","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727775","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5658166/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotary Traveling-Wave Oscillators, Analysis and Simulation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pedrotti-2071710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101235S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5676420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5676420","articleId":"5658166","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658170,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Fortunati","affiliation":["Department of Ingegneria dell'Informazione, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5658170/5658170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Fortunati (S'10) graduated (cum laude) in telecommunication engineering at the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2008.","In 2009, he joined the Department of Ingegneria dell'Informazione of the University of Pisa, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in information engineering.

The proposed coprocessor has been implemented and tested in Xilinx Spartan-3A DSP XC3SD3400A, and also validated using the standard-cell-based approach in IBM 0.13 \u03bcm technology. To implement an entire speech recognition system, SAMSUNG S3C44b0X (containing an ARM7) is used as the micro-controller to execute the rest of speech processing. Tested with a 358-state 3-mixture 27-feature 800-word HMM, S3C44b0X operates at 40 MHz and coprocessor at 10 MHz to meet the real-time requirement, and the recognition accuracy is 95.2%.

Since the problem of finding the optimal network code maximizing the bandwidth efficiency is hard to solve and hard to approximate, two main network coding heuristic schemes, namely opportunistic and full network coding, were suggested in the literature to improve the MBS bandwidth efficiency. However, each of these two schemes usually outperforms the other in different receiver, demand, and feedback settings. The continuous and rapid change of these settings in wireless networks limits the bandwidth efficiency gains if only one scheme is always employed. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme that maintains the highest bandwidth efficiency obtainable by both opportunistic and full network coding schemes in wireless MBS. The proposed scheme adaptively selects, between these two schemes, the one that is expected to achieve the better bandwidth efficiency performance. The core contribution in this adaptive selection scheme lies in our derivation of performance metrics for opportunistic network coding, using random graph theory, which achieves efficient selection when compared to appropriate full network coding parameters. To compare between different complexity levels, we present three approaches to compute the performance metric for opportunistic coding using different levels of knowledge about the opportunistic coding graph. For the three considered approaches, simulation results show that our proposed scheme almost achieves the bandwidth efficiency performance that could be obtained by the optimal selection between the opportunistic and full coding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2091652","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5875977/05658178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2091652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875977","startPage":"869","endPage":"878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Network Coded Retransmission Scheme for Single-Hop Wireless Multicast Broadcast Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Network Coded Retransmission Scheme for Single-Hop Wireless Multicast Broadcast Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12060303","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5658178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Network Coded Retransmission Scheme for Single-Hop Wireless Multicast Broadcast Services","sourcePdf":"tnet-sorour-2091652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099789S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5875977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5875977","articleId":"5658178","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658180,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxia Wu","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoxia","lastName":"Wu","id":"38558051900"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38556706100"},{"name":"Mark Nakamoto","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Nakamoto","id":"38557074100"},{"name":"Chandra Nimmagadda","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chandra","lastName":"Nimmagadda","id":"38558523900"},{"name":"Durodami Lisk","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Durodami","lastName":"Lisk","id":"37593813200"},{"name":"Sam Gu","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Gu","id":"37532256000"},{"name":"Riko Radojcic","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Riko","lastName":"Radojcic","id":"38559508200"},{"name":"Matt Nowak","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37404450300"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennslyvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"38557027200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5658180","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Capacitance","Delay","Substrates","Integrated circuit interconnections","Metals","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical characterization","vertical intertier connections","timing analysis","3D IC","interconnect delay","power consumption","deep submicron designs","3D technologies","through silicon via","microbumps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microbumps","3-D integration","through silicon via"]}],"abstract":"Reducing interconnect delay and power consumption has become a major concern in deep submicron designs. 3-D technologies have been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate interconnect problems.

It is well-known that the variations of illumination mainly affect the large-scale features (low-frequency components), and not so much the small-scale features. Therefore, in relevant existing methods only the small-scale features are extracted as illumination-invariant features for face recognition, while the large-scale intrinsic features are always ignored. In this paper, we argue that both large-and small-scale features of a face image are important for face restoration and recognition. Moreover, we suggest that illumination normalization should be performed mainly on the large-scale features of a face image rather than on the original face image. A novel method of normalizing both the Small-and Large-scale (S&L) features of a face image is proposed. In this method, a single face image is first decomposed into large-and small-scale features. After that, illumination normalization is mainly performed on the large-scale features, and only a minor correction is made on the small-scale features. Finally, a normalized face image is generated by combining the processed large-and small-scale features. In addition, an optional visual compensation step is suggested for improving the visual quality of the normalized image. Experiments on CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and FRGC 2.0 face databases show that by using the proposed method significantly better recognition performance and visual results can be obtained as compared to related state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5876607/05658185.pdf","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2097270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2097270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876607","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalization of Face Illumination Based on Large-and Small-Scale Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Visualization","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image restoration","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face illumination","large-scale features","small-scale features","face image","low-frequency components","face recognition","face restoration","CMU-PIE","Yale B","FRGC 2.0 face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","illumination normalization","visual compensation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometric Identification","Face","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Principal Component Analysis","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Normalization of Face Illumination Based on Large-and Small-Scale Features","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5658185/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063091","pubMedId":"21138805","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalization of Face Illumination Based on Large-and Small-Scale Features","sourcePdf":"tip-lai-2097270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162236S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5876607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5876607","articleId":"5658185","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5658220,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Equipment & System Security and New Technology, Department of High Voltage and Insulation Engineering, College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5658211/5658220/5658220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Li (M'05) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 1997 and 2001, respectively from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

In the proposed energy criterion, a base wavelet is selected as an optimal base wavelet if it can generate an approximation with the largest energy among all base wavelets for selection at each scale. PD high-frequency signals are simulated and PD ultra-high-frequency signals are obtained by experiments in laboratory for de-noising experiments and analysis.

Oxyfluorination led to the substantial variations in chemical composition, forming large numbers of various polar groups in the surface layers, depending on oxyfluorination time, as indicated by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) analyses. Space charge measurements based on the pressure wave propagation method revealed obvious dependence of the charge injection and accumulation on oxyfluorination time when the samples were submitted to an average direct current field of about 50 kV/mm at 40\u00b0C. Suppression of the charge injection and accumulation by the oxyfluorinated surface layer was enhanced with extending oxyfluorination time. The total amounts of the positive and negative charges within the samples oxyfluorinated for 1, 6, and 13 h were calculated to be around 67, 50, and 29% of the total amount in the original sample, respectively. Diffusion of the volatile byproducts within the EVA electrode into LLDPE was evidenced by the ATR-IR analyses or indirectly by open-circuit thermally stimulated discharge current measurements. The diffusion influenced the charge injection and accumulation by changing charge traps in the surface layer and the field assisted ionization of the diffused volatile byproducts, and was influenced by the surface oxyfluorination depending on the treatment time. The influences of oxyfluorination on charge injection and accumulation were attributed to the remarkable increase in surface layer permittivity and the changes in its charge trap and barrier property to the diffusion of volatile by-products. The change in surface layer permittivity was indirectly evaluated by surface energy calculations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical

(DLSAOP) is studied. Three C2 organization decision layer structure (DLS) performance measures, including decision workload, decision quality and decision gain, are presented. Then a constrained optimization model for DLSAOP is established. DLSAOP is a novel combinational optimization problem with strong constraints and two variants. A nested improved simulated annealing (NISA) algorithm is designed for the problem. The standard simulated annealing (SA) algorithm has shortcomings of poor convergence, local repeatedly searching and early stagnation under strong constraints, for which diversified temperature controlling, tabu object and evaluation function containing items of constraint-violate-punishment are incorporated into NISA. A nesting approach is presented to combine the two improved SA algorithms for the two variants. At last, the computational experiment illustrates that DLSAOP modeling and optimization can remarkably improve DLS performance and the result of NISA has better quality and stability than other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658279/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11692145","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5658279/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The adaptive optimization of C2 organization decision layer structure based on nested improved simulated annealing algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The adaptive optimization of C2 organization decision layer structure based on nested improved simulated annealing algorithm","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3014211546d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095359S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","xplore-issue":"5658258","articleId":"5658279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5658283,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoyu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Shaoyu Wang","id":"37599724000"},{"name":"Xiaoling Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoling Xia","id":"37555055800"},{"name":"Jiajin Le","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jiajin Le","id":"37399630400"},{"name":"Songshao Yang","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Fukong Hualong Microsystem Technology Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Songshao Yang","id":"37598415500"},{"name":"Xiaoyong Liao","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Fukong Hualong Microsystem Technology Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyong Liao","id":"37588699700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658283","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"abstract":"Children are usually treated differently from adults in many computer vision applications.

Currently, researchers always use orthogonal wavelet to represent the images. But the wavelet only has single scaling function and can not simultaneously satisfy the orthogonality, high vanishing moments, compact support, symmetry characteristic and regularity. Developed from the theory of wavelet, multi-wavelet transform, which can simultaneously satisfy the five characteristics, provides a great potential to obtain high-performance coding. According to the three main steps (Sparse representation, measurement matrix, reconstruction algorithm) of compressive sensing image reconstruction, this paper proposes a compressive sensing image reconstruction based on sparse representation of the image in multi-wavelet transform domain while using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit iterative as the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results show that the reconstructed image has batter vision quality and a good performance on PSNR. Meanwhile, the algorithm of reconstruction gets a faster convergence rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658507","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639100/5658307/05658507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658307","startPage":"702","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing of image reconstruction using multi-wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing of image reconstruction using multi-wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658507/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692399","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5658507/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing of image reconstruction using multi-wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"1015310551d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066098S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5658307","articleId":"5658507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5658508,"authors":[{"name":"Yingxin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yingxin Zhao","id":"37403488200"},{"name":"Lijun Ge","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Lijun Ge","id":"37405619800"},{"name":"Shuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Shuang Wang","id":"37599722500"},{"name":"Yuang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yuang Jin","id":"37534838600"},{"name":"Minhao Fu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Minhao Fu","id":"37590724400"},{"name":"Hong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Hong Wu","id":"37405486700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658508","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","AWGN","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","error statistics","OFDM modulation","sigma-delta modulation","synchronisation","timing","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB OFDM signal conversion","multibit discrete time sigma-delta converter","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wide band systems","IEEE 802.15.3a standard","ECMA368 standard","timing synchronization algorithm","third-order low pass modulator","fourth-order band pass modulator","maximum correlation method","minimum energy ratio method","noise shaping","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sigma-delta","UWB","OFDM","analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter","timing synchronization"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multi-bit discrete time sigma-delta converter for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wide band systems adopted by IEEE 802.15.3a and ECMA368 standard.

As a precondition for generalized K distribution(GK) clutter model, the speckle component and the amplitude modulated component should obey the generalized Gamma distribution, Parameter estimation for Generalized K distribution clutter model has high dimensional, nonlinear and other issues. This paper researches the parameter estimation for GK model based on improved particle swarm optimization.

One improved PF algorithm with weights optimization is to use the optimal idea to improve the weights after implementing PSR resampling so as to enhance the performance of PF. The other PF algorithm based on adaptive mutation resampling is also to use the weights optimal idea for dominant or negligible particles in order to improve the resampling performance before implementing PSR resampling; and used the mutation operation for all particles so as to assure the diversity of particle sets. At the same time, the adaptive resampling mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of PF.

To solve this problem, a self adaptive composite control scheme is developed to control the flexible joint robots with modeling errors and subject to uncertain disturbances, which is based on considering the system as a low dimensional nominal rigid and a linear elastic subsystem. Using this approach, the controller consists of a slow and a fast term, the slow control is based on the well-known Computed Torque method and a RBF neural network based compensating controller. The neural network is trained on line based on Lyapunov theory to compensate for the modeling uncertainties, thus its convergence is guaranteed. The fast term is designed to provide stiffness and damping for eliminating elastic deformation. Simulations are presented for a planner manipulator with two flexible joints, the trajectory tracking results are provided to demonstrate performance of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658637","startPage":"837","endPage":"840","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639100/5658255/05658637.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-adaptive composite control for flexible joint robot based on RBF neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Robots","Actuators","Damping","Acceleration","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","damping","flexible manipulators","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","position control","radial basis function networks","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self adaptive composite control","flexible joint robot","RBF neural network","linear elastic subsystem","computed torque method","compensating controller","Lyapunov theory","flexible planner manipulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flexible joint","self-adaptive","composite control","neural network","trajectory tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-adaptive composite control for flexible joint robot based on RBF neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5658637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692109","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-adaptive composite control for flexible joint robot based on RBF neural network","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"2018311220d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044329S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5658255","articleId":"5658637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5658645,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Ning","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Ning","id":"37087959180"},{"name":"Yufeng Liu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Yufeng Liu","id":"37087199986"},{"name":"Huiying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Huiying Zhang","id":"37087397575"},{"name":"Qiang Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, System and Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Qiang Ji","id":"37087169858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658645","abstract":"Short-term load forecasting(STLF) is of great importance for the safety and stabilization of grids.

The application results show that the DADHNN method can establish the subnets automatically and have explainable ability to users, which provides a new way to the industry product-processing.","doi":"10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658671","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639100/5658307/05658671.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"347","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data attributes decomposition-based hierarchical neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Data attributes decomposition-based hierarchical neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692495","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5658671/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data attributes decomposition-based hierarchical neural network","confLoc":"Xiamen","sourcePdf":"1007610343d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047248S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","xplore-issue":"5658307","articleId":"5658671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5658727,"authors":[{"name":"Du Shiping","affiliation":["College of Biology and Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Du Shiping","id":"37593600000"},{"name":"Wang Jian","affiliation":["College of Biology and Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Wang Jian","id":"37591700100"},{"name":"Wei Yuming","affiliation":["Triticeae Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Wei Yuming","id":"37604031900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658727","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","fuzzy set theory","hidden Markov models","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second order hidden Markov model","fuzzy c-means","fuzzy entropy","pattern recognition","speech recognition","fuzzy objective function","formulae solving model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["second-order hidden Markov models","forward-backward procedure","Baum-Welch algorithm","fuzzy c-means","fuzzy entropy"]}],"abstract":"Second-order hidden Markov models (HMM2) have been widely used in pattern recognition, especially in speech recognition.

Many techniques have been developed in the past years, but our classification experiments show that some of these techniques are not robust while others suffer from the accuracy and the effectiveness for the classification of hyperspectral data. In this paper, a novel band compression algorithm is proposed based on the fusion of segmented principle component analysis (SPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimension reduction. We first select the bands independently via SPCA and LDA. Theoretical analysis shows that the selected bands have little correlation, and therefore, an iterative algorithm is adopt to adaptively co-optimizing both the parameter of merging SPCA bands and LDA bands, and the classification accuracy. Our extensive experiments on two real hyperspectral datasets (AVIRIS 1992 Indian pine image and HYDICE image of Washington DC Mall), proves that the proposed technique is not only robust but offers more classification accuracy than many conventional dimension reduction techniques over several well known classifiers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Artificial neural networks","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","geophysical image processing","image classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band compression technique","hyperspectral image classification","dimension reduction","segmented principle component analysis","linear discriminant analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral data","fusion","image region classification","remote sensing","spectral band compression","aviris"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658768","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639100/5658255/05658768.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust band compression technique for hyperspectral image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A robust band compression technique for hyperspectral image classification","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11692051","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5658768/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust band compression technique for hyperspectral image classification","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"2004410787d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050852S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5658255","articleId":"5658768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5658778,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ning Wang","id":"37594211800"},{"name":"Alei Liang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Alei Liang","id":"37408551100"},{"name":"Haibing Guan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Haibing Guan","id":"37408832600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658778","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658778","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Helium","Monitoring","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","mobile robots","motion control","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-robot self deployment method","particle swarm optimization","distributed algorithm","task allocation","motion direction","robot locomotion","signal strength"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Multi-robot","distance","self-deployment","signal-strength"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658778","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639100/5658255/05658778.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-robot self-deployment method based on Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm solution for multi-robot deployment problem. We hope that the robots can complete deployment task by simple rules and sensors, relying on the few precondition. So, there is not pre-described model of the environment which is precondition of task allocation. The robots do not communicate between each other in order to cut the communication cost. The robot can be designed easily because it has not the ability of locomotion and distinguishing robot from obstacle. We assume that the robots have the sense of out-diffusion and want to keep a certain distance with neighbors. They determine motion direction and speed by sensing whether they are close to or leave their neighbors. When they believe that they reach a certain distance with neighbors, they will stop moving in order to save energy. In our method, each robot computes the distance and the variable quantity of the distance with neighbors to gain motion direction and speed, only relying on sensing the signal-strength which neighbors broadcast. In order to have a fast convergence speed, we introduce the model of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and use the distances with neighbors instead of global position to reduce this precondition. The robot will stop moving when its activity radius is smaller than a constant during a certain period. Simulation results on Player/Stage show our algorithm can get good performance, only relying on sensing the signal-strength which neighbors broadcast in different unknown environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5658778/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11692062","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5658778/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-robot self-deployment method based on Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-robot self-deployment method based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"2003410768d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057416S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639100","isNumber":"5658255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639100","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5658255","articleId":"5658778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5658782,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Information & Control Engineering Faculty, Shenyang Jianzhu University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089082651"},{"name":"Mengxin Li","affiliation":["Information & Control Engineering Faculty, Shenyang Jianzhu University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Mengxin Li","id":"37087280757"},{"name":"Ke Xu","affiliation":["Information & Control Engineering Faculty, Shenyang Jianzhu University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Ke Xu","id":"37087279806"},{"name":"Zaili Dong","affiliation":["Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zaili","lastName":"Dong","id":"37275835300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6582-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6584-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5658782","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5658782","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","mobile robots","particle swarm optimisation","radial basis function networks","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave energy absorption system","underwater vehicle","PSORBF neural networks","underwater carrier","renewable energy","wave energy utilization","inertial pendulum","dynamics equations","simulation software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wave energy","underwater carrier","ADAMS","energy absorption efficiency","PSORBF neural network"]}],"abstract":"Technology of energy self-supply which can improve the work efficiency and extend the work time is significant for underwater carrier, such as underwater vehicle.

The multi-component nature has brought tuning problems for domain users. In this paper, we present GATuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems using genetic algorithms. We match a given schema S against generated scenarios, for which the ground truth matches are known, and find a configuration that effectively improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To search the huge space of configuration candidates efficiently, we adopt genetic algorithms during the tuning process. Experiments over four real-world domains with two main matching systems demonstrate that our approach provides more qualified matches over different domains.","doi":"10.1109/DBTA.2010.5659029","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Workshop on Database Technology and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DBTA.2010.5659029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658597","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Workshop on Database Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658186/5658597/05659029.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GATuner: Tuning Schema Matching Systems Using Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659029/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GATuner: Tuning Schema Matching Systems Using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659029/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11691816","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"27-28 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GATuner: Tuning Schema Matching Systems Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059604S","chronDate":"27-28 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658186","isNumber":"5658597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658186","xplore-issue":"5658597","articleId":"5659029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5659039,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institution, Qionghai, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Ruiqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406140700"},{"name":"Fuxiong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institution, Qionghai, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Fuxiong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38183669200"},{"name":"Wentian Ji","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institution, Qionghai, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Wentian","lastName":"Ji","id":"37065134100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6977-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6975-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-1923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-194X"}],"articleNumber":"5659039","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Electricity","Forecasting","Load modeling","Accuracy","Time series analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic forecasting","electricity supply industry","errors","load forecasting","moving average processes","particle swarm optimisation","pricing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","GM(1,2) method","electricity price forecasting","error improvement prediction","moving average method","time series","processed series","historical data","PJM market","bidding strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659039","abstract":"Under deregulated environment, accurate electricity price forecasting is a crucial issue concerned by all participants.

The earlier metric learning algorithms mostly focus on finding distance metric from sample vectors. However, when dealing with images, the existing approaches often encounter high computational cost due to huge dimensionality of image vector space and instability in performance caused by distortion effect of image vectorization. This paper proposes a new technique coined Local Image Distance Metric Learning(LIDML) for image distance measurement. LIDML learns an appropriate distance metric for a novel image distance by optimizing local compactness and local separability. In LIDML, the size of distance metric is comparatively small and the model processes a closed-form solution via eigen-decomposition, both of which make LIDML fairly efficient. The experimental results on image classification demonstrate effectiveness of our method, and also show that LIDML can handle expensive computation difficulty case that hardly be handled satisfactorily by previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659117","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654671/5659117/05659195.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Image Distance Metric Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Training","Accuracy","Machine learning","Silicon","Principal component analysis","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local image distance metric learning","machine learning","pattern recognition","image vector space","distortion effect","image vectorization","image distance measurement","local compactness","local separability","eigen-decomposition","image classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Local Image Distance Metric Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659195/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659195/","accessionNumber":"11694052","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Image Distance Metric Learning","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046258S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654671","isNumber":"5659117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654671","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5659117","articleId":"5659195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5659211,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Pan","affiliation":["School of Science, Huazhong Agricultural University, HZAU, Wuhan, China","Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Pan","id":"37069284000"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Wei","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Applied Mathematics, Hubei University of Economics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37597692200"},{"name":"Xinge You","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xinge","lastName":"You","id":"37290310400"},{"name":"Qinmu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qinmu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37591517000"},{"name":"Liangshuo Ning","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Guangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Liangshuo","lastName":"Ning","id":"37591572300"},{"name":"Zhihong Xiao","affiliation":["School of Science, Huazhong Agricultural University, HZAU, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37587386300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7210-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7209-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5659211","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"Linear discriminant analysis(LDA) is one of the most popular methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, but it may encounter the so called small sample size(SSS) problem when applied to high dimensional data analysis such as face recognition.

recognition of realistic Chinese handwriting is of overwhelming interests yet challenging. Among many factors, enough training samples and advanced learning method are critical to identify the underlying symbols of a string image. This paper presents an embedding training of MQDF classifier with the help of synthetic string samples within the segmentation-recognition integration framework. First, the fed string images are over-segmented into primitive segments. Then a separate MQDF classifier re-trained discriminatively on string samples is used to measure the confidence of segmentation hypothesis. The optimal path, including segmentation and recognition results, can be finally identified using the beam search technique. Merely using the natural string samples, there exist heavy problems of string sample shortage. To expand the training data, a perturbation model has been utilized for synthesizing string samples. Experiments are conducted on the standard subset of HIT-MW database. Both the embedding training method and the distortion model demonstrate appealing results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Hidden Markov models","Nonlinear distortion","Thyristors","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","realistic images","search problems","string matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative training","MQDF classifier","synthetic Chinese string","realistic Chinese handwriting recognition","string image symbols","segmentation-recognition integration","beam search technique","perturbation model","HIT-MW database","embedding training method","distortion model","modified quadratic discriminant function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659250","publicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654671/5659117/05659250.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative Training of MQDF Classifier on Synthetic Chinese String Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Training of MQDF Classifier on Synthetic Chinese String Samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659250/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659250/","accessionNumber":"11694107","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Training of MQDF Classifier on Synthetic Chinese String Samples","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05378S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654671","isNumber":"5659117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654671","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5659117","articleId":"5659250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659277,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Xian Ren","affiliation":["Center of Computer Vision and Department of Mathematics, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuan-Xian","lastName":"Ren","id":"37587405100"},{"name":"Dao-Qing Dai","affiliation":["Center of Computer Vision and Department of Mathematics, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dao-Qing","lastName":"Dai","id":"37361981700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7210-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7209-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5659277","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"Practical face recognition systems are sometimes confronted with low-resolution face images. Traditional super-resolution (SR) methods usually have limited performance because the target of SR may not consistent with that of classification, and time-consuming sophisticated SR algorithms are not suitable for real-time applications. We propose a piecewise regularized canonical correlation discrimination(rCCD) approach for LR face recognition without any SR preprocessing. The new method aims to maximize the canonical correlation between neighbor samples with different modes (i.e., low-resolution image and its high-resolution counterpart) while minimize the correlation between faraway modes. The experiments on publicly available databases show that our rCCD method indeed improves the recognition performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654671/5659117/05659277.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","doi":"10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piecewise Regularized Canonical Correlation Discrimination for Low-Resolution Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Correlation","Face","Databases","Image resolution","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","face recognition","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piecewise regularized canonical correlation discrimination","face recognition","low resolution face image","super resolution method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Piecewise Regularized Canonical Correlation Discrimination for Low-Resolution Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659277/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693912","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piecewise Regularized Canonical Correlation Discrimination for Low-Resolution Face Recognition","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092662S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654671","isNumber":"5659117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654671","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5659117","articleId":"5659277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5659292,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobo Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596819500"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280205100"},{"name":"Jun Liang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37600418300"},{"name":"Qiaolin Ye","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qiaolin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37591620800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7210-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7209-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5659292","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Training","Support vector machines","Benchmark testing","Kernel","Linear programming","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","regularization technique","benchmark data set","support vector machine","robust and sparse twin support vector regression"]}],"abstract":"Twin support vector regression (TSVR) was proposed recently as a novel regressor that tries to find a pair of nonparallel planes, i.e. \u03b5-insensitive up- and down-bound, by solving two related SVM-type problems. Though TSVR exhibits good performance compared with conventional methods like SVR, it suffers from several issues. In this paper, we propose a novel regression algorithm called Robust and Sparse Twin Support Vector Regression (RSTSVR). The idea is to reformulate TSVR as a strongly convex problem by regularization technique firstly and then derive a linear programming (LP) formulation which is not only simple but also introduces robustness and sparseness. Instead of solving the resulting LP problem straightforward, we convert the primal LP to its dual to simplify computation. The experimental results on several publicly available benchmark data sets show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659292","publicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654671/5659117/05659292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Sparse Twin Support Vector Regression via Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659292/","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Sparse Twin Support Vector Regression via Linear Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693927","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659292/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Sparse Twin Support Vector Regression via Linear Programming","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059946S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654671","isNumber":"5659117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654671","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5659117","articleId":"5659292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659313,"authors":[{"name":"Baochuan Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Baochuan","lastName":"Pang","id":"37605907000"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["Wenhua College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089082661"},{"name":"Qianqing Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qianqing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37594532300"},{"name":"Zhifan Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhifan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086102576"},{"name":"Qinmu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qinmu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37591517000"},{"name":"Xinge You","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xinge","lastName":"You","id":"37290310400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7210-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7209-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5659313","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":511},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659313","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Labeling","Computer architecture","Machine learning","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","object recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell nucleus segmentation","color histopathological imagery","convolutional networks","high level vision problem","objection recognition","typical low level image processing task","image segmentation","gradient descent techniques","histopathology images","breast cancer biopsy images","feature maps per hidden layer","pixel classification methods","FLDA","SVM","machine learning approach","high level domain specific knowledge"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659313","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654671/5659117/05659313.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition (CCPR)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell Nucleus Segmentation in Color Histopathological Imagery Using Convolutional Networks","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that convolutional networks can achieve a great deal of success in high-level vision problems such as objection recognition. In this paper, convolutional networks are used to solve a typical low-level image processing task, image segmentation. Here, the convolutional networks are trained using gradient descent techniques to solve the problem of segmenting the cell nuclei from the background in the histopathology images. Using a dataset with 58 H&E stained breast cancer biopsy images, we find that the convolutional networks, with 3 hidden layers and 8 feature maps per hidden layer, provide superior performance to other pixel classification methods including FLDA and SVM. We also show two important properties of the convolutional networks as a segmentation method. First, as a machine learning approach, the convolution networks encode enough high-level domain-specific knowledge into the final segmentation strategy by learning the training data. Second, the convolutional networks can use appropriate amount of context information in segmenting by optimizing the weights of the filters in the networks through the learning process. In the end of this paper, several possible directions for future research are also proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659313/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11693948","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659313/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cell Nucleus Segmentation in Color Histopathological Imagery Using Convolutional Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Nucleus Segmentation in Color Histopathological Imagery Using Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046656S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654671","isNumber":"5659117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654671","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5659117","articleId":"5659313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5659456,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehong Gao","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Centre of Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Yuehong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37404898900"},{"name":"Yuming Jiang","affiliation":["Centre of Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279388000"},{"name":"Tao Lin","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403829800"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5659456","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Cognitive radio","Calculus","Delay","Numerical models","Simulation","Queueing analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Performance Bound","Stochastic Network Calculus"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we use stochastic network calculus to analyze the performance bounds for a cognitive radio network with two classes of input traffic.

Finally, numerical results as well as simulation results are compared and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659456","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05659456.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659456","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance bounds for a cognitive radio network with network calculus analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance bounds for a cognitive radio network with network calculus analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659456/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance bounds for a cognitive radio network with network calculus analysis","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0003253d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137944S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5659456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659457,"authors":[{"name":"Shoufeng Wang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shoufeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599720300"},{"name":"Fan Li","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"37593251300"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068256200"},{"name":"Ben Wang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Wang","id":"38245909500"},{"name":"Yinghai Zhang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279972800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5659457","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Throughput","Probability","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Equations","Switches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","channel reservation","Markov chain","user dominated"]}],"abstract":"Channel reservation is used to decrease the drop ratio of secondary users caused by spectrum handover.

Most of the existing works considered the cognitive scenario under perfect knowledge of system state, such as channel state information (CSI) and sensing information (SI). However, it is serious to properly regulate the interference caused by secondary users (SUs) to each primary user (PU). In this paper, we focus on the design and analysis of subcarrier and power allocation scheme under imperfect CSI for cognitive OFDM systems. A smart way using training preamble is presented to obtain the CSI of Rayleigh block-fading channel between the transmitter and receiver. During the training phase, the receiver estimates the channel and feeds the estimate back to the transmitter. During the transmission phase, a two-step algorithm for capacity maximization is proposed to obtain the subcarrier assignment and power allocation for each SU. It is shown by extensive simulation and analysis that, by increasing the number of training symbols, the total capacity can be largely enhanced.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659458","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05659458.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation in cognitive OFDM systems under imperfect CSI with smart channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659458/","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation in cognitive OFDM systems under imperfect CSI with smart channel estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659458/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier and power allocation in cognitive OFDM systems under imperfect CSI with smart channel estimation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0002125d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087559S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5659458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659459,"authors":[{"name":"Biling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Network Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Biling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598202600"},{"name":"Kai Chen","affiliation":["School of Photoelectric Information & Communication Engineering, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596849000"},{"name":"Xuerong Gou","affiliation":["School of Network Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuerong","lastName":"Gou","id":"37393116400"},{"name":"Shiduan Cheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiduan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37594924900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6853-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6851-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6852-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5659459","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Relays","Cognitive radio","Simulation","Numerical models","Distributed algorithms","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum leasing","cooperative networks","game theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659459","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd IEEE InternationalConference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640582/5657774/05659459.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2010.5659459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5657774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum leasing via selective cooperation in distributed cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) has been widely recognized as a promising paradigm to achieve efficient use of the spectrum resource. While a lot of attention has been paid to the hierarchical access model of CR, the spectrum leasing model in which PUs can actively lease their spectrum to SUs for certain reward has not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, by assuming a PU is willing to lease its bandwidth for a fraction of time to SUs in exchange for selective cooperation, we propose a game model to describe the dynamic interaction between the PU and SUs. In our model, the PU plays a game with each of the potential SUs and selects the best one to cooperate with. We prove that there is always a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) for each game. Moreover, we propose a simple distributed algorithm for practical implementation of the model. Simulation results verify that our approach can benefit both the PU and the SU in terms of utility and transmission rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659459/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659459/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum leasing via selective cooperation in distributed cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum leasing via selective cooperation in distributed cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0004079d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073195S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640582","isNumber":"5657774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640582","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5657774","articleId":"5659459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659462,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan B.

Although the required constitutive parameters of a transformation optical structure can be challenging-inherently anisotropic and spatially varying, with both magnetic and electric response-nevertheless the parameter requirements can often be met or approximated through the use of artificially structured metamaterials.

The method proposed is then applied to stabilization via state-feedback both for the nominal and the uncertain cases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2097351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5710453/05659466.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"386","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2097351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Stability and Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems With Dwell Time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Stability and Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems With Dwell Time","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5659466/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11794067","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Stability and Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems With Dwell Time","sourcePdf":"tac-shaked-2097351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091063S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5710453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"5710453","articleId":"5659466","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":5659467,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Heldring","affiliation":["Dept. of Signal Processing and Telecommunications, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5705613/5659467/5659467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Heldring was born in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on December 12, 1966.

The main principle is to select homogeneous pixels in a large-scale area in the filtering process, which is called pretesting. To preserve details and fine structures while despeckling, the homogeneous pixels are selected by comparing their 3 \u00d7 3 neighboring windows. A test statistic based on the complex Wishart distribution is used to decide the selection of homogeneous pixels. Speckle filtering is processed by summing up the homogeneous pixels with weights according to the values of their test statistics. To accelerate the pretest filter, we further propose a refined algorithm, which eliminates redundant operations without deteriorating the performance.

The main property of the proposed technique consists in its robustness to biased (poor) initial training sets. The presented method considers the 1-D output space of the classifier to identify the most uncertain samples whose labeling and inclusion in the training set involve a high probability to improve the classification results. A simple histogram-thresholding algorithm is used to find out the low-density (i.e., under the cluster assumption, the most uncertain) region in the 1-D SVM output space. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared it with other active-learning techniques proposed in the remote sensing literature using multispectral and hyperspectral data. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed technique provided the best tradeoff among robustness to biased (poor) initial training samples, computational complexity, classification accuracy, and the number of new labeled samples necessary to reach convergence.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2083673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5753065/05659475.pdf","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2083673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Cluster-Assumption Based Active-Learning Technique for Classification of Remote Sensing Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659475/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Cluster-Assumption Based Active-Learning Technique for Classification of Remote Sensing Images","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960943","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659475/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Cluster-Assumption Based Active-Learning Technique for Classification of Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2083673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068542S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5753065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5753065","articleId":"5659475","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5659481,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Dlala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Science and Technology, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Dlala","id":"37547854400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5659481","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1053},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic hysteresis","Iron","Computational modeling","Interpolation","Numerical models","Mathematical model","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","interpolation","inverse problems","magnetic hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Preisach hysteresis model","nonlinear finite element method","inverse problem","Everett function","electrical steel","cubic spline interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence","Everett function","finite-element analysis (FEA)","fixed-point method","inverse problems","magnetic hysteresis","Preisach model","software simulation tools"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with key problems that have been commonly encountered in the implementation of the Preisach model into finite-element (FE) programs. Such problems include the inverse problem imposed by certain FE formulations, the abundance use of experimental data needed for identification, and the complex hysteretic nonlinearity inherited in electromagnetic problems. The aim is to alleviate these problems using new efficient algorithms to facilitate the inclusion of the Preisach model in FE equations. The inversion of the model is evaded by systematically creating an inverted Everett function identified from a few parameters usually provided by the makers of electrical steel. The Everett function and its derivatives are ensured to be smooth and continuous by using cubic spline interpolation, which is important for producing stable iterative solutions in the FE computations. Thorough investigations and FE simulations supported by experiments show that the proposed algorithms are capable of successfully accomplishing good accuracy, fast computation, and numerical convergence.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2097274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5697331/05659481.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2097274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inclusion of the Preisach Hysteresis Model in Nonlinear Finite-Element Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659481/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inclusion of the Preisach Hysteresis Model in Nonlinear Finite-Element Methods","volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769594","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659481/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inclusion of the Preisach Hysteresis Model in Nonlinear Finite-Element Methods","sourcePdf":"tmag-dlala-2097274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094419S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5697331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5697331","articleId":"5659481","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5659483,"authors":[{"name":"Kangjoo Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"firstName":"Kangjoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37601243700"},{"name":"Sungho Tak","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Tak","id":"37589258300"},{"name":"Jong Chul Ye","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"firstName":"Jong Chul","lastName":"Ye","id":"37286744300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"5659483","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1937},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Brain modeling","Sparse matrices","Neurons","Maximum likelihood estimation","Adaptation model","Atomic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical MRI","data analysis","haemodynamics","independent component analysis","medical image processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven sparse general linear model","fMRI analysis","sparse dictionary learning","statistical analysis","functional magnetic resonance imaging","independent component analysis","ICA","V1 cells","electrophysiology","human medial temporal lobe","compressed sensing","spatially adaptive design matrix","integrated neural hemodynamics","minimum description length","neural response","signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","data-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis","K-SVD","minimum description length (MDL) principle","sparse dictionary learning","sparse generalized linear model","statistical parametric mapping"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Brain","Evoked Potentials, Auditory","Evoked Potentials, Motor","Humans","Linear Models","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Models, Statistical","Principal Component Analysis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel statistical analysis method for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to overcome the drawbacks of conventional data-driven methods such as the independent component analysis (ICA). Although ICA has been broadly applied to fMRI due to its capacity to separate spatially or temporally independent components, the assumption of independence has been challenged by recent studies showing that ICA does not guarantee independence of simultaneously occurring distinct activity patterns in the brain. Instead, sparsity of the signal has been shown to be more promising. This coincides with biological findings such as sparse coding in V1 simple cells, electrophysiological experiment results in the human medial temporal lobe, etc. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, a new data driven fMRI analysis that is derived solely based upon the sparsity of the signals. A compressed sensing based data-driven sparse generalized linear model is proposed that enables estimation of spatially adaptive design matrix as well as sparse signal components that represent synchronous, functionally organized and integrated neural hemodynamics. Furthermore, a minimum description length (MDL)-based model order selection rule is shown to be essential in selecting unknown sparsity level for sparse dictionary learning. Using simulation and real fMRI experiments, we show that the proposed method can adapt individual variation better compared to the conventional ICA methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2097275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5760040/05659483.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2097275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5760040","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Sparse GLM for fMRI Analysis Using Sparse Dictionary Learning With MDL Criterion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Sparse GLM for fMRI Analysis Using Sparse Dictionary Learning With MDL Criterion","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972237","pubMedId":"21138799","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5659483/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Sparse GLM for fMRI Analysis Using Sparse Dictionary Learning With MDL Criterion","sourcePdf":"tmi-ye-2097275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101374S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5760040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5760040","articleId":"5659483","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5659484,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez","affiliation":["University of C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5710128/5659484/5659484-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedro Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez (M'08) was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, in 1982.

The process for obtaining the coefficients is carried out in three steps. First, an evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is applied, in order to produce an RBF neural network (RBFNN) with a reduced number of RBF transformations and the simplest structure possible. Then, the initial attribute space (or, as commonly known as in logistic regression literature, the covariate space) is transformed by adding the nonlinear transformations of the input variables given by the RBFs of the best individual in the final generation. Finally, a maximum likelihood optimization method determines the coefficients associated with a multilogistic regression model built in this augmented covariate space. In this final step, two different multilogistic regression algorithms are applied: one considers all initial and RBF covariates (multilogistic initial-RBF regression) and the other one incrementally constructs the model and applies cross validation, resulting in an automatic covariate selection [simplelogistic initial-RBF regression (SLIRBF)]. Both methods include a regularization parameter, which has been also optimized. The methodology proposed is tested using 18 benchmark classification problems from well-known machine learning problems and two real agronomical problems. The results are compared with the corresponding multilogistic regression methods applied to the initial covariate space, to the RBFNNs obtained by the EP algorithm, and to other probabilistic classifiers, including different RBFNN design methods [e.g., relaxed variable kernel density estimation, support vector machines, a sparse classifier (sparse multinomial logistic regression)] and a procedure similar to SLIRBF but using product unit basis functions. The SLIRBF models are found to be competitive when compared with the corresponding multilogistic regression methods and the RBFEP method. A measure of statistical significance is used, which indicates that SLIRBF reaches the state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2093537","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5710128/05659484.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2093537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logistic Regression by Means of Evolutionary Radial Basis Function Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Logistic Regression by Means of Evolutionary Radial Basis Function Neural Networks","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11794000","pubMedId":"21138802","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5659484/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logistic Regression by Means of Evolutionary Radial Basis Function Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-gutierrez-2093537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130036S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5710128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5710128","articleId":"5659484","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5659485,"authors":[{"name":"Thuan Q.

While considerable progress has been made, the results at present are still relatively limited, in part due to the large numbers of symbolic rules that can be generated. Most past work to address this issue has focused on progressively more powerful methods for rule extraction (RE) that try to minimize the number of weights and/or improve rule expressiveness. In contrast, here we take a different approach in which we modify the error backpropagation training process so that it learns a different hidden layer representation of input patterns than would normally occur. Using five publicly available datasets, we show via computational experiments that the modified learning method helps to extract fewer rules without increasing individual rule complexity and without decreasing classification accuracy. We conclude that modifying error backpropagation so that it more effectively separates learned pattern encodings in the hidden layer is an effective way to improve contemporary RE methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2094205","startPage":"264","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2094205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710128","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5710128/05659485.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guiding Hidden Layer Representations for Improved Rule Extraction From Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659485/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Guiding Hidden Layer Representations for Improved Rule Extraction From Neural Networks","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5659485/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11794001","pubMedId":"21138801","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guiding Hidden Layer Representations for Improved Rule Extraction From Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-huynh-2094205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086344S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5710128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5710128","articleId":"5659485","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5659492,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5730612/5659492/5659492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leila Musavian (S'05\u2013M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1999 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from King's College London, London, U.K., in 2006.","She was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National Institute of Scientific Research-Energy, Materials, and Telecommunications, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada.

An underlay cognitive radio system, with one primary user and a secondary user, with constraints on interference leakage imposed by the primary receiver is considered. The transmission parameters of the secondary user are set optimally such that the successful communications for the primary user in terms of a minimum rate to be supported is satisfied, irrespective of co-existence with the secondary user. We obtain interference constraints that, when satisfied by the secondary users, is sufficient to satisfy the service outage requirement of the primary user. We further study the performance of the secondary user's link employing an adaptive MQAM scheme when, on top of the aforementioned interference constraint, the secondary user is also required to satisfy a statistical delay QoS constraint. Considering two modulation schemes, i.e., continuous MQAM and discrete MQAM with restricted constellations, we obtain the effective capacity of the secondary user's link and derive the optimum power allocation that maximizes the effective capacity of the secondary user.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2097282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730612","startPage":"901","endPage":"911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5730612/05659492.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Modulation in Spectrum-Sharing Channels Under Delay Quality-of-Service Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5659492/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Modulation in Spectrum-Sharing Channels Under Delay Quality-of-Service Constraints","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11862645","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Modulation in Spectrum-Sharing Channels Under Delay Quality-of-Service Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-musavian-2097282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095769S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5730612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5730612","articleId":"5659492","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5659494,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Lyang Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Lyang","lastName":"Jang","id":"37290716100"},{"name":"Chia-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"37402706300"},{"name":"Jyun-Yan Wun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyun-Yan","lastName":"Wun","id":"37602519200"},{"name":"Miin-Horng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Miin-Horng","lastName":"Juang","id":"37408180600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5659494","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Impedance","Inductors","Frequency conversion","MOSFETs","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","dual resonance model","frequency dividers","power dividers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature injection-locked frequency dividers","dual-resonance resonator","divide-by-2 quadrature injection-locked frequency divider","transformer-coupled quadrature voltage controlled oscillator","NMOS injectors","CMOS technology","high-frequency band tuning range","free-running QILFD","low-frequency band tuning range","low-frequency band injection signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","divide-by-2","dual-resonance","transformer-coupled quadrature injection-locked frequency divider (QILFD)"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies the property of a divide-by-2 quadrature injection-locked frequency divider (QILFD) with dual-resonance resonator.

The proposed model explicitly incorporates an n - K security criterion by which power balance is guaranteed under any contingency state comprising the simultaneous loss of up to K generation units. Instead of considering all possible contingency states, which would render the problem intractable, a novel method based on robust optimization is proposed. Using the notion of umbrella contingency, the robust counterpart of the original problem is formulated. The resulting model is a particular instance of bilevel programming which is solved by its transformation to an equivalent single-level mixed-integer programming problem. Unlike previously reported contingency-dependent approaches, the robust model does not depend on the size of the set of credible contingencies, thus providing a computationally efficient framework. Simulation results back up these conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2087367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05659501.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2087367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contingency-Constrained Unit Commitment With - Security Criterion: A Robust Optimization Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659501/","displayDocTitle":"Contingency-Constrained Unit Commitment With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n - K$</tex></formula> Security Criterion: A Robust Optimization Approach","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175102","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659501/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contingency-Constrained Unit Commitment With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n - K$</tex></formula> Security Criterion: A Robust Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-street-2087367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12865S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5659501","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5659502,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6099858/5659502/5659502-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongbin Sun received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","Currently, he holds a post-doctoral posotion with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.

However, the write-to-MRAM process is relatively slow and results in high dynamic power consumption. Such inherent disadvantages of MRAM make researchers easily conclude that MRAM can only be used for low-level caches (e.g., L2 or L3 cache), where cache memories are less frequently accessed and slow write to MRAM can be more easily compensated using simple architectural techniques. By developing a hybrid cache architecture, this paper attempts to show that, with appropriate architecture design, MRAM can also be used in L1 cache to improve both the energy efficiency and soft error immunity. The basic idea is to supplement the MRAM L1 cache with several small SRAM buffers, which can substantially mitigate the performance degradation and dynamic energy overhead induced by MRAM write operations. Moreover, the proposed hybrid cache architecture is also an efficient solution to protect cache memory from radiation-induced soft errors, as MRAM is inherently invulnerable to emissive particles. Simulation results show that, with only less than 2% performance degradation, the proposed design approach can reduce the power consumption by up to 76.1% on average compared with the traditional SRAM L1 cache. In addition, the architectural vulnerability factor of L1 data cache is reduced from 28.3% to as low as 0.5%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2090914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2090914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6099858/05659502.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Magnetic RAM to Build Low-Power and Soft Error-Resilient L1 Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using Magnetic RAM to Build Low-Power and Soft Error-Resilient L1 Cache","volume":"20","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659502/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12409678","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659502/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Magnetic RAM to Build Low-Power and Soft Error-Resilient L1 Cache","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sun-2090914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108327S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6099858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6099858","articleId":"5659502","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5659691,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These techniques are divided here into three categories. The first category uses signals from existing process sensors, such as resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), thermocouples, or pressure transmitters, to help verify the performance of the sensors and process-to-sensor interfaces and also to identify problems in the process. The second category depends on signals from test sensors (e.g., accelerometers) that are installed on plant equipment (e.g., rotating machinery) in order to measure such parameters as vibration amplitude. The vibration amplitude is then trended to identify the onset of degradation or failure. This second category also includes the use of wireless sensors to provide additional points for collection of data or allow plants to measure multiple parameters to cover not only vibration amplitude but also ambient temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. With each additional parameter that can be measured and correlated with equipment condition, the diagnostic capabilities of the category can increase exponentially. The first and second categories just mentioned are passive, which means that they do not involve any perturbation of the equipment or the process being monitored. In contrast, the third category is active. That is, the third category involves injecting a test signal into the equipment (sensors, cables, etc.) to measure its response and thereby diagnose its performance. For example, the response time of temperature sensors (RTDs and thermocouples) can be measured by the application of the step current signal to the sensor and analysis of the sensor response to the application of the step current. Cable anomalies can be located by a similar procedure referred to as the time domain reflectometry (TDR). This test involves a signal that is sent through the cable to the end device. Its reflection is then recorded and compared to a baseline to identify impedance changes along the cable and thereby identify and locate anomalies. Combined with measurement of cable inductance (L), capacitance (C), and loop resistance (R), or LCR testing, the TDR method can identify and locate anomalies along a cable, identify moisture in a cable or end device, and even reveal gross problems in the cable insulation material. There are also frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) methods, reverse TDR, trending of insulation resistance (IR) measurement, and other techniques which can be used in addition to or instead of TDR and LCR to provide a wide spectrum of tools for cable condition monitoring. The three categories of techniques described in this paper are the subject of current research and development projects conducted by the author and his colleagues at the AMS Corporation with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","volume":"60","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684841","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5659691/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"State-of-the-Art Predictive Maintenance Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-of-the-Art Predictive Maintenance Techniques","sourcePdf":"tim-hashemian-2047662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045439S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5659689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5659689","articleId":"5659691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5659862,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37597576400"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5659862","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1851},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Receiving antennas","Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Base stations","Transmitting antennas","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcasting","interference suppression","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","precoding","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient channel block diagonalization method","generalized zero forcing","MIMO broadcasting systems","GZF precoder","zero forcing beamforming method","downlink multiuser MIMO communications","receive antenna","singular value decomposition","SVD-BD method","multiuser interference elimination","channel pseudo inverse matrix","block diagonal matrix","weighted sum rate maximization","weighted sum power minimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO broadcasting","generalized zero forcing","channel block diagonalization","precoding"]}],"abstract":"Generalized Zero Forcing (GZF) is an extension of the zero forcing beamforming method to deal with downlink multiuser MIMO communications when users have more than one receive antenna. In literature, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based channel Block Diagonalization (BD) is proposed to eliminate multiuser interference for GZF, but it is computationally inefficient. In this letter, we propose to generate a GZF precoder by using the product of a channel pseudo inverse matrix and a block diagonal matrix with an appropriate form, whose optimality for solving weighted sum rate maximization and weighted sum power minimization problems is proven. Later by using the proposed precoder a novel BD method with significantly lower complexity is presented. The complexity analysis shows that our proposal is computationally more efficient than SVD-BD.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.100567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5732655/05659862.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.100567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732655","startPage":"739","endPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Channel Block Diagonalization Method for Generalized Zero Forcing Assisted MIMO Broadcasting Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Channel Block Diagonalization Method for Generalized Zero Forcing Assisted MIMO Broadcasting Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874699","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5659862/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Channel Block Diagonalization Method for Generalized Zero Forcing Assisted MIMO Broadcasting Systems","sourcePdf":"0739-tw1103-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059805S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5732655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5732655","articleId":"5659862","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5659863,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["Michigan Technological University, USA","Arizona State University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5659863/5659863-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Wang received the B.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from Michigan Technological University, Houghton, in 2007, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

A major performance-degrading factor in energy detection is the noise floor, which is aggravated for low-duty-cycle UWB signals with a large time-bandwidth product. In this paper, weighted energy detection (WED) techniques are developed for effective noise suppression. The received signal is processed by a set of parallel integrators, each corresponding to a different integration time-window within a symbol period. The outputs of these integrators are weighted and linearly combined to generate decision statistics, while the weights are determined by the signal power collected from the corresponding integrators to improve the effective signal to noise ratio. The WED principle is applied to all phases of receiver processing, including signal detection, timing synchronization and data demodulation. For each phase, the optimal linear detector parameters, including decision thresholds and weighting coefficients, are derived analytically. Simulations show that the proposed noncoherent WED receiver enhances the bit-error-rate performance compared to conventional energy detectors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Energy Detection for Noncoherent Ultra-Wideband Receiver Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.101390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05659863.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.101390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Energy Detection for Noncoherent Ultra-Wideband Receiver Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5659863/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805082","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Energy Detection for Noncoherent Ultra-Wideband Receiver Design","sourcePdf":"710-tw1102-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104995S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5659863","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659865,"authors":[{"name":"Sanaz Barghi","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Sanaz","lastName":"Barghi","id":"37542471000"},{"name":"Hamid Jafarkhani","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Jafarkhani","id":"37274579200"},{"name":"Homayoun Yousefi'zadeh","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Homayoun","lastName":"Yousefi'zadeh","id":"37269361600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5659865","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Algorithm design and analysis","Detectors","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","radio links","radio reception","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-assisted MPR-MAC","lossy channel","MAC algorithm","wireless network","MIMO communication","colliding packet","MAC design","PHY design","multipacket reception","WLAN","lossy link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPR","MIMO","PHY","MAC","Cross-Layer Design","IEEE 802.11"]}],"abstract":"Coping with collisions is one of the biggest challenges in the design of MAC algorithms for wireless networks.

A relay selection criterion, suitable for cognitive relay networks, is provided, and using it, we derive the outage probability. It is shown that the outage probability of cognitive relay networks is higher than that of conventional relay networks due to the interference constraint, and we quantify the increase. In addition, the outage probability is affected by the distance ratio of the interference link (between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver) to the relaying link (between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver). We also prove that cognitive relay networks achieve the same full selection diversity order as conventional relay networks, and that the decrease in outage probability achieved by increasing the selection diversity (the number of relays) is not less than that in conventional relay networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","volume":"10","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11805085","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5659866/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability of Cognitive Relay Networks with Interference Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability of Cognitive Relay Networks with Interference Constraints","sourcePdf":"390-tw1102-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079583S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"410","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5659866","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5659868,"authors":[{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5659868/5659868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gongpu Wang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui China, in 2001, the M.Sc. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing China, in 2004.

In our model, Primary User (PU) is the game leader and jointly determines its power allocation (to guarantee its QoS requirement) and the interference price charged to Secondary User (SU) (to reap revenue). Meanwhile, SU is the game follower and determines its power demand in response to PU's decisions. We quantify PU's and SU's benefit from the channel sharing model by deriving the Stackelberg equilibrium. Our results show that PU's equilibrium profit is asymptotically upper bounded with its marginal power cost and rate requirement. A distributed algorithm is proposed to find the equilibrium. We also propose an incentive-compatible mechanism for PU and SU to keep the social welfare optimum cooperatively. We extend our Stackelberg game to the multiple SUs scenario, where the interference among SUs results in a noncooperative power demand subgame. We propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm for PU to maximize its profit. Our results show that PU can benefit by selecting multiple SUs to share its channel if SUs' mutual interference is limited.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.091430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05659869.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.120310.091430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Pricing and Power Allocation for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks with Stackelberg Game Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659869/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Pricing and Power Allocation for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks with Stackelberg Game Model","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742909","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5659869/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Pricing and Power Allocation for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks with Stackelberg Game Model","sourcePdf":"012-tw1101-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074307S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5659869","onlineDate":"06 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5659870,"authors":[{"name":"Meriam Rezk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5659870/5659870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meriam Rezk (S'99 - M'10) received her B.S. in 1999 and her M.S. in 2003 from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.

Two sources of error are considered: errors due to noise and errors due to time variations induced by Doppler effects. The MMLD relies on the available channel estimate whereas the GLRD combines the channel estimate with a block of received data and uses a joint channel-symbol estimation approach to solve for the transmitted symbols. The GLRD is shown to outperform the MMLD whenever errors in channel estimation are incurred and the performance gap depends on the amount of error. Furthermore, the GLRD provides a unified receiver structure which can also be applied to differentially encoded MIMO systems and to situation where no channel estimate is available as in blind MIMO. The improved performance of the GLRD comes with increased computational complexity. This problem is addressed through search efficient algorithms based on the branch-estimate-bound optimization framework. We analyze the performance of the GLRD and provide a tight upper bound on the BER of the system at high SNR.

Such a venture of cognitive robotics has developed robots with redundant number of sensors and actuators in order to perceive the world and act up on it in a human-like fashion. A major challenge to deal with these robots is managing the enormous amount of information continuously arriving through multiple sensors. The primates master this information management skill through their custom-built attention mechanism. Mimicking the attention behavior of the primates, therefore, has gained tremendous popularity in robotic research in the recent years ( Bar-Cohen , Biologically Inspired Intelligent Robots, 2003, and B. Webb , Biorobotics, 2003). The difficulties of redundant information management, however, is the most severe in case of visual perception of the robots. Even a moderate size image of the natural scene generally contains enough visual information to easily overload the on-line decision making process of an autonomous robot. Modeling primates-like visual attention mechanism for the robot, therefore, is becoming more popular among the robotic researchers. A visual attention model enables the robot to selectively (and autonomously) choose a \u201cbehaviorally relevant\u201d segment of visual information for further processing while relative exclusion of the others. This paper sheds light on the ongoing journey of robotics research to achieve a visual attention model which will serve as a component of cognition of the modern-day robots.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659891/","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5659891/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11883017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Visual Attention for Robotic Cognition: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Attention for Robotic Cognition: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tamd-begum-2096505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227506S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5729985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5729985","articleId":"5659891","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5659892,"authors":[{"name":"Dean G.

digitalized modified logistic map-based pseudorandom number generator (DMLM-PRNG) is proposed for randomness enhancement. Two techniques, i.e., constant parameter selection and output sequence scrambling, are employed to reduce the computation cost without sacrificing the complexity of the output sequence. Statistical test results show that with only one multiplication, DMLM-PRNG passes all cases in SP800-22. Moreover, it passes most of the cases in Crush, one of the test suites of TesuU01. When compared with solutions based on digitized pseudochaotic maps previously proposed in the literature, in terms of randomness quality, our system is as good as a R\u00e9nyi-map-based PRNG and better than a logistic-map-based PRNG. Moreover, compared with solutions based on a R\u00e9nyi-map-based PRNG, DMLM-PRNG is better scalable to high digital resolutions with reasonable area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","volume":"57","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693124","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5659895/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Randomness Enhancement Using Digitalized Modified Logistic Map","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomness Enhancement Using Digitalized Modified Logistic Map","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chen-2083170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066197S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5667084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5667084","articleId":"5659895","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5659901,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Tang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Materials and Application Technology of the Ministry of Education, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China","School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5697316/5659901/5659901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minghua Tang received the B.S. degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree in materials physics and chemistry from Xiangtan University, Hunan, China, in 1988 and 2007, respectively.","He is with the Faculty of Materials, Optoelectronics, and Physics, Xiangtan University, and is currently a Visiting Professor with the Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, focusing on the fabrication and the characteristics of ferroelectric thin-film memory.

Furthermore, most of these techniques use the same model, or just a few models, to characterize the volume scattering component in the decomposition for all pixels in an image. In this paper, we extend the model-based decomposition idea by creating an adaptive model-based decomposition technique, allowing us to estimate both the mean orientation angle and a degree of randomness for the canopy scattering for each pixel in an image. No scattering reflection symmetry assumption is required to determine the volume contribution. We examined the usefulness of the proposed decomposition technique by decomposing the covariance matrix using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar data at the C-, L-, and P-bands. The randomness and mean orientation angle maps generated using our adaptive decomposition significantly improve the physical interpretation of the scattering observed at the three different frequencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Model-Based Decomposition of Polarimetric SAR Covariance Matrices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076285","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5719225/05659970.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5659970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5659970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Model-Based Decomposition of Polarimetric SAR Covariance Matrices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5659970/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11833870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Model-Based Decomposition of Polarimetric SAR Covariance Matrices","sourcePdf":"tgrs-vanzyl-2076285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5719225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"5719225","articleId":"5659970","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"}]
