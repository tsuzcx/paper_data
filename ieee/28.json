The problem of external skews is solved by a clocking scheme where clock and data signals travel the same distance between the sender and receiver so that there is little skew on the 600-mV/sub pp/ external signals. There are two clocks: one for incoming data (RxClk) and one for outgoing data (TxClk). A PLL (phase-locked loop) generates the properly skewed internal clocks to operate the bus. The PLL consists of one main loop and two fine loops (one each for the receive and transmit clocks). The main loop is a VCO (voltage-controlled oscillator) based second-order loop using a 6-stage, small-swing, differential ring oscillator VCO. It is locked to the incoming RxClk after it is amplified to full CMOS levels. VCO and input clock frequency are halved to allow the phase/frequency detector more time to settle. The fine loop delays the internal clock (relative to the input RxClk) by an amount that causes the sampler to produce high and low outputs with precisely equal frequency, thereby compensating for sampler setup time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Clocks","Timing","Jitter","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital integrated circuits","phase-locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLL design","timing skews","phase-locked loop","skewed internal clocks","VCO","voltage-controlled oscillator","second-order loop","differential ring oscillator","CMOS levels","phase/frequency detector","500 MB/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=280015","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280015","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/1057/6932/00280015.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280015","startPage":"160","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PLL design for a 500 MB/s interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PLL design for a 500 MB/s interface","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4641559","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLL design for a 500 MB/s interface","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00280015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039935S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","isNumber":"6932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1057","citationCount":"32","articleId":"280015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":280021,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. McDonald","affiliation":["National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"McDonald","id":"38185244200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0987-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"280021","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":24,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Filters","Radio frequency","Resistors","Impedance","Chromium","Feedback","Frequency measurement","Packaging","Microwave measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","mixers (circuits)","MMIC","ultra-high-frequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","MMIC","image-reject front-end","image-reject mixer","LNA","low-noise amplifier","power-down stages","mixer-phase shifts","BiCMOS process","DECT frequencies","2.5 GHz","15 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A 2.5-GHz bipolar image-reject front-end that consists of an image-reject mixer, LNA (low-noise amplifier), bias, and power-down stages is described.

In the SCPA, the total active current is 15.9 mA, while in the conventional architecture it is 26.1 mA. In the SCPA, the memory cell size is equal to that in the conventional architecture; however, the number of local decoders is reduced from 64 to 8. Moreover, the number of GND lines is reduced because of a much smaller column current in SCPA.

According to CCITT recommendation O.151, pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) are required for testing. Commercially available hybrid PRBS test equipment covers data rates up to about 15 Gb/s. The test of circuits for data rates above 15 Gb/s relies on custom-tailored equipment. A monolithic solution to the test problem that offers PRBS generation, bit-error detection, scrambling, and descrambling for two channels to 12.5 Gb/s with on-chip trigger derivation is presented. A 1-channel PRBS up to 25 Gb/s is directly derived from two outputs by external multiplexing. Sequence length is switchable between 2/sup 11/-1 and 2/sup 15/-1 (CCITT rec.).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/1057/6932/00280033.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"153","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=280033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12.5 Gb/s Si bipolar IC for PRBS generation and bit error detection up to 25 Gb/s","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bipolar integrated circuits","Clocks","Testing","Flip-flops","Latches","Driver circuits","Photonic integrated circuits","High speed integrated circuits","Bit rate","Feedback loop"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","bipolar integrated circuits","digital communication systems","digital integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","error detection","optical links","signal generators","silicon","test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudo-random binary sequences","bipolar IC","PRBS generation","bit error detection","high-speed","optical fiber communication systems","CCITT recommendation O.151","pseudorandom binary sequences","testing","scrambling","descrambling","on-chip trigger derivation","external multiplexing","12.5 Gbit/s","25 Gbit/s","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","displayDocTitle":"A 12.5 Gb/s Si bipolar IC for PRBS generation and bit error detection up to 25 Gb/s","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4641555","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12.5 Gb/s Si bipolar IC for PRBS generation and bit error detection up to 25 Gb/s","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00280033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063068S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","isNumber":"6932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1057","citationCount":"8","articleId":"280033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":280034,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It can solve ill-matched resolutions. This 380-k-pixel PS-CCD provides a vertical resolution of 480 TV lines. The schematic of this device is shown. The image area is 6.45 (H) mm*4.84 (V) mm. The number of pixels without optical blacks is 768 (H) *494 (V), and the size is 8.4 (H) mu m*9.8 (V) mu m. These specifications are suitable for 1/2-in lens format. To realize a PS-CCD, three techniques are used: three-phase three-level electrode vertical CCD, dual horizontal CCD with a compound channel, and dual-channel output. The characteristics of the image sensor are shown. 146-mV/1* sensitivity is obtained from one pixel for light with a color temperature of 3200 K and a saturation voltage of 600 mV. Smear is reduced to -86 dB. Horizontal resolution is 570 TV lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/1057/6932/00280052.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1993.280052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=280052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1/2-in 380 k-pixel progressive scan CCD image sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge-coupled image sensors","Charge coupled devices","Image sensors","Signal resolution","TV","Optical mixing","Optical saturation","Optical sensors","Lenses","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smear","horizontal resolution","CCD image sensor","progressive-scan interline-transfer CCD","vertical signal packets","ill-matched resolutions","480 TV lines","image area","three-phase three-level electrode vertical CCD","dual horizontal CCD","compound channel","dual-channel output","color temperature","saturation voltage","570 TV lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","displayDocTitle":"A 1/2-in 380 k-pixel progressive scan CCD image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4624961","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1/2-in 380 k-pixel progressive scan CCD image sensor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00280052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045524S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 1993","isNumber":"6932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1057","citationCount":"4","articleId":"280052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":280055,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The job of the subsequent stages is to decide where the analog signal lies between these two quantization levels. By passing both residues to subsequent stages, information is propagated about the exact size of the quantization step, because the sum of the two residues is equal to the difference between the two quantization levels (or an LSB of the quantizer).

Current video coding standards and their underlying algorithms use a variety of techniques to isolate and remove redundancies in the image sequence. Some of these techniques place severe demands on the underlying VLSI technology. Manufacturers of VLSI codecs have chosen a number of different architectural approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed in the context of various applications with examples taken from existing or soon to be announced products. The AT&T AVP4000 chip set is described in some detail. Major design challenges included CAD tools for simulation and verification, packaging and the control of power dissipation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6962/00280685.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.280685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.280685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=280685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of VLSI in multimedia","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Image coding","Video compression","Standards development","Video coding","Image sequences","Isolation technology","Manufacturing","Codecs","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","multimedia systems","image coding","codecs","data compression","circuit CAD","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","multimedia applications","compressed video","video coding","codecs","AT&T AVP4000 chip set","CAD tools","packaging","power dissipation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"The role of VLSI in multimedia","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4684171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of VLSI in multimedia","sourcePdf":"00280685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036596S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"280685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":280687,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The gate delay of logic I is reduced by 30-37% at the supply voltage of 1.5-1.0 V, and the gate delay of logic II is reduced by 40-85% at the supply voltage of 1.5-0.8 V, as compared to that of the conventional CMOS logic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.280693","startPage":"441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6962/00280693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.280693","endPage":"447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standby/active mode logic for sub-1-V operating ULSI memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Standby/active mode logic for sub-1-V operating ULSI memory","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4684179","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standby/active mode logic for sub-1-V operating ULSI memory","sourcePdf":"00280693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02935S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"280693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":280694,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Analog sampling systems based on switched-capacitor techniques offer performance superior to that of flash A/D converters and charge-coupled devices with respect to cost, density, dynamic range, sampling speed, and power consumption. This paper proposes an architecture with which sampling frequencies of several hundred megahertz can be achieved using conventional CMOS technology. Issues concerning the design and implementation of an analog memory circuit based on the proposed architecture are presented. An experimental two-channel memory with 32 sampling cells in each channel has been integrated in a 2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology with poly-to-poly capacitors. The measured nonlinearity of this prototype is 0.03% for a 2.5 V input range, and the memory cell gain matching is 0.01% rms.

This arrangement features a small 6F/sup 2/ memory cell, where F is the device feature size, and a relaxed SA pitch of 6F. The die size of a 64-Mb DRAM can be reduced to 81.6% compared with the one using the conventional folded BL arrangement. The BL-BL coupling noise is reduced to one-half of that of the conventional folded BL arrangement, thanks to the shield effect. Two new circuit techniques, 1) a multiplexer for connecting BL's to SA's, and 2) a binary-to-ternary code converter for the multiplexer have been developed to realize the new BL arrangement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.280706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.280706","startPage":"539","endPage":"542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6962/00280706.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open/folded bit-line arrangement for ultra-high-density DRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Open/folded bit-line arrangement for ultra-high-density DRAM's","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684192","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open/folded bit-line arrangement for ultra-high-density DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00280706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046868S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"34","articleId":"280706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":280714,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method is developed in the space domain, and Markov random fields are used to obtain a model of the distributions of dielectric features in the scattering region. In this way, a-priori knowledge can be easily inserted in the imaging scheme. This stochastic approach gives rise to a functional equation that can be minimized by using a simulated annealing algorithm. An iterative scheme is derived that allows one to bypass the need for storing large matrices in the computer. Numerical simulation results, confirming the capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed method, are reported. Solutions have generally been obtained in few steps, and seem better than those obtained by other imaging techniques in the space domain. The capability of the algorithm to operate in a strongly noisy environment is also proved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.280714","startPage":"293","endPage":"303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.280714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6963/00280714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave imaging based on a Markov random field model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280714/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave imaging based on a Markov random field model","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4679432","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave imaging based on a Markov random field model","sourcePdf":"00280714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040392S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"40","articleId":"280714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":280719,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

To eliminate spurious nonzero eigenvalues in the spectrum of the matrix operator, vector basis functions incorporating the Nedelec constraints are employed. Basis functions of linear and quadratic order are presented, and approximations made necessary by the use of the local RBC are discussed. Results obtained with linear-tangential/quadratic normal vector basis functions exhibit excellent agreement with exact solutions for layered circular cylinder geometries, and demonstrate that abrupt jump discontinuities in the normal field components at material interfaces can be accurately modeled.

Estimates of the vehicle's position and orientation are based on the rapid observation of visual cues located at discrete positions within the environment. The extended Kalman filter is used to combine these visual observations with sensed wheel rotations to produce optimal estimates continuously. The complete estimation procedure, as well as the control algorithm, developed are time independent. A naturally suitable quantity involving wheel rotations is used as the independent variable. One consequence of this choice is that the vehicle speed can be specified independently of the estimation and control algorithms. Reference paths are \"taught\" by manually leading the vehicle through the desired path. Estimates produced by the extended Kalman filter during this teaching session are then used to represent the geometry of the path. The tracking of taught reference paths is accomplished by controlling the position and orientation of the vehicle relative to the reference path. Time-independence path tracking has necessitated the development of a novel, geometry-based means for advancing along the reference path.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.280748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/6964/00280748.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"502","doi":"10.1109/9.280748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An autonomous vision-based mobile robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"An autonomous vision-based mobile robot","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4666759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autonomous vision-based mobile robot","sourcePdf":"00280748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054941S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"64","articleId":"280748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":280771,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"lastName":"Chun-Yi Su","id":"37087142370"},{"name":"Y.

The controller we use is memoryless in the sense that the discrete-time closed-loop system has the same McMillan degree as the open-loop continuous-time plant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.280782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.280782","startPage":"657","endPage":"661","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/6964/00280782.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel output gain margin improvement using generalized sampled-data hold functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel output gain margin improvement using generalized sampled-data hold functions","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4666794","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280782/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel output gain margin improvement using generalized sampled-data hold functions","sourcePdf":"00280782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038659S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"17","articleId":"280782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":280789,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

To simplify the protocol design task therefore, the authors propose an interprocess (point-to-point) communication mechanism that has the characteristic of instantaneous message passing. They first establish a hierarchy among synchronization properties, which shows that to ensure the logically instantaneous message passing property it is not always necessary to use a rendezvous mechanism. Next, they propose a solution to the logically instantaneous message passing problem that is more efficient than R. Bagrodia's (1989) rendezvous and K.J. Goldman's (1991) logically synchronous multicast in the point-to-point (single-cast) setting. This algorithm has the following properties: it is applicable without deadlock to the partner model in which each process acts as both client and server; it requires three control messages to send an application message, which is shown to be quasioptimum message complexity; and its worst-case response time from a send request to the occurrence of the corresponding send event is 2k/spl Delta/ (sec.), where k is the maximum number of interfering send requests and /spl Delta/ (sec.) is an assumed upper bound on interprocess communication delay. Furthermore, two modified algorithms are proposed: one for reducing the number of control messages required for an application message, and the other for attaining a shorter average response time by using a randomization technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.280800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.280800","endPage":"527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6965/00280800.pdf","startPage":"513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logically instantaneous message passing in asynchronous distributed systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280800/","displayDocTitle":"Logically instantaneous message passing in asynchronous distributed systems","volume":"43","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4684252","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logically instantaneous message passing in asynchronous distributed systems","sourcePdf":"00280800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039529S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","articleId":"280800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":280803,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

A single two-input exclusive-OR gate is often the only additional hardware necessary to allow a shift register to generate, by successive shifts, all of its possible nonzero values. The counting application requires that the number of shifts be recoverable from the LFSR contents so that further processing and analysis may be done. Recovering this number from the shift register value corresponds to a problem from number theory and cryptography known as the discrete logarithm. For some sizes of shift register, the maximal-length LFSR implementation requires more than a single gate, and for some, the discrete logarithm calculation is hard. The paper proposes for such size the use of certain one-gate LFSR's whose sequence lengths are nearly maximal, and which support easy discrete logarithms. These LFSR's have a concise mathematical characterization, and are quite common. The paper concludes by describing an application of these ideas in a computer hardware monitor, and by presenting a table that describes efficient LFSR's of size up to 64 bits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6965/00280803.pdf","doi":"10.1109/12.280803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.280803","startPage":"560","endPage":"568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximal and near-maximal shift register sequences: efficient event counters and easy discrete logarithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280803/","displayDocTitle":"Maximal and near-maximal shift register sequences: efficient event counters and easy discrete logarithms","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4684255","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal and near-maximal shift register sequences: efficient event counters and easy discrete logarithms","sourcePdf":"00280803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064915S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"280803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":280806,"authors":[{"name":"V.L.

As clock speeds and system diameters increase, this requirement becomes increasingly constraining on system designs. The paper describes a method that exploits properties of standing waves to reduce substantially clock skews due to unequal path lengths, for distribution network diameters up to several meters. The basic principles are developed for a loaded transmission line, and then applied to an arbitrary branching tree of such lines to implement a clock distribution network. The extension of this method to two- and three-dimensional distribution media is also presented, suggesting the feasibility of implementing printed circuit board clock planes exhibiting negligible phase shift over their extents.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salphasic distribution of clock signals for synchronous systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.280806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6965/00280806.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.280806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=280806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/280806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Salphasic distribution of clock signals for synchronous systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4684259","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salphasic distribution of clock signals for synchronous systems","sourcePdf":"00280806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032813S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"70","articleId":"280806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":280863,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Ways of providing these for the spheres as well are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.281092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.281092","endPage":"2904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7921062/00281092.pdf","startPage":"2902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjustable multi-tesla permanent magnet field sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281092/","displayDocTitle":"Adjustable multi-tesla permanent magnet field sources","volume":"29","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4674557","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable multi-tesla permanent magnet field sources","sourcePdf":"00281092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0333S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"7921062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"17","articleId":"281092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":281113,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The soft magnetic properties are not related to the Fe characteristics, but are closely related to the TaC characteristics, such as the lattice parameter and grain size. The film, composed of fine TaC grain with a small lattice parameter, has excellent soft magnetic characteristics at room temperature and its magnetic properties change little with temperature. On the contrary, the film composed of large TaC grain with a large lattice parameter has a large coercive force and magnetostriction at room temperature and exhibits a anomalous magnetic behavior at high temperature. The coercive force at 300 degrees C becomes ten times larger than that at room temperature. This phenomenon is most likely caused by the disappearance of the intergranular ferromagnetic coupling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.281113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7921062/00281113.pdf","startPage":"3049","endPage":"3051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.281113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous magnetic behaviour of nanocrystalline FeTaC films at high temperature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=281113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281113/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous magnetic behaviour of nanocrystalline FeTaC films at high temperature","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4674579","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous magnetic behaviour of nanocrystalline FeTaC films at high temperature","sourcePdf":"00281113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092672S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"7921062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"281113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":281134,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The instrument has 122 planar first-order gradiometers in dual units at 61 measurement sites. The SQUIDs are directly coupled to the read-out electronics, with amplifier noise cancellation to eliminate the need for separate preamplifiers inside the magnetically shielded room. The authors analyze the performance of the device and compare it with traditional axial gradiometer arrays by considering signal-to-noise ratios, spatial sampling theory, confidence intervals for equivalent current dipole fits, and information-theoretical channel capacity. The analysis includes the fact that instrument noise is smaller than the background activity of the brain; the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution of the planar array are in that case equal to or better than that of an axial array. The number of channels and their spacing are very suitable for neuromagnetic measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.281163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"3315","endPage":"3320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6966/00281163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.281163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 122-channel whole-cortex SQUID system for measuring the brain's magnetic fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SQUIDs","Magnetic field measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Magnetic shielding","Instruments","Signal analysis","Magnetic analysis","Detectors","Sensor arrays","Magnetic heads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques and instruments","biomagnetism","brain","magnetic field measurement","SQUIDs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain research instrumentation","122-channel whole-cortex SQUID system","helmet-shaped detector array","planar first-order gradiometers","read-out electronics","amplifier noise cancellation","preamplifiers","magnetically shielded room","axial gradiometer arrays","equivalent current dipole fits","information-theoretical channel capacity","signal-to-noise ratio","neuromagnetic measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A 122-channel whole-cortex SQUID system for measuring the brain's magnetic fields","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4679498","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281163/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 122-channel whole-cortex SQUID system for measuring the brain's magnetic fields","sourcePdf":"00281163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064675S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"76","articleId":"281163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":281240,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A new channel developed for the unshielded magnetoresistive (UMR) head that closely approximates a (1+D)/sup n/ channel at all but the very lowest frequencies and works well when used with DC-free modulation codes is discussed. This channel is an excellent match to the UMR head response, which has greater long wavelength response than the more familiar inductive and shielded MR heads.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.281381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6966/00281381.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.281381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6966","startPage":"4068","endPage":"4070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"(1+D)/sup n/ partial response channels for UMR heads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=281381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"(1+D)/sup n/ partial response channels for UMR heads","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4688848","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"(1+D)/sup n/ partial response channels for UMR heads","sourcePdf":"00281381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046956S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","articleId":"281381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":281386,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.J.

Historically, fuzzy rule bases have been constructed by knowledge acquisition from experts while the weights on neural nets have been learned from data. This paper examines algorithms for constructing fuzzy rules from input-output training data. The antecedents of the rules are determined by a fuzzy decomposition of the input domains. The decomposition localizes the learning process, restricting the influence of each training example to a single rule. Fuzzy learning proceeds by determining entries in a fuzzy associative memory using the degree to which the training data matches the rule antecedents. After the training set has been processed, similarity to existing rules and interpolation are used to complete the rule base. Unlike the neural network algorithms, fuzzy learning algorithms require only a single pass through the training set. This produces a computationally efficient method of learning. The effectiveness of the fuzzy learning algorithms is compared with that of a feedforward neural network trained with back-propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.281432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"332","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6967/00281432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.281432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation, completion, and learning fuzzy rules","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Training data","Fuzzy systems","Knowledge acquisition","Inference algorithms","Associative memory","Fuzzy sets","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","interpolation","inference mechanisms","computational complexity","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","completion","learning fuzzy rules","fuzzy inference systems","neural networks","approximating continuous real-valued functions","fuzzy rule bases","knowledge acquisition","input-output training data","fuzzy decomposition","fuzzy associative memory","fuzzy learning algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation, completion, and learning fuzzy rules","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4667091","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281432/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation, completion, and learning fuzzy rules","sourcePdf":"00281432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027137S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"118","articleId":"281432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":281501,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This article discusses modulation and channel coding issues related to digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB), such as data throughput, spectrum efficiency, single- and multicarrier modulations, interferences under simulcasting conditions, multilayer services, and DTTB coverage. Current advanced television (ATV) research for terrestrial broadcasting in the VHF/UHF bands is converging toward a fully digital implementation. In a digital ATV system, the digitized high definition video sources, with raw bit rate of up to l-Gb/s, are compressed using source coding techniques based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding. The output data rate of the video source encoder, with present technology, is typically 15 to 20 Mb/s. This data rate is sufficient to provide a satisfactory distribution quality video service.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.281578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"46","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/6971/00281578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.281578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital television terrestrial broadcasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital TV","TV broadcasting","Digital modulation","Modulation coding","HDTV","Discrete cosine transforms","Video compression","Channel coding","Throughput","TV interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication systems","television broadcasting","modulation","radiofrequency interference","image coding","discrete cosine transforms","radiowave propagation","high definition television","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television terrestrial broadcasting","television channels","service coverage","HDTV","channel coding","data throughput","spectrum efficiency","multicarrier modulation","single-carrier modulation","interference","simulcasting conditions","multilayer services","advanced television","VHF band","UHF band","digital ATV system","high definition video sources","source coding","discrete cosine transform","DCT","video source encoder","15 to 20 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Digital television terrestrial broadcasting","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4679835","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281578/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital television terrestrial broadcasting","sourcePdf":"00281578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065836S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"6971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"26","articleId":"281578","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":281579,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To determine whether such a system can be reliably deployed in the telephone company copper loop plant, a detailed model for loops and noise is presented. Results show that a sophisticated system, including echo cancellation and trellis coding, can reliably achieve CSA coverage, if T1 is not present in the plant. In the presence of assumed T1 worst case conditions, either the downstream bit rate must be reduced, or the operating range needs to be decreased to a serving area smaller than the CSA. A smaller \"mid-CSA\" serving area is proposed, and it is demonstrated that a 6.3-Mb/s ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) system can operate in the presence of T1 in adjacent binder groups over this smaller serving area, which is roughly defined by 6 kilofeet of 26 gauge and 8 kilofeet of 24 gauge. A statistical study utilizing actual T1 line data suggests that if CSA coverage is attempted in the presence of T1 in adjacent binder groups, a success rate of greater than 92 percent can be expected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/6971/00281584.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.281584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.281584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=281584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applicability of ADSL to support video dial tone in the copper loop","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Optical fiber devices","DSL","Telephony","Crosstalk","Very large scale integration","Bit rate","Companies","Optical fiber networks","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["television networks","subscriber loops","telecommunication services","digital communication systems","trellis codes","echo suppression","video signals","image coding","visual communication","cable television"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADSL","video dial tone","copper loop","ADSL-3 architecture","downstream payload","carrier serving area loops","telephone company Cu loop plant","echo cancellation","trellis coding","downstream bit rate","midCSA serving area","adjacent binder groups","statistical study","T1 line data","6 Mbit/s","6.3 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Applicability of ADSL to support video dial tone in the copper loop","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4684483","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applicability of ADSL to support video dial tone in the copper loop","sourcePdf":"00281584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031235S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"6971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"54","articleId":"281584","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":281602,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

This configuration is referred to as an \"LCL-type series resonant converter\". A simplified steady-state analysis using complex AC circuit analysis is presented. Based on the analysis, a simple design procedure is given. Detailed experimental results obtained from a MOSFET-based 640 W converter are presented to verify the analysis. A narrow variation in switching frequency is required to regulate the output voltage for a very wide change in load, and the converter has load short-circuit capability. It is shown that by placing the parallel inductor on the secondary side, the parasitics of the high-frequency transformer can be used profitably.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/6972/00281617.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.281617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.281617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6972","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=281617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of LCL-type series resonant converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance","Inductors","Circuit analysis","Switching converters","Hafnium","Reactive power","Magnetic analysis","Switching frequency","Frequency control","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","circuit resonance","insulated gate field effect transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LCL-type series resonant converter","inductor","high-frequency transformer","steady-state analysis","complex AC circuit analysis","MOSFET-based converter","switching frequency","output voltage regulation","load short-circuit capability","parasitics","640 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of LCL-type series resonant converter","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4678768","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of LCL-type series resonant converter","sourcePdf":"00281617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052436S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"97","articleId":"281617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":281801,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Unlike the standard erbium-doped silica fiber amplifiers, the fluoride-based fiber amplifiers display more uniform gain spectra. The benefit expected from fluoride amplifiers with multiwavelength signals has been experimentally assessed through comparisons in single- and cascaded-amplifiers configurations. Four db gain flatness was achieved with four wavelength-multiplexed signals extending over 23 nm after three fluoride amplifiers while 15 dB gain unbalance was observed after three silica amplifiers.

Associated with this machine, the authors propose a learning algorithm (LEAP), whose convergence properties are theoretically analyzed and whose performance is evaluated via computer simulations.

This result is then employed to prove that 2-D FIR lossless transfer matrices admit a minimal 2-D Roesser realization whose dynamics are parametrized by a single constant orthonormal matrix, which satisfies constraints ensuring that the resulting transfer matrix is FIR. This parametrization is used to compute the number of degrees of freedom available for the synthesis of a 2-D FIR lossless transfer matrix of fixed McMillan degree in each variable.

The authors propose a new model for realizing semantic interoperability among data items in multidatabase systems. In multidatabase systems, it is not easy to select appropriate databases and extract significant information for user's requests from many databases which are managed independently by its own database management system. One of the hardest problems is that it is difficult to judge equivalence or similarity between data items which are included in different databases. To select appropriate databases and extract significant information for user's requests, they have designed a meta database system. In this system. a mathematical model of meaning is used to find different data items with the equivalent or similar meaning or to recognize the different meanings of a data item. The mathematical model of meaning consists of: (1) defining a normal space, (2) constructing a class of projections which represents a phase of meaning, (3) constructing a mechanism to select a subspace of the normed space according to the context. The main feature of this model is that the specific meaning of a data item can be recognized disambiguously and dynamically according to the context.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RIDE.1993.281933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIDE.1993.281933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings RIDE-IMS `93: Third International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/911/6981/00281933.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings RIDE-IMS `93: Third International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=281933","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Database systems","Data mining","Electronic mail","Spatial databases","Computer networks","Books"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","database theory","distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidatabase systems","semantic heterogeneity","autonomous databases","semantic interoperability","meta database system","mathematical model of meaning","normal space","projections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical model of meaning and its application to multidatabase systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Apr 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 April 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4553124","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/281933/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical model of meaning and its application to multidatabase systems","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"00281933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02384S","chronDate":"19-20 Apr 1993","isNumber":"6981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"911","citationCount":"28","articleId":"281933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":281996,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The battery operates at room temperature, consists of nearly all plastic parts, uses conventional molding and plastic joining methods for construction, and is almost totally recyclable. Zinc/bromine is a low cost, rechargeable system with a potentially long cycle life. Recent advances made in computer modeling of this technology are also reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IPSS.1992.282047","startPage":"88","endPage":"92","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 35th International Power Sources Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1019/6982/00282047.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 35th International Power Sources Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSS.1992.282047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent developments in zinc/bromine battery technology at Johnson Controls","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zinc","Thermal management","Plastics","Electric vehicles","Power industry","Electrodes","Energy storage","Battery management systems","Power system management","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bromine","electrochemical electrodes","electrochemistry","secondary cells","zinc"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["developments","electric vehicles","electric utility","load leveling","applications","performance","bipolar electrode","energy storage","power densities","self-discharge","thermal management","molding","plastic joining","cycle life","computer modeling","Zn-Br secondary cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Recent developments in zinc/bromine battery technology at Johnson Controls","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4564974","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent developments in zinc/bromine battery technology at Johnson Controls","confLoc":"Cherry Hill, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00282047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026171S","chronDate":"22-25 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1019","citationCount":"3","articleId":"282047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":282100,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The ASIC is based on the Coordinate Rotation by Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm and will be fabricated with Honeywell's low-power, high-speed complementary heterostructure field-effect transistor (C-HFET) GaAs process. The CORDIC chip can be used for radar electrooptic sensor preprocessing and display coordinate transformation applications. It is shown how one CORDIC ASIC could replace several digital signal processors in, e.g., future synthetic vision systems. The C-HFET GaAs CORDIC has four times higher throughput than CMOS implementations of the same algorithm. Implementation of the same functions with off-the-shelf silicon ASICs would require four times higher power and yield 16 times lower throughput.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings IEEE/AIAA 11th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1033/6983/00282100.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings IEEE/AIAA 11th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/DASC.1992.282100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.1992.282100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-throughput CORDIC coprocessor for signal and display processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Application specific integrated circuits","Computer displays","Gallium arsenide","Application software","Signal processing algorithms","Throughput","HEMTs","MODFETs","Radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aircraft instrumentation","application specific integrated circuits","computer vision","digital signal processing chips","gallium arsenide","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","image processing equipment","satellite computers","semiconductor technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC coprocessor","application-specific integrated circuit","GaAs ASIC","nonlinear operations","trigonometric functions","divisions","multiplications","sensor preprocessing","display processing","Coordinate Rotation by Digital Computer algorithm","high-speed complementary heterostructure field-effect transistor","C-HFET","CORDIC chip","digital signal processors","synthetic vision","signal processing","military avionics","commercial avionics","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"High-throughput CORDIC coprocessor for signal and display processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-throughput CORDIC coprocessor for signal and display processing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00282100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039287S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1033","articleId":"282100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":282227,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A major driving force is the ongoing partial merging of television and digital computers in interactive multimedia services involving digital television and applications in areas like information (news), education, medical, entertainment, etc. A major target is to maximize interoperability of video services at all levels, including various resolutions, different transmission and storage mechanisms, as well as bit rates. This paper provides an overview of the current status in digital television, techniques used, future prospects, and research areas that need to be investigated. The maturity of compression techniques needed for digital video storage and transmission, and the establishment of international standards for digital television representation, like MPEG-2, have greatly contributed in this transformation. Recent developments are mentioned, including the American \"Grand Alliance\" FCC effort for digital terrestrial HDTV broadcasting, and also other efforts for digital television by cable and DBS. The concept of hierarchical multiresolution coding is also explained, and some of its techniques are briefly described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.282227","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6984/00282227.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.282227","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"510","endPage":"519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital television","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282227","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","displayDocTitle":"Digital television","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282227/","volume":"82","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4676108","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital television","sourcePdf":"00282227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031632S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"6984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","articleId":"282227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":282243,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

There are three classes of Viterbi decoders depending on the nature of the formatting of the data: continuous decoding with a finite path memory, blockwise decoding with a terminating tail (known to the decoder), and blockwise decoding without a known tail. The latter class is also known as decoding of tailbiting convolutional codes. In this case, a coded message begins and ends in the same state which is unknown to the receiver. The authors present a class of Viterbi algorithms for tailbiting convolutional codes. These algorithms are used in blockwise transmission to save the overhead of a known tail. They call the new algorithm the circular Viterbi algorithm (CVA). The basic ideas are: (1) continue conventional seamless continuous Viterbi decoding beyond the block boundary by recording and repeating the received block of (soft) symbols; (2) start the decoding process in all states; and (3) end the decoding process either adaptively or with a fixed length. Three robust adaptive stopping rules are constructed and evaluated. Simulation results and comparison to previously known algorithms as well as the optimum algorithm are presented. The amount of computation required for previously reported iterative algorithms tends to increase dramatically as the channel bit error rate (BER) increases. In one reported instance, computation increased by over 900% while decoded BER increased from 8/spl times/10/sup /spl minus/6/ to 8/spl times/10/sup /spl minus/3/. For the same example, the CVA increase in computation was 11.4% and the worst case decoded BER was 4/spl times/10/sup /spl minus/3/.

This overlay may cause two types of interference: 1) interference from the overlayed PCN on the FSM systems, 2) interference from the microwave system to the PCN users. In the first case, both analog and digital systems are considered, because they are both in operation in the above frequency band. Furthermore, for the digital microwave system performance degradation, most of the modulation methods employed for digital transmission are considered. In the second case, the performance degradation of both the forward and the reverse PCN links are investigated, and, for the forward link, two options are considered: 1) incorporating power control, and 2) a no-power-control scheme. Next, real Fourier transformers and notch filters in the PCN receiver and transmitter are employed, in order to minimize both types of interference, and the above analysis is repeated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.282269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6985/00282269.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.282269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlay of cellular CDMA on FSM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282269/","displayDocTitle":"Overlay of cellular CDMA on FSM","volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4684317","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlay of cellular CDMA on FSM","sourcePdf":"00282269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047845S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","articleId":"282269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":282270,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach is quite innovative since the analysis is carried out considering realistic spatial traffic statistics, which are characterized, even with a nominally uniform user distribution, by fluctuations resulting in uneven traffic loads on different cells.

Specifically, Wilkinson's approach (Schwartz and Yeh, 1982), an extension to Schwartz and Yeh's (1982) approach, and a cumulants matching approach (Schleher, 1977) are studied. The aim is to determine which method is best for computing the complementary distribution function (CDF) of a sum of correlated lognormal RVs considering both accuracy and computational effort. Then, using these techniques, the authors compute the outage probability of a desired lognormal shadowed signal in the presence of multiple correlated lognormal cochannel interferers. The outage results are presented as a function of the reuse factor. The reuse factor is defined as the distance between the centers of the two nearest cells using the same frequencies divided by the cell radius. It is a key parameter in the design of any frequency reuse system. Simulation results are used for verification and comparison. Overall, the results obtained show that among the three methods considered Wilkinson's approach may be the best method to compute the CDF of sums of correlated lognormal RVs (and hence the outage probability in correlated lognormal shadowed mobile radio environments). This is due to both its accuracy and computational simplicity over the range of parameters valid for practical applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.282277","startPage":"164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6985/00282277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.282277","endPage":"173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probabilities in the presence of correlated lognormal interferers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Outage probabilities in the presence of correlated lognormal interferers","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4684325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probabilities in the presence of correlated lognormal interferers","sourcePdf":"00282277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058059S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"199","articleId":"282277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":282290,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Two types of reluctance rotor structure, axially laminated and simple salient rotors, are suggested in the DEBRM development. Due to the unconventional pole number combination of the stator and rotor, performance evaluation of the DEBRM with different rotor structures is difficult. A comparison study of two rotor structures of the DEBRM is presented in this paper by finite element analysis. It is shown that by calculating selfand mutual-flux linkage of the dual stator windings as the function of rotor positions, performance of the complicated DEBRM can be evaluated conveniently.

Adaptive control strategies attempt to address the robustness issue by optimizing control parameters as changes occur in the plant. This paper investigates the genetic algorithm as one possible means of adaptively optimizing the gains of a proportional-plus-integral hydrogenerator governor. Previous work has shown that the genetic algorithm can effectively optimize the control parameters for a fixed plant. An enhanced version of the genetic algorithm, using the notions of diploidy and dominance, can be used to address the robustness issue. Here, changes in the conduit time constant as well as load constant are considered. It is shown that the genetic algorithm can effectively follow changes in the plant parameters, producing optimal control parameters in an adaptive environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.282490","startPage":"179","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/6992/00282490.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.282490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Robust control","Analog computers","Torque","Interconnected systems","Power generation","Stability","Cost function","Adaptive control","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric generators","machine control","tuning","adaptive control","optimal control","genetic algorithms","two-term control","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrogenerator generator governor","genetic algorithm","tuning","optimal control","Adaptive control","proportional-plus-integral control","diploidy","dominance","conduit time constant","load constant","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4703661","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive hydrogenerator governor tuning with a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00282490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046833S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"38","articleId":"282490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":282544,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Shiung Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Shiung Hsieh","id":"37087142165"},{"name":"Shi-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shi-Chung Chang","id":"37087148513"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1042-296X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-958X"}],"articleNumber":"282544","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282544","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Control system synthesis","Flexible manufacturing systems","Dispatching","Job shop scheduling","Production","Control systems","Testing","Processor scheduling","Manufacturing processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","goods distribution","production control","computational complexity","Petri nets","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadlock avoidance controller","flexible manufacturing systems","FMS","job dispatching","machine dispatching","untimed Petri net","bottom-up approach","controlled production Petri net","liveness condition","decomposition","controlled production subnets","minimal resource requirements","dispatching policy","polynomial time complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/70.282544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6994/00282544.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.282544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispatching-driven deadlock avoidance controller synthesis for flexible manufacturing systems","abstract":"This paper develops a new method for synthesizing deadlock avoidance controllers (DACs) that realize job and machine dispatching policies of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) into deadlock free control actions. Such controllers not only keep the FMS capable of repeating any of its operations, but also achieve a high resource utilization under any given dispatching policy. Our methodology is based on an untimed Petri net formalism. It consists of four ingredients: 1) a bottom-up approach for synthesizing a controlled production Petri net (CPPN) model of a FMS; 2) a necessary and sufficient liveness condition based on decomposition of the CPPN into controlled production subnets and the concept of minimal resource requirements; 3) a sufficient procedure to test whether the liveness condition is kept after a control action is executed; and 4) an algorithm that combines the test procedure with the given dispatching policy to generate valid and utilization maximizing control actions. We assess that this method is of polynomial time complexity and show that it results in a much larger class of controls than that of an existing deadlock avoidance scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4685412","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dispatching-driven deadlock avoidance controller synthesis for flexible manufacturing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispatching-driven deadlock avoidance controller synthesis for flexible manufacturing systems","sourcePdf":"00282544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041462S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"205","articleId":"282544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":282560,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Malloy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Malloy","id":"37281661000"},{"name":"E.L.

The key idea in our approach is to exploit the fine grained parallelism present in the instruction stream. In this context, schedules are constructed by a careful balancing of execution and communication costs at the level of individual instructions, and their data dependencies. Three methods are used to evaluate our approach. First, several existing methods are extended to the fine grained situation. Our approach is then compared to these methods using both static schedule length analyses, and simulated executions of the scheduled code. In each instance, our method is found to provide significantly shorter schedules. Second, by varying parameters such as the speed of the instruction set, and the speed/parallelism in the interconnection structure, simulation techniques are used to examine the effects of various architectural considerations on the executions of the schedules. These results show that our approach provides significant speedups in a wide-range of situations. Third, schedules produced by our approach are executed on a two-processor Data General shared memory multiprocessor system. These experiments show that there is a strong correlation between our simulation results, and these actual executions, and thereby serve to validate the simulation studies. Together, our results establish that fine grained parallelism can be exploited in a substantial manner when scheduling a sequential instruction stream for execution \"in parallel\" on asynchronous multiprocessors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.282560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6995/00282560.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.282560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling DAG's for asynchronous multiprocessor execution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282560/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling DAG's for asynchronous multiprocessor execution","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4704818","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling DAG's for asynchronous multiprocessor execution","sourcePdf":"00282560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042456S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"28","articleId":"282560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":282562,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This I(V) model presents an improvement in terms of load line prediction and limits for the high-power nonlinear circuit design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.282573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/6996/00282573.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.282573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new nonlinear I(V) model for FET devices including breakdown effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new nonlinear I(V) model for FET devices including breakdown effects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4685788","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new nonlinear I(V) model for FET devices including breakdown effects","sourcePdf":"00282573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029155S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"6996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"27","articleId":"282573","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":282575,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A large number of topology-dependent scheduling algorithms are available, in which changes of topology inevitably require recomputation of transmission schedules. The need for constant adaptation of schedules to mobile topologies entails significant, sometime insurmountable, problems. These are the protocol overhead due to schedule recomputation, performance penalty due to suspension of transmissions during schedule reorganization, exchange of control message and new schedule broadcast. Furthermore, if topology changes faster than the rate at which new schedules can be recomputed and distributed, the network can suffer a catastrophic failure. The authors propose a robust scheduling protocol which is unique in providing a topology transparent solution to scheduled access in multi-hop mobile radio networks. The proposed solution adds the main advantages of random access protocols to scheduled access. Similarly to random access it is robust in the presence of mobile nodes. Unlike random access, however, it does not suffer from inherent instability, and performance deterioration due to packet collisions. Unlike current scheduled access protocols, the transmission schedules of the proposed solution are independent of topology changes, and channel access is inherently fair and traffic adaptive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/90.282605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"23","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6997/00282605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.282605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making transmission schedules immune to topology changes in multi-hop packet radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Access protocols","Robustness","Packet radio networks","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Scheduling algorithm","Radio broadcasting","Spread spectrum communication","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet radio networks","protocols","mobile radio systems","scheduling","network topology","time division multiple access","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission schedules","topology","multihop packet radio networks","design problem","TDMA","CDMA","topology-dependent scheduling algorithms","protocol overhead","schedule recomputation","performance penalty","schedule reorganization","control message","new schedule broadcast","failure","robust scheduling protocol","topology transparent solution","scheduled access","multihop mobile radio networks","random access protocols","packet collisions","channel access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Making transmission schedules immune to topology changes in multi-hop packet radio networks","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4699939","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282605/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making transmission schedules immune to topology changes in multi-hop packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"00282605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032342S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"258","articleId":"282605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":282636,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

This is in contrast to other FPGA mapping techniques which start from Boolean networks. Each component part consists of single-bit or multi-bit slice of one or more closely connected RTL components and is realized using one or more CLBs. For this mapping onto CLBs, primarily function decomposition is employed. Conditions for some decompositions, disjunctive as well as nondisjunctive, useful in the FPGA context have been derived. As decomposition is a computation intensive process, some necessary conditions which are simple to check and eliminate a large percentage of trial partitions have been evolved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282636","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282636.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"FAST: FPGA targeted RTL structure synthesis technique","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4658328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAST: FPGA targeted RTL structure synthesis technique","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057431S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","citationCount":"5","articleId":"282636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":282639,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The size of the search space in the second phase depends on the desired image quality. For obtaining image quality comparable to the known tree (full) search based VQ, the proposed algorithm takes O(klogloglogN) (O(kloglogN)) time units, where N is the number of codevectors and k is the number of dimensions. In the proposed architecture, O(logloglogN) and O(loglogN) processing elements are used to obtain image quality which is comparable to those produced by the known tree search and full search based VQ, respectively.

Depending on the settings of its control parameters, SAGA executes as a genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing algorithm, or a mixture of these. SAGA represents an application independent approach to optimization, and the resulting search process is highly adaptive. The performance of the approach on the macro-cell placement problem is examined. It is experimentally shown that a mixture of the genetic algorithm with simulated annealing yields higher layout quality than a pure genetic algorithm. Furthermore, layout qualities obtained by SAGA on MCNC benchmarks are comparable to or better than previously published results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282687","startPage":"211","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282687.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAGA : a unification of the genetic algorithm with simulated annealing and its application to macro-cell placement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Simulated annealing","Computational modeling","Switches","Application software","Computer simulation","Computer science","Temperature distribution","Stochastic processes","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","genetic algorithms","circuit layout CAD","VLSI","integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAGA","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing","macro-cell placement","stochastic optimization algorithm","application independent approach","search process","layout quality","VLSI layout","MCNC benchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"SAGA : a unification of the genetic algorithm with simulated annealing and its application to macro-cell placement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4664694","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAGA : a unification of the genetic algorithm with simulated annealing and its application to macro-cell placement","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041986S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","citationCount":"27","articleId":"282687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":282690,"authors":[{"name":"G.N.

It is capable of treating (16/spl times/16)-blocks, with a displacement of /spl minus/8/+7 pixels. Serial data inputs save the pin counts and all the input data in current frame are read only once to keep the requirements to external units to a minimum. A simplified PE design reduces the computation to 1/3 of that by directly implementing the original algorithm without any influence on the performance. Simulation results show that pixel rates at about 150 MHz can be reached with 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. Owing to the highly regular and modular properties, the proposed architecture is suitable for VLSI implementation. Transistor count is estimated about 320,000, which shows that the architecture can be realized in a single chip.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282704","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282704.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture for HDTV motion estimation based on block-matching algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282704/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture for HDTV motion estimation based on block-matching algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4664711","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture for HDTV motion estimation based on block-matching algorithm","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063783S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","articleId":"282704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":282716,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

After reconfiguration, the logical neighborhood of the memory cells may no longer be same as the physical neighborhood. Test algorithms used after reconfiguration to detect physical neighborhood faults have to consider that (i) the physical and logical neighborhoods are different and (ii) the address mapping of the reconfigured RAM is no longer available. Another reason for distinct logical and physical neighborhoods is address line scrambling, done to minimize the silicon area and the critical path lengths. We present a test algorithm to detect 5-cell physical neighborhood pattern sensitive faults in reconfigured RAMs and RAMs with scrambled address lines. This algorithm is based on the widely used MSCAN and Marching tests, and requires only O(N upper bound/spl lsqb/log/sub 2/N/spl rsqb/) reads and writes to test an N-bit RAM. It also detects other faults such as stuck-at faults, decoder faults, 2-coupling faults, and 3-coupling faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm to test reconfigured RAMs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282719","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282719.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm to test reconfigured RAMs","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4664726","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm to test reconfigured RAMs","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031539S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","citationCount":"3","articleId":"282719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":282726,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The multiobjective approach, which models each objective by a scalar-valued criterion and attempts to find all non-dominated solutions, is a natural and efficient alternative to the conventional practice of combining all objectives into a single optimization criterion. In this paper we illustrate the multiobjective search approach MObj By applying it on two well known problems in VLSI, namely the scheduling problem in high level synthesis and the channel routing problem in layout synthesis. The efficiency of MObj and its linear space version SMObj is demonstrated by comparing their performances with multiobjective generalizations of the single objective strategies A* and DFBB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282726","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","startPage":"395","endPage":"400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective search in VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective search in VLSI design","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282726/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4664733","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective search in VLSI design","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044703S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","citationCount":"6","articleId":"282726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":282729,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Presently, most designers lack the resources or tools to consider simultaneously more than two of these dimensions (e.g. area and delay). In this paper, a new approach is presented which facilitates the simultaneous consideration of multiple dimensions to increase the likelihood of finding a globally optimum solution. Furthermore, the new approach enables the designer to explore a larger number of candidate solutions and to prune the design space before pursuing more detailed implementations. A formal definition of the new approach is given along with several examples that depict its strength in assisting VLSI designers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early exploration of the multi-dimensional VLSI design space","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1994.282729","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/930/6999/00282729.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1994.282729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=282729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/282729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Early exploration of the multi-dimensional VLSI design space","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4664736","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early exploration of the multi-dimensional VLSI design space","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"00282729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095007S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1994","isNumber":"6999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"930","articleId":"282729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":282742,"authors":[{"name":"Barton J.

The analysis, which is shown to be highly accurate through validation against simulation results, achieves its accuracy by (1) modeling detailed disk characteristics; (2) developing a simple approximation to compute the mean response time for fork-join requests arising in degraded mode operation; and (3) using a vacationing server model with multiple vacation types for rebuild mode analysis. According to this model vacations (rebuild reads) are started when the server (disk) becomes idle and are repeated until the arrival of an external disk request. Type one (two) vacations correspond to the reading of the first track which requires a seek (successive tracks requiring no seeks).

By using a general AC waveform in which the peak current density of the first pulse j/sub 1/ is fixed and the second is varied from +j/sub 1/ to -j/sub 1/, a continuous electromigration spectrum from DC through pulsed DC to pure AC conditions is obtained. Although an average current model fits the data well, there is a singularity in the median time-to-failure at pure-AC conditions. To avoid this singularity, a modification of the average current model, called the average current recovery model, is developed. It heuristically accounts for the degree of damage recovery during opposite-polarity pulses through a single recovery parameter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1993.283282","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1993","displayPublicationTitle":"31st Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1993","pdfPath":"/iel2/1027/7007/00283282.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1993.283282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC electromigration characterization and modeling of multilayered interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=283282","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/283282/","displayDocTitle":"AC electromigration characterization and modeling of multilayered interconnects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4657967","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC electromigration characterization and modeling of multilayered interconnects","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00283282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042691S","chronDate":"23-25 March 1993","isNumber":"7007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1027","citationCount":"56","articleId":"283282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":283288,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Strain reduces the three-dimensional symmetry of the lattice and helps match the wave functions of the holes to the one-dimensional symmetry of the laser beam. It can also decrease the density of states at the valence band maximum and so reduce the carrier density required to reach threshold. These two effects appear to adequately explain the TE and TM gain in compressive and tensile structures, including polarization-independent amplifiers, the behavior of visible lasers and the improved frequency characteristics of InGaAs/GaAs lasers.

Obtaining long lifetime, narrow far field, high power output in the fundamental transverse mode centered at 980/spl plusmn/5 nm, and planarity of the structure while maintaining low threshold current density (J/sub th/) and high differential quantum efficiency (/spl eta/) are the major challenges. Here, we report our work aimed at optimizing the design, growth, and fabrication of 980-nm lasers to address some of these issues. We demonstrate very low broad-area J/sub th/, of 47 A/spl middot/cm/sup -2/, operation up to 200/spl deg/C, and a very low linewidth enhancement factor of 0.54 of these lasers. We have also monolithically integrated 980-nm lasers with 850-nm GaAs QW lasers. To minimize coincorporation of nonradiative recombination impurities like oxygen and displacement of the p/n junction due to Be diffusion during MBE growth, we suggest that the Be doping should be dispensed with on the p-side of the GRIN region and the n-side GRIN region should be doped with Si. The optical properties of InGaAs QW's are insensitive to the type of the arsenic beam used, As/sub 2/ versus As/sub 4/. Although strained InGaAs QW lasers grown using As/sub 2/ at a constant substrate temperature as low as 570/spl deg/C have a lower J/sub th/, they also exhibit a 10-25% lower /spl eta/ as compared to the As/sub 4/. counterpart in which the AlGaAs cladding layers are grown at /spl sim/700/spl deg/C. To obtain a planar structure and to prevent the fabrication related defects, we have used a novel method in which the laser structure is first grown by MBE, and mesas are formed by in situ melt etching using SiO/sub 2/ stripes as a mask followed by regrowth of p/sup -/-p-n AlGaAs isolating layers by LPE. Compared to ridge waveguide (RWG) lasers, the buried heterostructure lasers so fabricated have significantly lower threshold current, higher power output; higher temperature operation, lower cavity losses, and kink-free light-current (L-I) characteristics, as expected. A CW power of 150 mW/facet at 986 nm was measured from a 400-/spl mu/m-long BH laser with 11-/spl mu/m active stripe width. A minimum threshold current of 2.5 mA was measured for lasers with 3.0-/spl mu/m active width and 300-400 /spl mu/m cavity length. The L-I characteristics of 500-, 800-, and 1300-/spl mu/m-long lasers with 3.0-/spl mu/m active width were linear up to the currents corresponding to a current density of 10 kA/spl middot/cm/sup -2/. At higher current densities, a sublinear increase of power with current was observed. Stable fundamental transverse mode operation was obtained up to 100-mW emitted power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.283790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.283790","startPage":"424","endPage":"440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/7019/00283790.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Growth and fabrication of high-performance 980-nm strained InGaAs quantum-well lasers for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Growth and fabrication of high-performance 980-nm strained InGaAs quantum-well lasers for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4717640","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/283790/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Growth and fabrication of high-performance 980-nm strained InGaAs quantum-well lasers for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00283790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10556S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"34","articleId":"283790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":283797,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.A.

The parameters investigated include the temperature characteristics of threshold current, quantum efficiency, and modulation speed. To prevent carrier overflow under high-temperature operation, the electron confinement energy is increased by using the Al/sub x/Ga/sub y/In/sub 1-x-y/As/InP material system instead of the conventional Ga/sub x/In/sub 1-x/As/sub y/P/sub 1-y//InP material system. To reduce the transparency current and the carrier-density-dependent loss due to the intervalence-band absorption, strained-layer quantum wells are chosen as the active layer. Experimentally, 1.3-/spl mu/m compressive-strained five-quantum-well lasers and tensile-strained three-quantum-well lasers were fabricated using a 3-/spl mu/m wide ridge-waveguide laser structure. For both types of lasers, the intrinsic material parameters are found to be similar in magnitude and in temperature dependence if they are normalized to each well. Specifically, the compressive-strained five-quantum-well lasers show excellent extrinsic temperature characteristics, such as small drop of 0.3 dB in differential quantum efficiency when the heat sink temperature changes from 25 to 100/spl deg/C, and a large small-signal modulation bandwidth of 8.6 GHz at 85/spl deg/C. The maximum 3 dB modulation bandwidth was measured to be 19.6 GHz for compressive-strained lasers and 17 GHz for tensile-strained-lasers by an optical modulation technique. The strong carrier confinement also results in a small k-factor (0.25 ns) which indicates the potential for high-speed modulation up to 35 GHz. In spite of the aluminum-containing active layer, no catastrophic optical damage was observed at room temperature up to 218 mW for compressive-strained five-quantum-well lasers and 103 mW for tensile-strained three-quantum-well lasers. For operating the compressive-strained five-quantum-well lasers at 85/spl deg/C with more than 5 mW output power, a mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of 9.4 years is projected from a preliminary life test. These lasers are highly attractive for uncooled, potentially low-cost applications in the subscriber loop.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.283799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/7019/00283799.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.283799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=283799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance uncooled 1.3-/spl mu/m Al/sub x/Ga/sub y/In/sub 1-x-y/As/InP strained-layer quantum-well lasers for subscriber loop applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-performance uncooled 1.3-/spl mu/m Al/sub x/Ga/sub y/In/sub 1-x-y/As/InP strained-layer quantum-well lasers for subscriber loop applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/283799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4717648","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance uncooled 1.3-/spl mu/m Al/sub x/Ga/sub y/In/sub 1-x-y/As/InP strained-layer quantum-well lasers for subscriber loop applications","sourcePdf":"00283799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066722S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"304","articleId":"283799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":283803,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We consider a model InGaAs/InGaAsP/InP laser structure and investigate how the lasing characteristics change as the conduction band line-up moves from being type I to type II. We find for modest type II offsets (up to /spl ap/50 meV) and a typical well width of 100 /spl Aring/ that the transparency carrier densities are larger than comparable type I structures, and that the differential gain degrades only gradually. We also calculate the 2-D carrier density at transparency and threshold and the radiative component of the current density for InGaAs/InGaAsP lasers with both compressive and tensile strained quantum wells emitting around 1.5 /spl mu/m. We find that the mechanisms by which threshold current is reduced are different in tensile and compressive laser structures. We see that the radiative current decreases with increasing tension even in the situation where the conduction band offset is expected to be type II, with only a modest increase in 2-D carrier density. This suggests that the total threshold current density of these lasers should decrease in the type II region, in contradiction to the available experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current density","Indium gallium arsenide","Laser modes","Quantum well lasers","Charge carrier density","Threshold current","Carrier confinement","Electrons","Indium phosphide","Laser transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier density","transparency","conduction bands","semiconductor lasers","gallium arsenide","indium compounds","III-V semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensile strained quantum wells","radiative current density","compressive strained quantum wells","electrostatically confined electron states","InGaAs/InGaAsP/InP laser","conduction band","transparency carrier densities","differential gain","2D carrier density","type II offset","type I offset","threshold current density","1.5 micron","InGaAs-InGaAsP-InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.283803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/7019/00283803.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.283803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain and radiative current density in InGaAs/lnGaAsP lasers with electrostatically confined electron states","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=283803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gain and radiative current density in InGaAs/lnGaAsP lasers with electrostatically confined electron states","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/283803/","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4717652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain and radiative current density in InGaAs/lnGaAsP lasers with electrostatically confined electron states","sourcePdf":"00283803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039905S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"29","articleId":"283803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":283804,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Test engineers initiated a series of artificial short-circuit faults to test the line installation. As an experiment, the steady-state and transient responses of the power system were recorded. During testing of the new California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP), a PMU was installed at Olinda Substation near Redding, CA, and at Tracy Substation, near San Francisco, CA roughly 320 kilometers apart. PMU (phasor measurement unit) is a new measuring unit that recorded power system voltages and currents at the two substations. The PMUs use a navigational satellite system to synchronize digital sampling at different substations. That summer the data was analysed using modem digital signal processing software. In this article the author compares actual field measurements of the steady-state pre-fault power system angle with a classic relation for calculating real power flow on a transmission line. The agreement between the state-of-the-art measurements and the classic calculations was very close.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/283885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4717517","displayDocTitle":"PMUs [phasor measurement unit]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PMUs [phasor measurement unit]","sourcePdf":"00283885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073274S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"7022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"45","citationCount":"30","articleId":"283885","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":284046,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The three algorithms are used to solve the mapping problem, which is the optimal static allocation of communication processes on distributed memory architectures. Each algorithm is independently evaluated and optimized according to its parameters. The parallelization of the algorithms is also considered. As an example, a massively parallel genetic algorithm is proposed for the problem, and results of its implementation on a 128-processor Supernode are given. A comparative study of the algorithms is then carried out. The criteria of performance considered are the quality of the solutions obtained and the amount of search time used for several benchmarks.

A parallel programming model is presented that expresses the net characteristics of parallelism, locality, decentralized conflict adjudication and nondeterminism in a natural and efficient way. The programming model consists of a general net class, a net representation, and an execution scheme. The net class is based on the idea of generalized computation nets (GCNs). A GCN is represented for distributed execution by a program graph. The basic functions defined for graph evaluation realize the concept of update-driven data flow. The execution scheme guarantees the preservation of the correspondence of a graph marking to the net marking after node executions. The scheme is based on levelizing the graph's nodes so that the nodes located on the same level can be executed in parallel and without any constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1993.284109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1993.284109","startPage":"204","endPage":"213 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/449/7025/00284109.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7025","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00284109.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Update-data-driven execution of nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Update-data-driven execution of nets","conferenceDate":"8-8 Jan. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4602135","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284109/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Update-data-driven execution of nets","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00284109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050404S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","isNumber":"7025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"449","articleId":"284109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":284239,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results also encourage the development of a general input set to represent size-related features of graph-based system descriptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1993.284242","startPage":"626","endPage":"634 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1993.284242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7026","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/449/7026/00284242.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in specification level software size estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284242/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in specification level software size estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"iv","accessionNumber":"4618273","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-8 Jan. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in specification level software size estimation","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00284242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05553S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","isNumber":"7026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"449","citationCount":"7","articleId":"284242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":284243,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The focus of the investigation is the prediction of overbooking rates in order to avoid a situation where an aircraft departs with empty seats when passengers who have booked seat do not participate in the flight. The neural network proposed to solve the problem is an extension of the forward-only counterpropagation model. The network learns to approximate the mapping between the input data (the number of booked seats for each reservation class at distinct time periods prior to departure) and the desired output (the number of no-shows). The trained network is then used to make the predictions for the future.

They have developed a parallel algorithm of adaptive mesh generation that recursively bisects mesh elements by increasing the number of mesh nodes according to local surface properties, such as surface orientation, curvature and color. The recursive subdivision based on such a viewpoint-invariant feature yields the hierarchical surface triangulation that is intrinsic to the surface, and satisfies the absolute accuracy criterion, because nodes are generated as many times as required until the entire surface has been approximated with a given threshold.

Important performance specifications for such systems include voltage regulation, total harmonic distortion, output impedance, transient response and operation with nonlinear loads. The most significant factors affecting the overall performance of the system are the power converter topology and the control or modulation strategy used. The most popular approach for realising such converters is through the use of voltage source DC link inverters operated with an LC output filter. The inverter is typically operated with a pulse width modulated strategy under feedback control to realise the desired output waveform. The output power rating and the output distortion specifications are generally used as the basis for the choice of switching frequency and LC filter size. The regulation quality of the output voltage is arguably the most important specification of the UPS system. Regulation quality will depend on the control strategy used. This paper reviews the analogue and digital control strategies used for realising sinusoidal ouput UPS systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"15 Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284623/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4653300","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"15-15 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Control of UPS inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of UPS inverters","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00284623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02741S","chronDate":"15 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7037","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1333","citationCount":"7","articleId":"284623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":284672,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.C.

Offset is reduced by digitally adjusting the bias voltage of a programmable current mirror which is used as the load of the differential input stage. A 100% operating duty cycle is obtained by using a ping-pong structure. The offset compensation scheme is inherently time and temperature stable since the offset compensation is periodically performed with the ping-pong control.

The use of identical unit capacitors to form larger capacitances can easily produce 1% accuracy, but, in many cases, 0.1% accuracy can provide important performance advantages. Unfortunately, the ultimate matching precision of the ratio is limited by a number of systematic and random error sources. We have analyzed the source and significance of the systematic error sources on actual integrated circuit layouts and isolated five key contributors. Based on this analysis, we have developed a list of generic layout rules and a layout scheme that predict matching accuracies better than 0.1% for the individual systematic error sources using capacitor sizes in the range of 20-40 /spl mu/m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.284714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7045/00284714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.284714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7045","startPage":"611","endPage":"616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic capacitance matching errors and corrective layout procedures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=284714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic capacitance matching errors and corrective layout procedures","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4702917","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic capacitance matching errors and corrective layout procedures","sourcePdf":"00284714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033212S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"101","articleId":"284714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":284719,"authors":[{"name":"D.

To answer these two types of stability problems, we introduce two new notions of traffic characterization: minimum envelope rate (MER) and MER with respect to /spl theta/. We also develop a set of rules for network operations such as superposition, input-output relation of a single queue, and routing. Specifically, we show that: 1) the MER of a superposition process is less than or equal to the sum of the MER of each process, 2) a queue is stable in the sense of bounded queue length if the MER of the input traffic is smaller than the capacity, 3) the MER of a departure process from a stable queue is less than or equal to that of the input process, and 4) the MER of a routed process from a departure process is less than or equal to the MER of the departure process multiplied by the MER of the routing process. Similar results hold for MER with respect to /spl theta/ under a further assumption of independence. For single class networks with nonfeedforward routing, we provide a new method to show that similar stability results hold for such networks under the first come, first served policy. Moreover, when restricting to the family of two-state Markov modulated arrival processes, the notion of MER with respect to /spl theta/ is shown to be equivalent to the recently developed notion of effective bandwidth in communication networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","volume":"39","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4702843","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stability, queue length, and delay of deterministic and stochastic queueing networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability, queue length, and delay of deterministic and stochastic queueing networks","sourcePdf":"00284868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03466S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"605","articleId":"284868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":284878,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Most prior work in control has used friction models which depend only on the current value of velocity. This type of analysis indicates that stick-slip can be avoided only through velocity feedback. The tribology literature, however, indicates that friction also depends on the history of motion. By including this dependence, a second regime of stable motion is revealed which is associated with position feedback gains above a critical value. Two experimentally-based dynamic friction models are compared using a linearized stability analysis. In accord with experiment, a state variable friction model exhibits asymptotically stable motion for any system stiffness (position feedback gain) exceeding a critical value. This property is not exhibited by a time-lag friction model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.284901","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7049/00284901.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.284901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avoiding stick-slip through PD control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Avoiding stick-slip through PD control","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4702875","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avoiding stick-slip through PD control","sourcePdf":"00284901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038957S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"119","articleId":"284901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":284927,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed from each amplitude estimate (deviations about the mean value of the estimate were considered as noise). A moving average root mean square estimator (245 ms window) provided an average/spl plusmn/standard deviation (A/spl plusmn/SD) SNR of 10.7/spl plusmn/3.3 for the individual recordings. Temporal whitening with one fourth-order whitening filter designed per site improved the A/spl plusmn/SD SNR to 17.6/spl plusmn/6.0.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.284927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.284927","startPage":"159","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7050/00284927.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single site electromyograph amplitude estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Single site electromyograph amplitude estimation","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4697765","pubMedId":"8026849","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284927/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single site electromyograph amplitude estimation","sourcePdf":"00284927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033406S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"71","articleId":"284927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":284959,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

These two techniques require stationarity of the signal during a finite interval. This requirement imposes some limitations on the distribution estimate. In the present study, three new techniques for nonstationary signal analysis (the Choi-Williams distribution, a reduced interference distribution, and the Bessel distribution) were tested to determine their advantages and limitations for analysis of the Doppler blood flow signal of the femoral artery. For the purpose of comparison, a model simulating the quadrature Doppler signal was developed, and the parameters of each technique were optimized based on the theoretical distribution. Distributions computed using these new techniques were assessed and compared with those computed using the short-time Fourier transform and autoregressive modeling. Three indexes, the correlation coefficient, the integrated squared error, and the normalized root-mean-squared error of the mean frequency waveform, were used to evaluate the performance of each technique. The results showed that the Bessel distribution performed the best, but the Choi-Williams distribution and autoregressive modeling are also techniques which can generate good time-frequency distributions of Doppler signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of time-frequency distribution techniques for analysis of simulated Doppler ultrasound signals of the femoral artery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.284961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7052/00284961.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.284961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=284961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of time-frequency distribution techniques for analysis of simulated Doppler ultrasound signals of the femoral artery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4717601","pubMedId":"8063299","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of time-frequency distribution techniques for analysis of simulated Doppler ultrasound signals of the femoral artery","sourcePdf":"00284961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045545S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"7052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"64","articleId":"284961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":284964,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

The programs are capable of detecting and classifying the spikes from multiple, simultaneously active neurons, even in situations where there is a high degree of spike waveform superposition on the recording channels. The protocols are based on the derivation of an optimal linear filter for each individual neuron. Each filter is tuned to selectively respond to the spike waveform generated by the corresponding neuron, and to attenuate noise and the spike waveforms from all other neurons. The protocol is essentially an extension of earlier work (S. Andreassen et al., 1979; W.M. Roberts and D.K. Hartline, 1975; R.B. Stein et al., 1979). However, the protocols extend the power and utility of the original implementations in two significant respects. First, a general single-pass automatic template estimation algorithm was derived and implemented. Second, the filters were implemented within a software environment providing a greatly enhanced functional organization and user interface. The utility of the analysis approach was demonstrated on samples of multiunit electrophysiological recordings from the cricket abdominal nerve cord.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.284964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7052/00284964.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.284964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal discrimination and classification of neuronal action potential waveforms from multiunit, multichannel recordings using software-based linear filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=284964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/284964/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal discrimination and classification of neuronal action potential waveforms from multiunit, multichannel recordings using software-based linear filters","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4713084","pubMedId":"8063302","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal discrimination and classification of neuronal action potential waveforms from multiunit, multichannel recordings using software-based linear filters","sourcePdf":"00284964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046126S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"7052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"56","articleId":"284964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":284968,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The model provides explicit expressions of the threshold voltage and threshold surface potential, which may no longer be assumed to be pinned at the limit of strong inversion, and demonstrates the nearly ideal subthreshold slope of ultrathin double-gate SOI transistors.

This technique combines effectively the method of lines with the mode-matching method based on the theoretical principle similar to that of the space-spectral domain approach (SSDA). It can be applied to determine characteristics of various waveguide components and microwave integrated circuits such as resonant frequencies and scattering parameters. The framework of this technique is demonstrated in this paper through its applications to resonator problems. Absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) with two types of difference schemes were used to simulate unbounded space. It is found that numerical results of resonant frequency for the first two fundamental modes (quasi-LSM and quasi-LSE) are in good agreement with our experiments. Numerical results are presented for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous dielectric resonators as functions of different geometric parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined efficient approach for analysis of nonradiative dielectric (NRD) waveguide components","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.285075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7055/00285075.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.285075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"A combined efficient approach for analysis of nonradiative dielectric (NRD) waveguide components","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4702942","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined efficient approach for analysis of nonradiative dielectric (NRD) waveguide components","sourcePdf":"00285075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04607S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"285075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285107,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The encoder consists of a large codebook, so called super-codebook, where for each input vector a fixed number of its codevectors are chosen to generate a much smaller codebook (sub-codebook). This sub-codebook represents the best matching codevectors that could be found in the super-codebook for encoding the current input vector. The choice for the codevectors in the sub-codebook is based on the information obtained from the previously encoded blocks where directional conditional block probability (histogram) matrices are used in the selection of the codevectors. The index of the best matching codevector in the sub-codebook is transmitted to the receiver. An adaptive DFSVQ scheme is also proposed in which, when encoding an input vector, first the sub-codebook is searched for a matching codevector to satisfy a pre-specified waveform distortion. If such a codevector is not found in tile current sub-codebook then the whole super-codebook is checked for a better match. If a better match is found then a signaling flag along with the corresponding index of the codevector is transmitted to the receiver. Both the DFSVQ encoder and its adaptive version are implemented. Experimental results for several monochrome images with a super-codebook size of 256 or 512 and different sub-codebook sizes are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4703128","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic finite-state vector quantization of digital images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic finite-state vector quantization of digital images","sourcePdf":"00285150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062864S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"285150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":285152,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

An explanation of this limit is offered, which hinges upon the additive noise the sensor introduces into the image. Simple models of this noise allow lower bounds on the bit rate to be estimated from sensor noise parameters rather than from ensembles of typical images. The model predicts that an 8-b single-band image subject to noise with unit standard deviation can be compressed reversibly to no less than 2.0 b/pixel, equivalent to a maximum compression ratio of about 4:1. The model has been extended to multispectral imagery. The Airborne Visible and Infra Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) is used as an example, as the noise in its 224 bands is well characterized. The model predicts a lower bound on the bit rate for the compressed data of about 5.5 b/pixel when a single codebook is used to encode all the bands. A separate codebook for each band (i.e., 224 codebooks) reduces this bound by 0.5 b/pixel to about 5.0 b/pixel, but 90% of this reduction is provided by only four codebooks. Empirical results corroborate these theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.285185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7059/00285185.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.285185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible image compression bounded by noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285185/","displayDocTitle":"Reversible image compression bounded by noise","volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4708486","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible image compression bounded by noise","sourcePdf":"00285185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057439S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"34","articleId":"285185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":285188,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the MIMICS model, the forest canopy is divided into three regions: the crown layer, the trunk region, and the underlying rough ground. The crop cover situation is simulated by a rough ground and a crown layer composed of scatterers with different forms, distributions, and dielectric constants. The authors omit trunks from the final agricultural representation because these components are of the same order as the wavelength, contrary to the model's implicit assumptions. The simulation results are compared to ground based scatterometer data of wheat and canola. The paper describes the simulation results for the two crops at L and C bands and the two like polarizations. An analysis of the different backscattering mechanisms is also given for each crop. Good simulation results were obtained at L and C bands for HH polarization for both these crops throughout the growing season. An error analysis indicates that the soil moisture can be predicted with a precision better than 0.03 g/cm/sup 3/ for both crops, if all other model parameters are known. In addition, if the moisture is known, the height of the stems and the diameter of the leaves of the canola crop can be estimated with a precision better than /spl plusmn/5 cm and /spl plusmn/0.5 cm, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4708489","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of the MIMICS backscattering model to the agricultural context-wheat and canola at L and C bands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of the MIMICS backscattering model to the agricultural context-wheat and canola at L and C bands","sourcePdf":"00285188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050227S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"73","articleId":"285188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":285191,"authors":[{"name":"P.

During campaigns of the airborne version of the instrument, images of homogeneous cloud fields were acquired in polarized bands centered at 450 and 850 nm. The polarization of these images is analyzed. The bidirectional polarization distribution function measured in the 850 nm band is shown to make evident the liquid phase of the cloud droplets, by the large characteristic polarization of the cloudbows detected in backward scattering directions. The sensitivity of this feature to cloud parameters is discussed. On the contrary, for observation directions at about 90/spl deg/-100/spl deg/ from the Sun, the cloud polarization is negligible. In these directions, the polarized light observed in the 450 nm band is characteristic of the molecular scattering about the cloud, which allows the cloud top altitude to be derived. The feasibility of the method is analyzed and is tested on cloud pictures acquired at different altitudes above cloud fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.285191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"78","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7059/00285191.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.285191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the POLDER polarization measurements performed over cloud covers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Performance evaluation","Optical polarization","Clouds","Instruments","Light scattering","Image analysis","Distribution functions","Phase measurement","Phase detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clouds","remote sensing","polarimetry","atmospheric techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmosphere measurement technique","optical polarimetry","light polarization","POLDER","cloud","wide field of view bidimensional image","polarized light","airborne","image","homogeneous cloud","polarized band","droplets","microphysics","bidirectional polarization distribution function","cloudbow","cloud top altitude","method","cloud picture","450 nm","850 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the POLDER polarization measurements performed over cloud covers","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708492","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285191/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the POLDER polarization measurements performed over cloud covers","sourcePdf":"00285191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062803S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"55","articleId":"285191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":285193,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Supervised methods have yielded higher accuracy than unsupervised techniques, but suffer from the need for human interaction to determine classes and training regions. In contrast, unsupervised methods determine classes automatically, but generally show limited ability to accurately divide terrain into natural classes. In this paper, a new terrain classification technique is introduced to determine terrain classes in polarimetric SAR images, utilizing unsupervised neural networks to provide automatic classification, and employing an iterative algorithm to improve the performance. Several types of unsupervised neural networks are first applied to the classification of SAR images, and the results are compared to those of more conventional unsupervised methods. Results show that one neural network method-Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)-outperforms the conventional unsupervised classifiers, but is still inferior to supervised methods. To overcome this poor accuracy, an iterative algorithm is proposed where the SAR image is reclassified using a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier. It is shown that this algorithm converges, and significantly improves classification accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to radar image classification","doi":"10.1109/36.285193","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7059/00285193.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.285193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Radar applications","Radar imaging","Image classification","Iterative algorithms","Radar polarimetry","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","Synthetic aperture radar","Humans","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface imaging","remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique","neural network","radar image classification","ground terrain type","vegetation","classify","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","SAR","unsupervised","Learning Vector Quantization","LVQ","iterative algorithm","maximum likelihood classifier","algorithm converges","accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to radar image classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708494","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to radar image classification","sourcePdf":"00285193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044145S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"93","articleId":"285193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":285196,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

When the data must be geometrically registered over a reference map, and particularly when the output pixel size is not the same as the original pixel size, the quality of the resampling can determine the quality of the output, not only in the visual appearance of the image, but also in the numerically interpolated values when used in multitemporal or multisensor studies. The \"optimum\" interpolation algorithm for AVHRR data is defined over a 6/spl times/6 window in order to: consider overlapping effects among adjacent pixels. The response for each new pixel R(x, y) is determined as a linear combination of the response R/sub i/(x/sub i/y/sub i/) of the surrounding pixels in the window (i=1,36). The weighting coefficients /spl mu//sub i/ are calculated from the ground projection of the effective spatial response function for each AVHRR pixel, taking into account the particular viewing angle and geometry of the pixels on the ground. This method is intended to give an optimal interpolation of AVHRR scenes along all the scanline, in order to compensate for off-nadir radiometric alterations associated to the varying spatial resolution and the blurring introduced by the pixel overlaps. The optimum method, as mathematically defined, is highly expensive in CPU time. Then, a big effort is necessary to implement the algorithms so that they could be operationally applied. Two approaches are considered: a general numerical method and a pseudo-analytical approximation. A Landsat TM image corresponding to the same date of the AVHRR image is used to test the quality of the radiometric interpolation procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.285196","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"131","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7059/00285196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.285196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimum interpolation method applied to the resampling of NOAA AVHRR data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Pixel","Satellite broadcasting","Geometry","Radiometry","Remote sensing","Layout","Spatial resolution","Shape","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface remote sensing","measurement technique","geophysical method","optical infrared IR radiometry","optimum interpolation","resampling","NOAA AVHRR","geometric processing","satellite","image","pixel overlap","general numerical method","pseudo-analytical approximation","thermal radiometry","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"An optimum interpolation method applied to the resampling of NOAA AVHRR data","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708497","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285196/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimum interpolation method applied to the resampling of NOAA AVHRR data","sourcePdf":"00285196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055308S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"22","articleId":"285196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285205,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper we present a connectionist approach to the problem of block placement in the plane to minimize wire length, based on its formalization in terms of the Boltzmann Machine. We detail the procedure to build the Boltzmann Machine by formulating the placement problem as a constrained quadratic assignment problem and by defining an equivalent 0-1 programming problem. The key features of the proposed model are: (1) high degree of parallelism in the algorithm, (2) high quality of the results, often near-optimal, and (3) support of a large variety of constraints such as arbitrary block shape, flexible aspect ratio, and rotations/reflections. Experimental results on different problem instances show the skills of the method as an effective alternative to other deterministic and statistical techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.285242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"694","endPage":"701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7061/00285242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.285242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block placement with a Boltzmann Machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Computational modeling","Shape","Parallel processing","Iterative algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Concurrent computing","Hardware","Wire"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","simulated annealing","mathematical programming","Boltzmann machines","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann Machine","neural model","simulated annealing","massively parallel hardware implementation","connectionist approach","wire length minimization","constrained quadratic assignment problem","equivalent 0-1 programming problem","arbitrary block shape","aspect ratio","rotations","reflections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Block placement with a Boltzmann Machine","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4707211","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285242/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block placement with a Boltzmann Machine","sourcePdf":"00285242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044994S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","articleId":"285242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":285250,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Most previous analyses of CCS network engineering, performance evaluation and congestion control protocols generally assume an exponential holding time of circuit switched calls. Analysis of actual holding time distributions in conversations, facsimile and voice mail connections revealed that these distributions radically differ from the exponential distribution. Especially significant is the large proportion of very short calls in real traffic in comparison with the exponential distribution model. The diversity of calls (partial dialing, subscriber busy, no answer) and services results in a multi-component call mix, with even larger proportion of short time intervals between message-generating events. Very short call holding times can have a significant impact on the traffic stream presented to the CCS network: for calls with short holding times, the different CCS messages arrive relatively close to each other, and this manifests as burstiness in the CCS traffic stream.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7063/00285304.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.285304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.285304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling call holding time distributions for CCS network design and performance analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon capture and storage","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Switching circuits","Exponential distribution","Telecommunication traffic","Performance analysis","Protocols","Speech analysis","Facsimile"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication signalling","telecommunication services","protocols","telecommunications control","performance evaluation","circuit switching","probability","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["call holding time distributions","network design","network performance analysis","message traffic","CCS signaling network","traffic characteristics","circuit switched calls","network engineering","performance evaluation","congestion control protocols","exponential holding time","conversations","facsimile","voice mail","traffic stream","short holding times","probability distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling call holding time distributions for CCS network design and performance analysis","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4678936","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling call holding time distributions for CCS network design and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"00285304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086307S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"98","articleId":"285304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":285323,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The design of these linear structures, however, is made difficult by the manner in which their transfer functions are nonlinear with respect to their composite reflection coefficients. If we interpret the etalons as discrete-time lattice filters, then z-transform techniques may be used to recursively synthesize filters with desirable properties. An algorithm is developed which can be used to design the arbitrary all-pole transfer functions in transmission, and the restricted class of pole-zero transfer functions in reflection, which are possible to implement with this architecture. We present some design examples such as notch, or channel-blocking, filters and flat-top bandpass, or channel-passing, filters which are appropriate for frequency-division multiple access and wavelength-division multiplexed communications systems. The theory predicts, and we show experimentally, how these structures may be used to discriminate, or route, signals based on their modulated or coded characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7064/00285330.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"486","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.285330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.285330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightwave lattice filters for optically multiplexed communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Lattices","Resonator filters","Transfer functions","Optical resonators","Communication systems","Optical reflection","Band pass filters","Nonlinear optics","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibres","optical filters","optical transfer function","optical communication equipment","wavelength division multiplexing","frequency division multiple access","light interferometers","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightwave lattice filters","optically multiplexed communication systems","multistage etalons","resonators","linear structures","transfer functions","composite reflection coefficients","discrete-time lattice filters","z-transform techniques","recursively synthesize filters","algorithm","all-pole transfer functions","pole-zero transfer functions","in reflection","architecture","design examples","notch filters","channel-blocking filters","flat-top bandpass filters","channel-passing filters","frequency-division multiple access","wavelength-division multiplexed communications systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Lightwave lattice filters for optically multiplexed communication systems","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4679084","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightwave lattice filters for optically multiplexed communication systems","sourcePdf":"00285330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101348S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"69","articleId":"285330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285331,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Technol. Lett., vol. 5, pp. 669-672, 1993). In our scheme, linear loss in the fiber is balanced by a chain of periodically spaced, phase-sensitive optical amplifiers. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of pulse propagation in such a fiber line showing that, due to attenuation in the quadrature orthogonal to the amplified quadrature, it is possible for a pulse to propagate without significant broadening over lengths many times longer than the usual dispersion length of the fiber. An averaged equation for pulse evolution over distances longer than the amplifier spacing is derived. The effect of optical-phase fluctuations between the propagating pulse and the amplifiers is also considered. Since our proposed scheme does not rely on the formation of solitons in the fiber, it can be implemented in both the positive and negative GVD regions, and it does not require a minimum peak power for the pulses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.285338","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00285338.png","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7064/00285338.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"549","doi":"10.1109/50.285338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion compensation with phase-sensitive optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion compensation with phase-sensitive optical amplifiers","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4683920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion compensation with phase-sensitive optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00285338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044792S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","articleId":"285338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":285340,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

We use our theory to define the maximum number of recirculations in an amplified RDL with a pulsed source, where the fundamental noise floor is determined by the sp-sp beat noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.285340","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7064/00285340.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"582","doi":"10.1109/50.285340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise analysis of an amplified fiber-optic recirculating-ring delay line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Noise analysis of an amplified fiber-optic recirculating-ring delay line","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4683923","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise analysis of an amplified fiber-optic recirculating-ring delay line","sourcePdf":"00285340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027505S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","articleId":"285340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":285359,"authors":[{"name":"H.E.

The result is given in terms of the Marcum Q-function and accommodates the phase memory in the CPFSK signaling format; the impact of IF filtering on the signal, echo, and additive noise; the impact of reflections on optical amplifier noise; the non-Gaussian noise statistics at the decision moment; and the influence of laser phase noise. Sensitivity penalty results are presented for three modulation indices, both with and without intersymbol interference and phase noise, thus providing the first detailed insight into the impact of an interfering echo on CPFSK-DD receiver performance. Interferometric interference effects are observed independent of the accumulated laser phase noise between the main and echo signals, and it is concluded that a relative echo magnitude of 10% or less represents a good design criterion to aim for in a practical communication system. In all cases, the analytical results have been confirmed through extensive Monte-Carlo simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.285365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.285365","startPage":"678","endPage":"689","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7065/00285365.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of narrow deviation coherent optical CPFSK-DD with tight IF filtering and an amplified interfering echo","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of narrow deviation coherent optical CPFSK-DD with tight IF filtering and an amplified interfering echo","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4717346","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285365/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of narrow deviation coherent optical CPFSK-DD with tight IF filtering and an amplified interfering echo","sourcePdf":"00285365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048413S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","articleId":"285365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":285368,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This network is called an optical multi-mesh hypercube (OMMH) network. The OMMH integrates positive features of both hypercube (small diameter, high connectivity, symmetry, simple control and routing, fault tolerance, etc.) and mesh (constant node degree and scalability) topologies and at the same time circumvents their limitations (e.g., the lack of scalability of hypercubes, and the large diameter of meshes). The OMMH can maintain a constant node degree regardless of the increase in the network size. In addition, the flexibility of the OMMH network makes it well suited for optical implementations. This paper presents the OMMH topology, analyzes its architectural properties and potentials for massively parallel computing, and compares it to the hypercube. Moreover, it also presents a three-dimensional optical design methodology based on free-space optics. The proposed optical implementation has totally space-invariant connection patterns at every node, which enables the OMMH to be highly amenable to optical implementation using simple and efficient large space-bandwidth product space-invariant optical elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4717349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An optical multi-mesh hypercube: a scalable optical interconnection network for massively parallel computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optical multi-mesh hypercube: a scalable optical interconnection network for massively parallel computing","sourcePdf":"00285368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041269S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"48","articleId":"285368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":285388,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

These include magnitude and direction of target motion, target region dimensions, scattering media, ultrasonic frequency of interrogation, digital sampling frequency, and signal type (envelope detected or RF). Because the impact of scattering media in particular has heretofore received little or no attention, we provide experimental results and computer analysis to evaluate the influence of different scattering media on the accuracy of ultrasonic displacement and velocity estimates using porcine liver, porcine muscle, and woolen sea sponge samples. Our experimental results show that for identical target dimensions and displacements, the accuracy of ultrasonic displacement and velocity estimates in porcine muscle samples are substantially higher than in porcine liver samples. Analysis of experimentally derived autocovariance curves for each tissue type indicates that the improvement in accuracy for muscle samples is not, in fact, due to differences in the speckle characteristics for each tissue type. The improvement is attributed to the presence of well-defined and resolvable image structures from muscle and the lack of such resolvable structures in porcine liver tissue. We provide a summary of the factors impacting ultrasonic displacement and velocity measurements, and discuss why and how a combination of one or more imaging parameters affects these measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.285462","startPage":"293","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.285462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7070/00285462.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of various imaging parameters on ultrasonic displacement and velocity estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285462/","displayDocTitle":"The impact of various imaging parameters on ultrasonic displacement and velocity estimates","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4703712","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of various imaging parameters on ultrasonic displacement and velocity estimates","sourcePdf":"00285462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043916S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"22","articleId":"285462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":285463,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The proposed synthetic aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.285467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7070/00285467.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.285467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070","startPage":"333","endPage":"339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging: monostatic approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging: monostatic approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4703716","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging: monostatic approach","sourcePdf":"00285467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052095S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"106","articleId":"285467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":285471,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

Both problems may be studied by examining the output plane (output current versus output voltage) of a particular converter. It is shown that strict current source behavior is unnecessary for good current sharing in parallel-converter systems. Furthermore, a broad class of converters whose output voltage is load-dependent, i.e., those that have a moderate value of output resistance, all exhibit good voltage- and current-sharing characteristics. Such converters are often suitable for a/spl times/b arrays of converters that can meet a large range of power-conversion requirements. The output planes of discontinuous mode PWM converters as well as conventional and clamped series resonant converters are examined in detail. A simple small-signal model of the modular converter system is developed. Experimental confirmation of load sharing and the small-signal model is given for the clamped series resonant converter and the series resonant converter for various configurations of four converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.285492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/7071/00285492.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"50","doi":"10.1109/63.285492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output plane analysis of load-sharing in multiple-module converter systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Output plane analysis of load-sharing in multiple-module converter systems","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4703671","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output plane analysis of load-sharing in multiple-module converter systems","sourcePdf":"00285492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02673S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"7071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"52","articleId":"285492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":285495,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Stiff capacitively or inductively smoothed DC links in power electronic systems can be modeled as two-port transmission-line links using the TLM method. The TLM links enable the circuits connected by the links to be decoupled and simulated as individual circuits, resulting in smaller system matrices, possibility of parallel computation and reduction in computing time. Interaction between these linked circuits can be realised by exchanging the incident pulses at both ends of the transmission-line links.

Electric field redistribution leads to two dimensional effects, which must be included for accurate modeling of milliampere photocurrents.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7074/00285565.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.285565","doi":"10.1109/68.285565","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285565","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photodetectors","Poisson equations","Nonlinear optics","Optical buffering","Optical distortion","Optical mixing","Circuits","Charge carrier density","Neodymium","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photodetectors","space-charge limited devices","space charge","electric field effects","photoconducting devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high space-charge fields","microwave photodetector response","simulation results","p-i-n photodetector model","photodetector response","high optical powers","nonlinear effects","internal electric field","space-charge effects","photocarriers","position-dependent charge velocities","high-frequency response reduction","roll-off reduction","pulse narrowing","electric field redistribution","milliampere photocurrents"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Effects of high space-charge fields on the response of microwave photodetectors","accessionNumber":"4704645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of high space-charge fields on the response of microwave photodetectors","sourcePdf":"00285565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030343S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"100","articleId":"285565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":285567,"authors":[{"name":"H. de Waardt","affiliation":["PTT Research, Leidschendam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"H.","lastName":"de Waardt","id":"37279134800"},{"name":"L.F.

As complexity increases, it becomes necessary to impose explicit constraints on the control of planning, perception, and action to ensure that unwanted interactions between behaviors do not occur. This paper advocates developing complex robot systems by layering reactive behaviors onto deliberative components. In this structured control approach, the deliberative components handle normal situations and the reactive behaviors, which are explicitly constrained as to when and how they are activated, handle exceptional situations. The Task Control Architecture (TCA) has been developed to support this approach. TCA provides an integrated set of control constructs useful for implementing deliberative and reactive behaviors. The control constructs facilitate modular and evolutionary system development: they are used to integrate and coordinate planning, perception, and execution, and to incrementally improve the efficiency and robustness of the robot systems. To date, TCA has been used in implementing a half-dozen mobile robot systems, including an autonomous six-legged rover and indoor mobile manipulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.285583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/7075/00285583.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.285583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured control for autonomous robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285583/","displayDocTitle":"Structured control for autonomous robots","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4685420","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured control for autonomous robots","sourcePdf":"00285583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05193S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"182","articleId":"285583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285584,"authors":[{"name":"F.G.

This kinematic redundancy is very desirable since it allows mobile manipulators to operate under many modes of motion and to perform a wide variety of tasks. On the other hand, it also significantly complicates the problem of planning a series of sequential tasks, in particular for the critical times at which the system needs to \"switch\" from one task to the other (task commutation), with changes in mode of motion, task requirement, and task constraints. This paper focuses on the problem of planning the positions and configurations in which the system needs to be at task commutation in order to assure that it can properly initiate the next task to be performed. The concept of and need for \"commutation configurations\" in sequences of mobile manipulator tasks is introduced, and an optimization approach is proposed for their calculation during the task sequence planning phase. A variety of optimization criteria were previously investigated to optimize the task commutation configurations of the system when task requirements involve obstacle avoidance, reach, maneuverability, and optimization of strength. In this paper, the authors show that a \"minimax\" approach is particularly adapted for most of these requirements. The authors develop the corresponding criteria and discuss solution algorithms to solve the \"minimax\" optimization problems. An implementation of the algorithms for the authors' HERMIES-III mobile manipulator is then described and sample results are presented and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4685421","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Using minimax approaches to plan optimal task commutation configurations for combined mobile platform-manipulator systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using minimax approaches to plan optimal task commutation configurations for combined mobile platform-manipulator systems","sourcePdf":"00285584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05782S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"26","articleId":"285584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":285587,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Tien Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fan-Tien Cheng","id":"37272736500"},{"name":"Tsing-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsing-Hua Chen","id":"37348334300"},{"name":"York-Yih Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"York-Yih Sun","id":"37291598000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1042-296X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-958X"}],"articleNumber":"285587","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":599},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"Due to hardware limitations, physical constraints such as joint rate bounds, joint angle limits, and joint torque constraints always exist.

To take these physical constraints into account, the computationally efficient compact quadratic programming (QP) method is formed to resolve the constrained kinematic redundancy problem. In addition, the compact-inverse QP method is also formulated to remedy the inescapable singularity problem with inequality constraints. Two examples are given to demonstrate the generality and superiority of these two methods: to eliminate the drift phenomenon caused by self motion and to remedy saturation-type nonlinearity problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/7075/00285587.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.285587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.285587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resolving manipulator redundancy under inequality constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Manipulators","Torque","Quadratic programming","Robotics and automation","Jacobian matrices","Redundancy","Sun","Hardware","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratic programming","redundancy","kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator redundancy","inequality constraints","physical constraints","joint rate bounds","joint angle limits","joint torque constraints","redundant inverse kinematic problem","inverse compact quadratic programming","drift phenomenon","self motion","saturation-type nonlinearity problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Resolving manipulator redundancy under inequality constraints","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4685423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resolving manipulator redundancy under inequality constraints","sourcePdf":"00285587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045324S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"131","articleId":"285587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":285606,"authors":[{"name":"Xian-He Sun","affiliation":["NASA Langley Research Center, ICASE, Hampton, VA, USA","Department of Computer Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"lastName":"Xian-He Sun","id":"37087216683"},{"name":"D.T.

The word scalable, or scalability, has been widely and often used in the parallel processing community. However, there is no adequate, commonly accepted definition of scalability available. Scalabilities of computer systems and programs are difficult to quantify, evaluate, and compare. In this paper, scalability is formally defined for algorithm-machine combinations. A practical method is proposed to provide a quantitative measurement of the scalability. The relation between the newly proposed scalability and other existing parallel performance metrics is studied. A harmony between speedup and scalability has been observed. Theoretical results show that a large class of algorithm-machine combinations is scalable and the scalability can be predicted through premeasured machine parameters. Two algorithms have been studied on an nCUBE 2 multicomputer and on a MasPar MP-1 computer. These case studies have shown how scalabilities can be measured, computed, and predicted. Performance instrumentation and visualization tools also have been used and developed to understand the scalability related behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7076/00285606.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.285606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.285606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability of parallel algorithm-machine combinations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","Parallel processing","Parallel algorithms","Sun","Algorithm design and analysis","High performance computing","Concurrent computing","Application software","Computer architecture","NASA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithms","parallel machines","performance evaluation","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithm","scalability","algorithm-machine combinations","parallel machine","quantitative measurement","parallel performance metrics","nCUBE 2","MasPar MP-1","case studies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Scalability of parallel algorithm-machine combinations","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4704828","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability of parallel algorithm-machine combinations","sourcePdf":"00285606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039823S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"103","articleId":"285606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285613,"authors":[{"name":"Zicheng Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, USA"],"lastName":"Zicheng Guo","id":"37380576300"},{"name":"R.G.

These architectures are especially attractive if optical buses are used that allow simultaneous access by multiple processors through either wavelength division multiplexing or message pipelining, thus overcoming the bottlenecks caused by the exclusive access of buses. In particular, we define S-trees to include both binary X-trees and pyramids, and present two embeddings of X-trees into 2-D processor arrays with spanning buses. The first embedding has the property that all neighboring nodes in X-trees are mapped to the same bus in the target array, thus allowing any two neighbors in the embedded S-trees to communicate with each other in one routing step. The disadvantage of this embedding is its relatively high expansion cost. In contrast, the second embedding has an expansion cost approaching unity, but does not map all neighboring nodes in X-trees to the same bus. These embeddings allow all algorithms designed for binary trees, pyramids, as well as X-trees to be executed on the target arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4704835","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Embedding binary X-trees and pyramids in processor arrays with spanning buses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedding binary X-trees and pyramids in processor arrays with spanning buses","sourcePdf":"00285613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069607S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","articleId":"285613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":285621,"authors":[{"name":"O.T.-C.

The adaptive vector quantization method does not require a-priori knowledge of the source statistics and the pre-trained codebook. The codebook is generated on the fly and is constantly updated to capture local textual features of data. The source data are directly compressed without requiring the generation of codebook in a separate pass. The adaptive method is based on backward adaption without any side information. The speed of data compression by using the proposed adaptive method is much faster than that by using the conventional vector quantization methods. The algorithm is shown to reach the rate distortion function for memoryless sources. In image processing, most smooth regions are matched by the code vectors and most edge data are preserved by using the block-data interpolation scheme. The VLSI architecture consists of two move-to-front vector quantizers and an index generator. It explores parallelism in the direction of the codebook size and pipelining in the direction of the vector dimension. According to the circuit simulations using the popular SPICE program, the computation power of the move-to-front vector quantizer can reach 40 billion operations per second at a system clock of 100 MHz by using 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. It can provide a computing capability of 50 Mpixels per second for high-speed image compression. The proposed algorithm and architecture can lead to the development of a high-speed image compressor with great local adaptivity, minimized complexity, and fairly good compression ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.285621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077","startPage":"143","endPage":"157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7077/00285621.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive vector quantizer based on the Gold-Washing method for image compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An adaptive vector quantizer based on the Gold-Washing method for image compression","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4699550","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive vector quantizer based on the Gold-Washing method for image compression","sourcePdf":"00285621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065089S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"14","articleId":"285621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":285622,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Using the Wiener filtering concept and the statistical model developed by Chen and Pang (1992), the optimum filter that minimises the prediction error has been found. The result is expressed in an explicit form in terms of a correlation parameter, /spl rho/ and an inaccuracy parameter, /spl alpha/. It explains many current practices in MPEG and H.261 coders, as well as the leakage predictor, 3-tap versus 8-tap filters and other related issues. The analysis shows that minimum bit rate can only be achieved if the loop filter matches the statistical characteristic of the motion-compensated signal. Furthermore, since the motion noise characteristic could be very different in the horizontal and vertical direction for many sequences, the decision to deploy the optimum filter should be made separately in the two directions. The paper also derives the scalar loop filter in DCT domain. The scalar filter is sub-optimal, but it requires less computational load than the spatial domain filter (64 versus 484 multiplications per 8/spl times/8 block). Experiments show that it performs almost as efficiently as the optimum 3-tap spatial domain filter, thus ascertaining that its performance has not been significantly compromised by the scalar requirement. Experimental simulations on test sequences confirm the theoretical optimum results, and indirectly show that the simple statistical model used in the derivation is adequate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum loop filter in hybrid coders","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.285622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7077/00285622.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.285622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimum loop filter in hybrid coders","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4699551","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum loop filter in hybrid coders","sourcePdf":"00285622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021358S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"24","articleId":"285622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":285623,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.R.

This structure uses only half as many multipliers as the previous best known scheme (Liu and Chiu, 1993). The proposed architecture is regular, modular, and has only local interconnections in both data and control paths. There is no limitation on the transform size N and only 2N-2 multipliers are needed for the DCT. The throughput of this scheme is one input sample per clock cycle. The authors provide a theoretical justification by showing that any discrete transform whose basis functions satisfy the fundamental recurrence formula has a second-order autoregressive structure in its filter realization. They also demonstrate that dual generation transform pairs share the same autoregressive structure. They extend these time-recursive concepts to multi-dimensional transforms. The resulting d-dimensional structures are fully-pipelined and consist of only d 1D transform arrays and shift registers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal unified architectures for the real-time computation of time-recursive discrete sinusoidal transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.285623","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7077/00285623.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.285623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal unified architectures for the real-time computation of time-recursive discrete sinusoidal transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4699552","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal unified architectures for the real-time computation of time-recursive discrete sinusoidal transforms","sourcePdf":"00285623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056989S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"40","articleId":"285623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":285628,"authors":[{"name":"Shaw-Min Lei","affiliation":["Bellcore, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Shaw-Min Lei","id":"37331934000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"285628","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Asynchronous transfer mode","Error correction codes","Physical layer","Reed-Solomon codes","Broadband communication","SONET","Synchronous digital hierarchy","Local area networks","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","asynchronous transfer mode","packet switching","Reed-Solomon codes","optical links","image coding","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPEG2","ATM","asynchronous transfer mode","forward error correction codes","transport packet","FEC","cell sequence numbers","error patterns","scrambler codes","line codes","generator polynomials","single-error-correcting Reed-Solomon code","single-byte error patterns","double-byte error patterns","cell sequence number"]}],"doi":"10.1109/76.285628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7077/00285628.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.285628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward error correction codes for MPEG2 over ATM","abstract":"Transport of MPEG2 video and associated audio and data over ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks has attracted much interest.

Some of the desirable properties for VLSI realization are regularity, local connection and pipelinability. Lattice digital filters, which have many applications in signal modeling, spectrum estimation, and adaptive filtering, exhibit good finite word-length behavior, but cannot be pipelined to finer levels (such as bit or multi-bit levels) due to the presence of feedback loops. Although lattice filters can be pipelined by the cut-set localization procedure, it should be noted that the maximum sample rate cannot be increased by this technique. In the paper, based upon the properties of the Schur algorithm, a pipelining method in lattice digital filters is introduced, by which the sample rate can be increased at any desired level. By constraining the poles to be located at equal angular and radial spacing, the denominator of the transfer function is forced to be in scattered look-ahead form. It is shown that this transfer function satisfies the pipelining property of lattice filters. Furthermore, based upon state variable description, new methods for scaling and output roundoff noise calculations are introduced; these can be easily applied to lattice IIR digital filters or lattice IIR digital filters connected with other type of filters. The relationship between pipelining stages and the output roundoff noise is analyzed using first and second-order IIR filters. The use of pipelined lattice IIR digital filters in low-power applications is also demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelining of lattice IIR digital filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.285640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7078/00285640.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Pipelining of lattice IIR digital filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4704930","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelining of lattice IIR digital filters","sourcePdf":"00285640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042527S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","articleId":"285640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285641,"authors":[{"name":"B.L.

The authors extend the 1D rules reported by Crochiere and Rabiner (1983), especially the many equivalent forms of cascades of upsamplers and downsamplers. They also include rules reported by other authors for completeness. The extension to mD is based primarily on the Smith form decomposition of resampling (nonsingular integer square) matrices. The Smith form converts non-separable multidimensional operations into separable ones by means a shuffling of input samples and a reshuffling of the separable operations. Based on the Smith form, the authors have developed algorithms for 1) computing coset vectors 2) finding greatest common sublattices 3) simplifying cascades of up/downsampling operations. The algorithms and rules are put together in a form that can be implemented efficiently in a symbolic algebra package.

The ability to interchange the operations of upsampling, downsampling, and filtering plays an important role in these solutions. The present paper develops a complete theory for the analysis of arbitrary combinations of upsamplers, downsamplers and filters in multiple dimensions. Although some of the simpler results are well known, the more difficult results concerning swapping upsamplers and downsamplers and variations thereof are new. As an application of this theory, the authors obtain algebraic reductions of the general multidimensional rational sampling rate problem to a multidimensional uniform filter bank problem. However, issues concerning the design of the filters themselves are not addressed. In multiple dimensions, upsampling and downsampling operators are determined by integer matrices (as opposed to scalars in one dimension), and the noncommutativity of matrices makes the problem considerably more difficult. Cascades of upsamplers and downsamplers in one dimension are easy to analyze. The new results for the analysis of multidimensional upsampling and downsampling operators are derived using the Aryabhatta/Bezout identity over integer matrices as a fundamental tool. A number of new results in the theory of integer matrices that a relevant to the filter bank problem are also developed. Special cases of some of the results pertaining to the commutativity of upsamplers/downsamplers have been obtained in parallel by several authors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4704935","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On upsampling, downsampling, and rational sampling rate filter banks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On upsampling, downsampling, and rational sampling rate filter banks","sourcePdf":"00285645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035008S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","articleId":"285645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":285648,"authors":[{"name":"E.

When the systems that couple the signal and the noise to the sensors are unknown, the problem becomes one of joint signal estimation and system identification. The authors specifically consider the two-sensor signal enhancement problem in which the desired signal is modeled as a Gaussian autoregressive (AR) process, the noise is modeled as a white Gaussian process, and the coupling systems are modeled as linear time-invariant finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The main approach consists of modeling the observed signals as outputs of a stochastic dynamic linear system, and the authors apply the estimate-maximize (EM) algorithm for jointly estimating the desired signal, the coupling systems, and the unknown signal and noise spectral parameters. The resulting algorithm can be viewed as the time-domain version of the frequency-domain approach of Feder et al. (1989), where instead of the noncausal frequency-domain Wiener filter, the Kalman smoother is used. This approach leads naturally to a sequential/adaptive algorithm by replacing the Kalman smoother with the Kalman filter, and in place of successive iterations on each data block, the algorithm proceeds sequentially through the data with exponential weighting applied to allow adaption to nonstationary changes in the structure of the data. A computationally efficient implementation of the algorithm is developed. An expression for the log-likelihood gradient based on the Kalman smoother/filter output is also developed and used to incorporate efficient gradient-based algorithms in the estimation process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.285648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7078/00285648.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative and sequential algorithms for multisensor signal enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285648/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative and sequential algorithms for multisensor signal enhancement","volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4704938","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative and sequential algorithms for multisensor signal enhancement","sourcePdf":"00285648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045154S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","articleId":"285648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285650,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

The effect is caused by the perturbation of the presumed steering vector from its optimal value. Although it is not as widely known, similar degradation occurs in sampled matrix inversion processing when the covariance matrix is estimated while the desired signal is present in the snapshot data. Under these conditions, performance loss is due to errors in the estimated covariance matrix and occurs even when the steering vector is known exactly. In the paper, a new method based of modification of the steering vector is proposed to overcome both the problems of perturbation and of sample covariance errors. The method involves projection of the presumed steering vector onto the observed signal-plus-interference subspace. An analysis is also presented illustrating that the sample covariance errors can be viewed as a particular type of perturbation error and a simple approximation is derived for the expected beamformer performance as a function of the number of data snapshots. Both analytical and experimental results are presented that illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.285650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7078/00285650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078","startPage":"867","endPage":"876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4704940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","sourcePdf":"00285650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034244S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"340","articleId":"285650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":285653,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Cumulants of vector processes are defined using a Kronecker product formulation, and consistency of their sample estimators is addressed. Identifiability results in connection with the HOS-based parameter estimation of causal and noncausal multivariate ARMA processes are established. Estimates of the parameters of causal ARMA models are obtained as the solution to a set of linear equations, whereas those of noncausal ARMA models are obtained as the solution to a cumulant matching algorithm. Conventional approaches based on second-order statistics can identify a multichannel system only to within post multiplication by a unimodular matrix. HOS-based methods yield solutions that are unique to within post-multiplication by an (extended) permutation matrix; additionally, the multiminimum phase assumption can be relaxed, and the observations may be contaminated with colored Gaussian noise. Frequency-domain methods for nonparametric system identification are discussed briefly. Simulations results validating the multichannel parameter estimation algorithms are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.285653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7078/00285653.pdf","startPage":"898","endPage":"913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel ARMA processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel ARMA processes","volume":"42","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4704943","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel ARMA processes","sourcePdf":"00285653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065215S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"114","articleId":"285653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":285654,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

The TQR algorithm converges directly to the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix and was originally derived to provide a means to identify and reduce the effects of outliers for robust SVD computation. The paper extends the TQR algorithm to incorporate complex data and weighted norms, formulates a TQR-iteration based adaptive SVD algorithm, develops a real time systolic architecture, and analyzes performance. The applications of high resolution angle and frequency tracking are developed and the updating scheme is so tailored. A deflation mechanism reduces both the computational complexity of the algorithm and the hardware complexity of the systolic architecture, making the method ideal for real time applications. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the method and compare it to existing SVD tracking schemes. The results show that the method is exceptional in terms of performance to cost ratio and systolic implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A TQR-iteration based adaptive SVD for real time angle and frequency tracking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.285654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7078/00285654.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"A TQR-iteration based adaptive SVD for real time angle and frequency tracking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4704944","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A TQR-iteration based adaptive SVD for real time angle and frequency tracking","sourcePdf":"00285654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05614S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","articleId":"285654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285655,"authors":[{"name":"Leehter Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Leehter Yao","id":"37306585200"},{"name":"W.A.

To perform the analysis correctly from a mathematical point of view, the nonlinear autonomous model of the SPLL has been formulated as a fixed point problem. If the loop-filter is omitted, bifurcations and chaotic behavior can be observed. If the SPLL has a loop-filter, more than one attractor has to be used to describe the acquisition properties of the circuit. One of them is the fixed-point to be achieved, but the others are periodic orbits, i.e., false locks. The regions of convergence for the different attractors are studied and plotted as a function of the loop parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Sampling methods","Phase locked loops","Circuits","Switches","Frequency conversion","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Mathematical model","Orbits","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","phase-locked loops","bifurcation","sample and hold circuits","nonlinear dynamical systems","nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic behavior","sampling phase-locked loop","nonlinear autonomous model","fixed point problem","bifurcations","attractor","periodic orbits","false locks","loop parameters","nonlinear dynamics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/81.285692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7079/00285692.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.285692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior of the sampling phase-locked loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior of the sampling phase-locked loop","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285692/","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4690011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior of the sampling phase-locked loop","sourcePdf":"00285692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032566S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"11","articleId":"285692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":285696,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Nan Lin","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Allgemeine und Theoretische Elektrotechnik, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"lastName":"Ji-Nan Lin","id":"37366349700"},{"name":"Hong-Qing Xu","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Allgemeine und Theoretische Elektrotechnik, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"lastName":"Hong-Qing Xu","id":"37383401300"},{"name":"R.

Recently M-band orthonormal wavelet bases have been constructed and compactly supported M-band wavelets have been parameterized. This paper gives the theory and algorithms for obtaining the optimal wavelet multiresolution analysis for the representation of a given signal at a predetermined scale in a variety of error norms. Moreover, for classes of signals, this paper gives the theory and algorithms for designing the robust wavelet multiresolution analysis that minimizes the worst case approximation error among all signals in the class. All results are derived for the general M-band multiresolution analysis. An efficient numerical scheme is also described for the design of the optimal wavelet multiresolution analysis when the least-squared error criterion is used. Wavelet theory introduces the concept of scale which is analogous to the concept of frequency in Fourier analysis. This paper introduces essentially scale limited signals and shows that band limited signals are essentially scale limited, and gives the wavelet sampling theorem, which states that the scaling function expansion coefficients of a function with respect to an M-band wavelet basis, at a certain scale (and above) completely specify a band limited signal (i.e., behave like Nyquist (or higher) rate samples).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.285705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7080/00285705.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.285705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal wavelet representation of signals and the wavelet sampling theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285705/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal wavelet representation of signals and the wavelet sampling theorem","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4685919","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal wavelet representation of signals and the wavelet sampling theorem","sourcePdf":"00285705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040799S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"59","articleId":"285705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285708,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An interesting property on the design of minimum noise second-order sections embedded in the frequency sampling structure, is given. The results obtained show that the realizations via minimum noise structures and Bomar's structures greatly outperform the realizations via canonical direct form structures, and, for very narrow-band filters, have noise gain comparable to that of nonrecursive direct realization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.285708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.285708","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7080/00285708.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the realization of minimum noise and low noise frequency sampling FIR filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"On the realization of minimum noise and low noise frequency sampling FIR filters","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4690015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285708/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the realization of minimum noise and low noise frequency sampling FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00285708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040838S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"4","articleId":"285708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":285710,"authors":[{"name":"V.

First, a multilayer structure of polysilicon between two layers of low-stress silicon nitride is prepared on a wafer of silicon. Electrochemical anodization with an external cathode takes place in an RF solution. A window in the outer nitride layer provides contact between the polysilicon and the HF solution; the polysilicon layer contacts the substrate through openings in the lower silicon nitride layer (remote from the upper windows). Porous polysilicon growth in the lateral direction is found at rates as high as 15 /spl mu/m min/sup -1/ in 12M (25%, wgt) HF to be controlled by surface-reaction kinetics. A change in morphology occurs when either the anodic potential is raised or the HF concentration is decreased, causing the polysilicon to be electropolished. The etch front advances proportionally to the square root of time as expected for a mass-transport-controlled process. Similar behavior is observed in HF anodic reactions of single-crystal silicon. Dissolution of the polysilicon layer is confirmed using profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. Enclosed cavities (chambers surrounded by porous plugs) are formed by alternating between pore formation and uniform dissolution. Porous polysilicon also forms over a broad-area layer of polycrystalline silicon that has been deposited without overcoating the silicon wafer with a thin film of silicon nitride. The resulting porous layer may be useful for gas-absorption purposes in ultrasonic sensors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/84.285719","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/7081/00285719.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.285719","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","startPage":"10","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Porous polycrystalline silicon: a new material for MEMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Porous polycrystalline silicon: a new material for MEMS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285719/","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4729398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Porous polycrystalline silicon: a new material for MEMS","sourcePdf":"00285719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054044S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"29","articleId":"285719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":285741,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As the core of the area minimization step, we have developed a polynomial time optimal algorithm for computing an area-minimum mapping solution without node duplication for a K-bounded general Boolean network, which makes a significant step towards complete understanding of the general area minimization problem in FPGA technology mapping. The experimental results on MCNC benchmark circuits show that our solution sets outperform the solutions produced by most existing mapping algorithms in terms of both area and depth minimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.285741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.285741","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7083/00285741.pdf","startPage":"137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On area/depth trade-off in LUT-based FPGA technology mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285741/","displayDocTitle":"On area/depth trade-off in LUT-based FPGA technology mapping","volume":"2","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4705342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On area/depth trade-off in LUT-based FPGA technology mapping","sourcePdf":"00285741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072966S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"68","articleId":"285741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285745,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we address the problem of developing reliability driven logic synthesis algorithms for multilevel logic circuits, which are integrated within the MIS synthesis system. Our procedures are based on concurrent error detection techniques that have been proposed in the past for two level circuits, and adapting those techniques to multilevel logic synthesis algorithms. Three schemes for concurrent error detection in a multilevel circuit are proposed in this paper, using which all the single stuck at faults in the circuit can be detected concurrently. The first scheme uses duplication of a given multilevel circuit with the addition of a totally self-checking comparator. The second scheme proposes a procedure to generate the multilevel circuit from a two level representation under some constraint such that, the Berger code of the output vector can be used to detect any single fault inside the circuit, except at the inputs. A constrained technology mapping procedure is also presented in this paper. The third scheme is based on parity codes on the outputs. The outputs are partitioned using a novel partitioning algorithm, and each partition is implemented using a multilevel circuit. Some additional parity coded outputs are generated. In all three schemes, all the necessary checkers are generated automatically and the whole circuit is placed and routed using the Timberwolf layout package. The area overheads for several benchmark examples are reported in this paper. The entire procedure is integrated into a new system called RSYN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4705346","volume":"2","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RSYN: a system for automated synthesis of reliable multilevel circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSYN: a system for automated synthesis of reliable multilevel circuits","sourcePdf":"00285745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06107S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"86","articleId":"285745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285748,"authors":[{"name":"Lishing Liu","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

A classical method for designing set-associative caches is to late-select array data based on the results of cache directory lookups. The impact on the critical path timing due to late-select will become more significant in future microprocessors with very high clock frequencies. In this paper we propose a new approach to the optimization of array access timing for set-associative caches. The basic idea is to utilize a relatively small partial address directory (PAD) for fast and accurate approximations of cache access coordinates. The PAD can speed up most cache array access by accurately predicting cache locations without having to wait for results from conventional cache directory lookups. Occasionally when the PAD guesses wrong, a memory access can be re-issued with only 1-cycle delays. The PAD may be closely integrated with the array design. The effectiveness of the PAD method is analyzed through combinatorial and simulation studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.285748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7083/00285748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.285748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7083","startPage":"226","endPage":"240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial address directory for cache access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial address directory for cache access","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4705349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial address directory for cache access","sourcePdf":"00285748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046592S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"11","articleId":"285748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":285753,"authors":[{"name":"Choong Gun Oh","affiliation":["Department of CSE, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Choong Gun Oh","id":"37087703474"},{"name":"Hee Yong Youn","affiliation":["Department of CSE, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hee Yong Youn","id":"37087177839"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"285753","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=285753","abstract":"Fault tolerance has been one of the major issues for the VLSI based FFT networks.

The power dissipation in these flip-flops and single edge triggered flip-flops is compared via architectural level studies, analytical considerations and simulations. The analysis includes an implementation independent study on the effect of input sequences in the energy dissipation of single and double edge triggered flip-flops.

In this paper, the use of the neural networks as a tool for predicting the number of faults in programs is explored. Software complexity metrics have been shown to be closely related to the distribution of faults in program modules. The objective in the construction of models of software quality is to use measures that may be obtained relatively early in the software development life cycle to provide reasonable initial estimates of quality of an evolving software system. Measures of software quality and software complexity to be used in this modeling process exhibit systematic departures of normality assumptions of regression modeling. This paper introduces a new approach for static reliability modeling and compares its performance in the modeling of software reliability from software complexity in terms of the predictive quality and the quality of fit with more traditional regression modeling techniques. The neural networks did produce models with better quality of fit and predictive quality when applied to one data set obtained from a large commercial system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.1992.285855","pdfPath":"/iel2/434/7090/00285855.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"89","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings Third International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings Third International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.1992.285855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for predicting software development faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for predicting software development faults","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4478471","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for predicting software development faults","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00285855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040427S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","isNumber":"7090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"434","citationCount":"38","articleId":"285855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":285886,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Tang","affiliation":["Center for Reliable and High-Performance Computing, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Dong Tang","id":"37087260976"},{"name":"R.K.

Basic error characteristics are identified by statistical analysis. Correlations between software and hardware errors, and among software errors on different machines are investigated. Finally, reward analysis and reliability growth analysis are performed to evaluate software dependability. Results show that major software problems in the measured systems are from program flow control and I/O management. The network-related software is suspected to be a reliability bottleneck. It is shown that a multicomputer software 'time between error' distribution can be modeled by a 2-phase hyperexponential random variable: a lower error rate pattern which characterizes regular errors, and a higher error rate pattern which characterizes error bursts and concurrent errors on multiple machines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4493772","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the VAX/VMS error logs in multicomputer environments-a case study of software dependability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the VAX/VMS error logs in multicomputer environments-a case study of software dependability","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00285886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037328S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","isNumber":"7090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"434","citationCount":"17","articleId":"285886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":285887,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The methodology combines several techniques. Time series analysis is used to characterize the occurrence of software failures. Markov reward modeling is used to determine the loss in service due to failures of software components, and to identify major bottlenecks. The effectiveness of built-in fault tolerance is also evaluated. The methodology is illustrated using the software halt data from the Tandem GUARDIAN operating system. The results show that the occurrences of software halts are not correlated with each other in time.

It has been observed that, for such a problem, the values of the input weights are closely related to the input training set. An implication of this observation is that, rather than choosing initially random weights for the BPTA, one may choose initial weights that are actually quite close to an optimal solution. An advantage of such a choice is faster convergence time based on knowledge of the incoming training data. Decreasing convergence time makes more promising the use of the FFNN to classify ECGs for arrythmia detection, ambulatory monitoring and analysis, and front-line physician support instrumentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NEBC.1992.285919","startPage":"49","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the Eighteenth IEEE Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEBC.1992.285919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7091","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the Eighteenth IEEE Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/686/7091/00285919.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for decreasing neural network training time as applied to ECG classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/285919/","displayDocTitle":"A method for decreasing neural network training time as applied to ECG classification","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4589847","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-13 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for decreasing neural network training time as applied to ECG classification","confLoc":"Kingston, RI, USA","sourcePdf":"00285919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02849S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"7091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"686","articleId":"285919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":286004,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

An introduction to TPA is given, and the reasons for its use in the autocorrelator are explained with reference to nonlinear absorption experiments. We then describe the fabrication of the p-i-n GaAs/AlGaAs waveguide. The initial experiments carried out with a single beam in the waveguide are described and fitted to theory. Autocorrelation traces for both a CW modelocked Nd/sup 3+/:YAG laser at 1.06 /spl mu/m and a Q-switched InGaAsP/InP laser at 1.3 /spl mu/m are presented and their pulsewidths obtained by means of a theoretical model. The sensitivity and resolution of the TPA waveguide autocorrelator are then discussed, as is a proposal for a multiple-contact TPA waveguide autocorrelator, designed so that the two pulse trains are counter-propagating. This would result in an autocorrelator from which the laser pulsewidth could be obtained in a single measurement, with no moving parts, and which could be integrated with a semiconductor laser.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4717686","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The two-photon absorption semiconductor waveguide autocorrelator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The two-photon absorption semiconductor waveguide autocorrelator","sourcePdf":"00286177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037014S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"72","articleId":"286177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286178,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The noise is formulated in the scattering parameters, population inversion factor, and internal efficiency of the device. From this noise expression, a new equation for the amplified spontaneous emission spectral density from an optical amplifier is derived. This equation is more general than those previously published. The derivations are accomplished with the aid of methods from ordinary (classical) electrical network theory and only one quantum mechanical result regarding the noise from a conductance. As a result, the first-mentioned noise expression also includes the so-called vacuum field fluctuations. Further, the current noise spectrum of a square-law detector is derived with classical methods. The optical input to the detector includes the vacuum field fluctuations, which are shown to be the cause of the detector shot noise. Here, a second quantum mechanical result has to be employed, viz., that the vacuum field fluctuations cannot be detected alone. The results in this paper agree with the special cases found in the literature. The noise expressions are well suited for examination of the optical noise performance of arbitrary linear optical networks including, e.g., amplifiers, attenuators, isolators, reflections, filters, and couplers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.286178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.286178","startPage":"846","endPage":"853","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7117/00286178.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical quantum noise treated with classical electrical network theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optical quantum noise treated with classical electrical network theory","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4717687","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286178/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical quantum noise treated with classical electrical network theory","sourcePdf":"00286178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038069S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"27","articleId":"286178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":286187,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Techniques have also been emerging in recent years that offer enhanced quality in the neighborhood of 2.4 kb/s over traditional vocoder methods. Wideband audio compression is generally aimed at a quality that is nearly indistinguishable from consumer compact-disc audio. Subband and transform coding methods combined with sophisticated perceptual coding techniques dominate in this arena with nearly transparent quality achieved at bit rates in the neighborhood of 128 kb/s per channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"82","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4734857","displayDocTitle":"Advances in speech and audio compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in speech and audio compression","sourcePdf":"00286194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222468S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"144","articleId":"286194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":286196,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

As radiology departments become increasingly digital, the quantities of their imaging data are forcing consideration of compression in picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and evolving teleradiology systems. Significant compression is achievable only by lossy algorithms, which do not permit the exact recovery of the original image. This loss of information renders compression and other image processing algorithms controversial because of the potential loss of quality and consequent problems regarding liability, but the technology must be considered because the alternative is delay, damage, and loss in the communication and recall of the images. How does one decide if an image is good enough for a specific application, such as diagnosis, recall, archival, or educational use? The authors describe three approaches to the measurement of medical image quality: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), subjective rating, and diagnostic accuracy. They compare and contrast these measures in a particular application, consider in some depth recently developed methods for determining diagnostic accuracy of lossy compressed medical images and examine how good the easily obtainable distortion measures like SNR are at predicting the more expensive subjective and diagnostic ratings. The examples are of medical images compressed using predictive pruned tree-structured vector quantization, but the methods can be used for any digital image processing that produces images different from the original for evaluation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.286196","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"919","endPage":"932","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7118/00286196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.286196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating quality of compressed medical images: SNR, subjective rating, and diagnostic accuracy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Distortion measurement","Digital images","Image storage","Picture archiving and communication systems","Loss measurement","Particle measurements","Radiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","image coding","vector quantisation","radiology","PACS"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed medical images","distortion measures","SNR","subjective rating","diagnostic accuracy","digital image","radiology","picture archiving and communication systems","PACS","teleradiology systems","lossy algorithms","medical image quality","predictive pruned tree-structured vector quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating quality of compressed medical images: SNR, subjective rating, and diagnostic accuracy","volume":"82","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4734858","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286196/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating quality of compressed medical images: SNR, subjective rating, and diagnostic accuracy","sourcePdf":"00286196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070373S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"173","articleId":"286196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286214,"authors":[{"name":"B.P.

The method utilizes the near-field data to determine some equivalent magnetic current sources over a fictitious planar surface which encompasses the antenna. These currents are then used to find the far fields. The near-field measurement is carried out by terminating each dipole with 50 /spl Omega/ load impedances and measuring the complex voltages across the loads. An electric field integral equation (EFIE) is developed to relate the measured complex voltages to the equivalent magnetic currents. The mutual coupling between the array of probes and the test antenna modeled by magnetic dipoles is taken into account. The method of moments with Galerkin's type solution procedure is used to transform the integral equation into a matrix one. The matrix equation is solved with the conjugate gradient-fast Fourier transformation (CG-FFT) method exploiting the block Toeplitz structure of the matrix. Numerical results are presented for several antenna configurations to show the validity of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an array of dipole probes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.286223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7119/00286223.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.286223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286223/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","displayDocTitle":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an array of dipole probes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4708245","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an array of dipole probes","sourcePdf":"00286223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037584S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"7119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","articleId":"286223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":286247,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Instead of considering the state only at sampling instants, this paper introduces a function piece during the sampling period as the state and gives an infinite-dimensional model with such a state space. This gives the advantage that sampled data systems with built-in intersample behavior can be regarded as linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. As a result, the approach makes it possible to introduce such time-invariant concepts as transfer functions, poles, and zeros to the sampled data systems even with the presence of the intersample behavior. In particular, tracking problems can be studied in this setting in a simple and unified way, and ripples are completely characterized as a mismatch between the intersample reference signal and transmission zero directions. This leads to the internal model principle for sampled data systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4679401","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A function space approach to sampled data control systems and tracking problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A function space approach to sampled data control systems and tracking problems","sourcePdf":"00286247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03332S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"301","articleId":"286247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":286250,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A recursive design procedure introduces at each step new design parameters and incorporates them in a novel Lyapunov function. This function encompasses all the states of the adaptive system and forces them to converge to a manifold of smallest possible dimension. Only as many controller parameters are updated as there are unknown plant parameters, and the dynamic order of the resulting controllers is no higher (and in most cases is lower) than that of traditional adaptive schemes. A simulation comparison with a standard indirect linear scheme shows that the new nonlinear scheme significantly improves transient performance without an increase in control effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.286250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7120","startPage":"738","endPage":"752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7120/00286250.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear design of adaptive controllers for linear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear design of adaptive controllers for linear systems","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4679404","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear design of adaptive controllers for linear systems","sourcePdf":"00286250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024863S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"167","articleId":"286250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":286251,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

The actuator characteristics are required only to be contained in the graph of a suitably regular set-valued map. The terminology \"/spl lambda/-tracking\" is used in the following sense: for arbitrary prescribed /spl lambda/>0, an (adaptive) feedback strategy is sought which, for every reference signal of class R and every system (unknown to the controller) of class S, ensures that the tracking error is asymptotic to the interval /spl lsqb//spl minus//spl lambda/,/spl lambda//spl rsqb//spl sub/R. The instantaneous values of the reference signal and scaler output only are available for feedback. Adopting the space W/sup 1,/spl infin//(R) as the set R of admissible reference signals and under fairly weak assumptions on the nature of the system nonlinearities, one such (R, S)-universal adaptive feedback solution to this servomechanism problem is constructed.

The specific HDTV and ATV systems which have been proposed and, in most cases, built and tested in various ways, are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.286291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","startPage":"102","endPage":"121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/7121/00286291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.286291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission of all-digital advanced television: state of the art and future directions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HDTV","Error correction","FCC","Proposals","Quadrature amplitude modulation","TV broadcasting","Senior members","Europe","Modems","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high definition television","television broadcasting","direct broadcasting by satellite","encoding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-digital advanced television","high definition television","HDTV","ATV systems","United States","Europe","satellite broadcasting","terrestrial broadcasting","error control","modulation","equalization","coding","communication theory","information theory","USA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Transmission of all-digital advanced television: state of the art and future directions","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708273","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286291/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission of all-digital advanced television: state of the art and future directions","sourcePdf":"00286291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117615S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"25","articleId":"286291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":286299,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In particular, cache miss rates in multiprocessors do not show the sharp drop typical of uniprocessors when the size of the cache block increases. The resulting high cache miss rate is a cause of concern, since it can significantly limit the performance of multiprocessors. Some researchers have speculated that this effect is due to false sharing, the coherence transactions that result when different processors update different words of the same cache block in an interleaved fashion. While the analysis of six applications in the paper confirms that false sharing has a significant impact on the miss rate, the measurements also show that poor spatial locality among accesses to shared data has an even larger impact. To mitigate false sharing and to enhance spatial locality, we optimize the layout of shared data in cache blocks in a programmer-transparent manner. We show that this approach can reduce the number of misses on shared data by about 10% on average.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.286299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7122/00286299.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.286299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"False sharing and spatial locality in multiprocessor caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"False sharing and spatial locality in multiprocessor caches","volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4717603","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286299/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"False sharing and spatial locality in multiprocessor caches","sourcePdf":"00286299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053867S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"118","articleId":"286299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286300,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

Using the multi-billion reference traces of A. Borg et al. (1990), we apply both techniques to multi-megabyte caches, where sampling is most valuable. We evaluate whether either technique meets a 10% sampling goal: a method meets this goal if, at least 90% of the time, it estimates the trace's true misses per instruction with /spl les/10% relative error using /spl les/10% of the trace. Results for these traces and caches show that set sampling meets the 10% sampling goal, while time sampling does not. We also find that cold-start bias in time samples is most effectively reduced by the technique of D.A. Wood et al. (1991).

Our method is obtained by bringing two modifications to a conventional evaluation method. The main motivations behind the development of this method are: the possibilities offered by the implementation of defect tolerance, the existence of many yield models, which may predict different results in terms of optimum number of spares, and the fact that some models are very compute intensive. The modeling methods leading to several usual yield models are briefly presented. We also present results showing that our method is valid for a wide range of parameters.

This can result in designs in which-physically adjacent rows (and columns) are not logically adjacent. Even if physically adjacent rows (and columns) are logically adjacent, there are other issues that preclude the possibility of identical physical and logical addresses. State-of-the-art memory chips are designed with spare rows and spare columns for reconfiguration purposes. After a memory chip is reconfigured, physically adjacent cells may no longer have consecutive logical addresses. Test algorithms used at later stages for the detection of physical neighborhood pattern sensitive faults have to consider the fact that the address mapping of the memory chip is no longer available. We present test algorithms to detect 5-cell and 9-cell physical neighborhood pattern sensitive faults and arbitrary 3-coupling faults, even if the logical and physical addresses are different and the physical-to-logical address mapping is not available. These algorithms have test lengths of O(N[log/sub 3/N]/sup 4/) and O(N[log/sub 3/N]/sup 2/), respectively, for N-bit RAMs, and are especially suited for testing reconfigured DRAMs. They also detect other conventional faults such as stuck-at faults and decoder faults. These test algorithms are based on efficiently identifying all triplets of objects among a group of n objects. We formulated this triplet identification problem as a hypergraph coloring problem, and developed an efficient 3-coloring algorithm that colors the n vertices of a complete uniform hypergraph of rank 3 such that each edge of the hypergraph is trichromatically colored in at most [log/sub 3/n]/sup 2/ coloring steps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.286305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.286305","startPage":"725","endPage":"736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7122/00286305.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypergraph coloring and reconfigured RAM testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hypergraph coloring and reconfigured RAM testing","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4717609","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypergraph coloring and reconfigured RAM testing","sourcePdf":"00286305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042574S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","articleId":"286305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":286310,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Several methods of data representation are developed to study their effects on the trainability and generalization capabilities of the neural networks. The method of Karhonen-Loeve (KL) transform is used to extract energy dependent features and to reduce the dimensionality of the weight space of the original data set. To extract the shape-dependent features of the data, another data preprocessing method known as Zernike moments is also studied for its use in the detector/classifier system. The effects of different neural network paradigms, architectural variations, and selection of proper training data on detection and classification rates are studied. Simulation results for nylon and wood targets indicate superior performance when compared to conventional schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of buried dielectric anomalies using neural networks-further results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.286352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/7124/00286352.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.286352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of buried dielectric anomalies using neural networks-further results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4702972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of buried dielectric anomalies using neural networks-further results","sourcePdf":"00286352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092871S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"10","articleId":"286352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":286353,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

We recommend the use of adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation to realize the twin goals of maintaining diversity in the population and sustaining the, convergence capacity of the GA. In the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA), the probabilities of crossover and mutation, p/sub c/ and p/sub m/, are varied depending on the fitness values of the solutions. High-fitness solutions are 'protected', while solutions with subaverage fitnesses are totally disrupted. By using adaptively varying p/sub c/ and p/sub ,/ we also provide a solution to the problem of deciding the optimal values of p/sub c/ and p/sub m/, i.e., p/sub c/ and p/sub m/ need not be specified at all. The AGA is compared with previous approaches for adapting operator probabilities in genetic algorithms. The Schema theorem is derived for the AGA, and the working of the AGA is analyzed. We compare the performance of the AGA with that of the standard GA (SGA) in optimizing several nontrivial multimodal functions with varying degrees of complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.286385","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7125/00286385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.286385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"656","endPage":"667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms","volume":"24","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4713179","publicationDate":"April 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00286385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033592S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"991","articleId":"286385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":286389,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

Besides, the increasing demands of large TV screens have turned the problem of reducing visible line structures in a TV screen into an important issue. To lessen the visual affects of those artifacts, a technique known as an interlaced to progressive conversion (IPC) technique has been widely studied in various shapes. In the paper, the authors propose a new algorithm for interlaced to progressive conversion, referred to as a directional correlation dependent interpolation filtering (DIF) algorithm, which is composed of a correlation-dependent linear interpolation for a signal in the low horizontal frequency band and a line doubling method for a signal lying in the high horizontal frequency band. The DIF algorithm splits the horizontal frequency band of a given input 2D signal into two adjoint signals and applies two isolated interpolation schemes for the respective bands. In the algorithm, the authors develop a directional correlation dependent, interpolation technique depending on the spatial correlations between the spatially symmetric samples in the observation sliding window centered at the sample to be estimated. Computer simulations and the hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm to evaluate its performance are rigorously evaluated. The authors design a chip for luminance/chrominance interpolation with peaking process (YCIP) which has been tested with a real sequence of LDP images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for interlaced to progressive scan conversion based on directional correlations and its IC design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.286406","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/7126/00286406.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.286406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7126","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for interlaced to progressive scan conversion based on directional correlations and its IC design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4713233","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for interlaced to progressive scan conversion based on directional correlations and its IC design","sourcePdf":"00286406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03998S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"47","articleId":"286406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":286413,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Hyun Nam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, VLSI & CAD Laboratory, Yonsei University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Hyun Nam","id":"37346571900"},{"name":"Jong Seob Baek","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, VLSI & CAD Laboratory, Yonsei University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Seob Baek","id":"37288653000"},{"name":"Moon Key Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, VLSI & CAD Laboratory, Yonsei University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moon Key Lee","id":"37336248600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"286413","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286413","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion estimation","Computer architecture","Buffer storage","Parallel algorithms","Distortion measurement","Parallel processing","Teleconferencing","Adaptive arrays","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","motion estimation","teleconferencing","real-time systems","systolic arrays","digital signal processing chips","search problems","video signals","parameter estimation","videotelephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible VLSI architecture","full search motion estimation","video applications","real time processing","full-search block matching algorithm","motion vector","parallel algorithm","videoconferencing","partial sum results","candidate block distortions","cyclic storage buffer","distortion measure","one dimensional semisystolic array architecture design","parameterizable motion estimation processor","MEP","search ranges","tracking areas","pixel rates","serial data inputs","pin counts","parallel processing","modularity"]}],"abstract":"A VLSI architecture to achieve real time processing of a full-search block matching algorithm is described.

This proposed architecture has the following advantages, 1) it has a serial data inputs to save pin counts but performs parallel processing, 2) it is parameterizable to set the search range, so that it is adaptable to different video applications, 3) it is also possible to operate for any vertical reference block size and horizontal ones of the multiples of basic size N, 3) it can operate in real time for videoconferencing applications, 4) it has a degree of modularity suitable for VLSI implementation, and 5) it can be easily and cost-effectively implemented into VLSI by its simple structure mainly composed of one-dimensional array of processing elements (PEs) and by its low control overhead.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.286413","startPage":"176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/7126/00286413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.286413","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible VLSI architecture of full search motion estimation for video applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Flexible VLSI architecture of full search motion estimation for video applications","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4713240","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible VLSI architecture of full search motion estimation for video applications","sourcePdf":"00286413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05453S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"13","articleId":"286413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":286421,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In this environment, successful execution of programs is conditioned on the successful access of related files distributed throughout the system. The use of stochastic Petri nets is demonstrated by extending a basic reliability model to account for repair actions when faults occur. To this end, two possible models are discussed: the global repair model, which assumes a centralized repair team that restores the system to its original status when a failure state is reached, and the local repair model, which assumes that repairs are localized to the node where they occur. The former model is useful in evaluating the availability of programs (or the availability of the hardware support) subject to hardware faults that are repaired globally; therefore, the programs of interest can be interrupted. On the other hand, the latter model can be used to evaluate program reliability in the presence of hardware faults subject to repair, without interrupting the normal operation of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286421/","volume":"20","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4684450","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dependability modeling and analysis of distributed programs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependability modeling and analysis of distributed programs","sourcePdf":"00286421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048247S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"12","articleId":"286421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":286637,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Ocean-bottom modems initiate the transmission process by requesting data channel time slots via a common narrow-band request channel. Request packets overlap in time and frequency in this channel, and the throughput and average transmission delay rely heavily on the successful resolution of the request packet collisions. This paper presents the design, analysis, and experimental demonstration of a request channel receiver capable of resolving collisions between several asynchronous and cochannel packets. The receiver algorithm differs from standard capture schemes (by demodulating the data from both strong and weak transmitters), conventional spread-spectrum receivers (by overcoming the near-far problem), and existing multiple-access demodulation techniques (by adapting to the number of interfering signals, and the unknown phase, Doppler, amplitude, and timing of each signal in the collision). The receiver demodulates the collided packets by decision-directed techniques through a novel method of estimating the interference for each user which minimizes error propagation due to inaccurate tentative decisions. An inwater experiment illustrates that this technique is extremely desirable for collision resolution in underwater acoustic local area networks, and also for underwater autonomous vehicles with both sidescan sonar as well as acoustic telemetry links.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.286637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.286637","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7134/00286637.pdf","startPage":"158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multiuser detection for underwater acoustical channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286637/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multiuser detection for underwater acoustical channels","volume":"19","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4708471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multiuser detection for underwater acoustical channels","sourcePdf":"00286637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025898S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"28","articleId":"286637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":286639,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

The sizes of obstacles to be avoided range from the diameter of cables up to the size of other vehicles. A classical solution to this problem is the use of an obstacle avoidance sonar, but due to the high degree of sophistication of modern-day mines and unfriendly vehicles, it is desirable to avoid signal energies that might be detectable. The use of spread-spectrum signal structures is one possible way to avoid this difficulty while retaining the capability of despreading the energy at the receiver. This paper presents the development of a beamforming system that uses a frequency-decomposition FFT beamformer and a spread-spectrum signal structure for low-probability-of-detection navigation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.286639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7134","startPage":"175","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7134/00286639.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband, high-resolution, low-probability-of-detection FFT beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A wideband, high-resolution, low-probability-of-detection FFT beamformer","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4708473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband, high-resolution, low-probability-of-detection FFT beamformer","sourcePdf":"00286639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033877S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"12","articleId":"286639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":286640,"authors":[{"name":"Kiho Kim","affiliation":["Offshore Technology Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Kiho Kim","id":"37384441800"},{"name":"Sung Bae Kim","affiliation":["Offshore Technology Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Sung Bae Kim","id":"37366626400"},{"name":"E.J.

The extraction of representative features from the sidescan imagery is analyzed, and the performance of several commonly used texture measures are compared in terms of classification accuracy using a backpropagation neural network. A suite of experiments compares the effectiveness of different feature vectors, the selection of training patterns, the configuration of the neural network, and two widely used statistical methods: Fisher-pairwise classifier and nearest-mean algorithm with Mahalanobis distance measure. The feature vectors compared here comprise spectral estimates, gray-level run length, spatial gray-level dependence matrix, and gray-level differences. The overall accurate classification rates using the best feature set for the three seafloor types are: sediment ponds, 85.9%; ridge flanks, 91.2%; and valleys, 80.1%. While most current approaches are statistical, the significant finding in this study is that high performance for seafloor classification in terms of accuracy and computation can be achieved using a neural network with the proper combination of texture features. These are preliminary results of our program toward the automated segmentation and classification of undersea terrain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.286644","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286644.png","startPage":"214","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7134/00286644.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.286644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to classification of sidescan sonar imagery from a midocean ridge area","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Sediments","Sea floor","Sonar measurements","Testing","Data mining","Feature extraction","Image analysis","Image texture analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","backpropagation","feature extraction","seafloor phenomena","oceanographic techniques","acoustic imaging","sonar","image segmentation","geophysics computing","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sidescan sonar imagery","geoacoustic provinces","midocean-ridge spreading center","axial valley","ridge flank","sediment pond","texture measures","classification accuracy","backpropagation neural network","training patterns","statistical methods","Fisher-pairwise classifier","nearest-mean algorithm","Mahalanobis distance measure","feature vectors","spectral estimates","gray-level dependence matrix","seafloor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to classification of sidescan sonar imagery from a midocean ridge area","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708478","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to classification of sidescan sonar imagery from a midocean ridge area","sourcePdf":"00286644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048356S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"38","articleId":"286644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":286645,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

Digital signal processing, such as adaptive equalization, is known to greatly improve the communication data rate by limiting intersymbol interference (ISI). However, existing underwater acoustic equalization studies are limited to single-channel techniques, and spatial diversity processing is limited to selection or combining. In this paper, we design minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizers jointly among all spatial diversity channels. We call this spatial diversity equalization (SDE). Results are based on a very sparse vertical array in a midrange underwater acoustic channel. We study the effect of element number and placement, the length of the equalization filters, and linear feedforward versus nonlinear decision feedback algorithms. A suboptimum equalizer combiner (EC) is studied to alleviate the computational intensity of JCE. We first design the system for a known acoustic channel; later, some results are verified using adaptive algorithms. Results are presented both in terms of the mean-square error (MSE) and the probability of a symbol error. The latter is important as it is the ultimate interest for a digital communication system. We found that system performance improves rapidly with an increase in the number of spatial channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.286646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"227","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7134/00286646.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286646.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.286646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial diversity equalization applied to underwater communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater communication","Diversity reception","Underwater acoustics","Digital communication","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Multipath channels","Digital signal processing","Adaptive equalizers","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater sound","intersymbol interference","equalisers","probability","array signal processing","diversity reception","fading","computational complexity","filtering and prediction theory","digital communication systems","acoustic signal processing","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic digital communication","spatial diversity equalization","fading multipath channels","adaptive equalization","communication data rate","intersymbol interference","minimum mean-square error equalizers","sparse vertical array","midrange underwater acoustic channel","equalization filters","nonlinear decision feedback algorithms","linear feedforward feedback algorithms","suboptimum equalizer combiner","acoustic channel","adaptive algorithms","probability","system performance","ocean model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Spatial diversity equalization applied to underwater communications","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4708480","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286646/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial diversity equalization applied to underwater communications","sourcePdf":"00286646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030235S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"32","articleId":"286646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":286663,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

It has been suggested that CDMA be used as a multiple access method for satellite systems as well, in particular for multispot beam low Earth orbit satellites (LEOS). One is tempted to argue that since CDMA works well on terrestrial links, it will nominally work as well on satellite links. However, because there are fundamental differences in the characteristics of the two channels, such as larger time delays from the mobile to the base station and smaller multipath delay spreads on the satellite channels, the performance of CDMA on satellite links cannot always be accurately predicted from its performance on terrestrial channels. In the paper, the authors analytically derive the performance of a CDMA system which operates over a low Earth orbiting satellite channel. They incorporate such effects as imperfect power control and dual-order diversity to obtain the average probability of error of a single user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286663.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"567","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286663.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of DS-CDMA with imperfect power control operating over a low earth orbiting satellite link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of DS-CDMA with imperfect power control operating over a low earth orbiting satellite link","volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717195","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of DS-CDMA with imperfect power control operating over a low earth orbiting satellite link","sourcePdf":"00286663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050598S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"65","articleId":"286663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":286664,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Multiple access techniques presently under discussion are code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and hybrids of both. In the paper, a hybrid C/TDMA system using joint detection (JD-C/TDMA) with coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) at the base station (BS) receiver is proposed. Some attractive features of the JD-C/TDMA system are the possibility to flexibly offer voice and data services with different bit rates, soft capacity, inherent frequency and interferer diversity, and high system capacity due to JD. Furthermore, due to JD, a cluster size equal to 1 can be realized without needing soft handover. The single cell E/sub b//N/sub 0/ performance and the interference situation in a cellular environment of the uplink of a JD-C/TDMA mobile radio system with CRAD is investigated in detail. It is shown that the cellular spectrum efficiency is remarkably high, taking values up to 0.2 bit/s/Hz/BS in the uplink, depending on the actual transmission conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286664.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286664.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.286664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a cellular hybrid C/TDMA mobile radio system applying joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Land mobile radio","Multiaccess communication","Receivers","Interference","Bit rate","Receiving antennas","Frequency diversity","Bandwidth","GSM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","signal detection","diversity reception","mobile radio systems","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular hybrid CDMA/TDMA mobile radio system","joint detection","coherent receiver antenna diversity","mobile radio systems","multiple access technique","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","JD-C/TDMA","CRAD","base station receiver","voice services","data services","bit rates","soft capacity","frequency diversity","interferer diversity","system capacity","cluster size","performance","interference","uplink","cellular spectrum efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a cellular hybrid C/TDMA mobile radio system applying joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a cellular hybrid C/TDMA mobile radio system applying joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","sourcePdf":"00286664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056158S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"100","articleId":"286664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286665,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The multiuser maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) is derived, and an equivalence of the fading channel to an asynchronous Gaussian intersymbol interference (AGISI) CDMA channel is established. However, the MLSD is found to be implementationally infeasible and this motivates the derivation of the optimum linear detector with near/far resistance as the performance criterion. The optimally near/far resistant linear time-invariant K-user detector is shown to consist of a cascade of a 2 K input/K output linear multiuser diversity combining filter followed by a K input/K output decorrelator that is designed for the equivalent AGISI/CDMA channel. This detector solves the near/far problem and also supports significantly higher bandwidth efficiencies for CDMA communication over the fading channel than does the conventional near/far limited single-user diversity combiner. The performance penalties incurred by multiuser detectors designed for the Gaussian channel when used over the Rician fading channel are also analytically characterized. It is shown that these penalties can be significant, making the case for the use of multiuser detectors optimized for this fading channel, particularly the optimum linear detector due to its relative implementational simplicity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717197","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum diversity combiner based multiuser detection for time-dispersive Rician fading CDMA channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum diversity combiner based multiuser detection for time-dispersive Rician fading CDMA channels","sourcePdf":"00286665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054567S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","articleId":"286665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":286666,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the MFSK/FH-SSMA system, an address code is employed as a hopping sequence to hop the carrier frequency in MFSK. In the proposed scheme, it is assumed that the address codes of all users in MFSK/FH-SSMA are known. Then, candidates of the transmitted vector which are regenerated from the time-frequency matrices decoded by all the users' address codes are added with logical OR operation to produce candidates of the received matrix. The candidates of the received matrix are utilized in order to estimate a pattern of all users' data symbols which has the most number of coincident entries with the received matrix. Its BER (bit error rate) performance is evaluated by theoretical analysis and computer simulation in order to show the improvement of user capacity.

By a unified analysis, the probabilities of bit and packet errors in multipath fading environment for five time division (TDMA), code division, and time hopping (TH) related multiaccess networks are obtained; namely, TDMA, CDMA, CDMA/TDMA, Adaptive CDMA/TH, and variable frame CDMA/TDMA networks. The delay and useful throughputs of the five systems are also evaluated for data and voice traffic. All systems compared have the same channel power and bandwidth and support the same traffic. Though implementation issues are not covered, CDMA systems are put at a disadvantage (compared to cellular-type FDMA networks, for example) by ignoring such inherent advantages as voice silence utilizations and automatic frequency reuse. Nontheless, two CDMA systems outperform TDMA systems at low and medium input traffics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","startPage":"622","endPage":"637","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286669.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay and throughput characteristics of TH, CDMA, TDMA, and hybrid networks for multipath faded data transmission channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay and throughput characteristics of TH, CDMA, TDMA, and hybrid networks for multipath faded data transmission channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717201","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and throughput characteristics of TH, CDMA, TDMA, and hybrid networks for multipath faded data transmission channels","sourcePdf":"00286669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038092S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","articleId":"286669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286670,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhao Liu","id":"37346546100"},{"name":"M.

Residual capacity is introduced as the additional number of initial calls a base station can accept such that system-wide outage probability will be guaranteed to remain below a certain level. The residual capacity at each cell is updated dynamically according to the reverse-link SIR measurements at the base station. A 2/sup k/ factorial experimental design and analysis via computer simulations is used to study the impact of the parameters used in the algorithms. The influence of these parameters on system performance, namely blocking probability and outage probability, is then examined via simulation. The performance of the algorithms is compared together with that of a fixed call admission control scheme (fixed CAC) under both homogeneous and hot spot traffic loading. The results show that SIR-based CAC always outperforms fixed CAC even under overload situations, which is not the case in FDMA/TDMA cellular systems. The primary benefit of SIR-based CAC in DS-CDMA cellular systems, however, lies in improving the system performance under hot spot traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286670.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"644","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286670.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIR-based call admission control for DS-CDMA cellular systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"SIR-based call admission control for DS-CDMA cellular systems","volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4722131","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIR-based call admission control for DS-CDMA cellular systems","sourcePdf":"00286670.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057084S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"194","articleId":"286670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286671,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

The network performance is measured in terms of the average blocking probability of voice calls and the average delay and packet loss probability of data messages. The admission scheme determines the number of newly arrived voice users that are accepted in the network so that the long-term blocking probability of voice calls is minimized. In addition, new data arrivals are rejected if the mean delay or the packet loss probability of data exceeds a desirable prespecified level. A semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) is used to model the system operation. Then, a value iteration algorithm is used to derive the optimal admission control. Two models for the other-user interference of the CDMA system are considered: one based on thresholds and another based on the graceful degradation of the CDMA system performance, and their performance is compared. These admission policies find application in emerging commercial CDMA packet radio networks including cellular networks, personal communication networks, and networks of LEO satellites for global communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","startPage":"654","endPage":"664","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286672.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Admission policies for integrated voice and data traffic in CDMA packet radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Admission policies for integrated voice and data traffic in CDMA packet radio networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717203","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Admission policies for integrated voice and data traffic in CDMA packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"00286672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030617S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"89","articleId":"286672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":286673,"authors":[{"name":"K.

CLSP is an effective scheme to improve the throughput performance in spread unslotted Aloha systems. In spread slotted Aloha systems, however, it does not make sense to utilize CLSP because the slot size is usually the same as the packet size. The slot size of the proposed system is set less than the packet size, thereby enabling the authors to apply CLSP and improving the throughput performance. Another feature of the proposed system is that the system is not likely affected by the time difference between channel load sensing and timing of packet access, which they call the access timing delay.

To date, spread spectrum has been used mainly for military applications, in which the inherent transmission security and immunity to deliberate jamming are important. Spread spectrum systems, however, possess various other features such as multiple access and multipath rejection capability, which make their use attractive within the mobile radio environment. However, the current interest has been principally motivated by the work of Gilhousen et al. (see IEEE Trans. Vehic. Technol., vol.VT-40, no.2, p.303, 1991) in which it is claimed that the CDMA option may offer capacity improvement over more conventional frequency and time division multiple access, FDMA and TDMA, techniques. Within this paper, the relative capacities of a basic FDMA and CDMA system are examined. It is shown that, in the absence of capacity-enhancing features such as voice activity detection and cell sectorization, the capacity of each system is comparable. The paper then assesses the sensitivity of the CDMA system to typical propagation conditions, power control errors, and realistic antenna patterns and shows that the capacity of a CDMA system may be significantly reduced under nonideal conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of a spread spectrum CDMA system for cellular mobile radio with consideration of system imperfections","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.286674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286674.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"684","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286674.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286674/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of a spread spectrum CDMA system for cellular mobile radio with consideration of system imperfections","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717205","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of a spread spectrum CDMA system for cellular mobile radio with consideration of system imperfections","sourcePdf":"00286674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056849S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"66","articleId":"286674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":286675,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

It is assumed that the adaptive receiver has no knowledge of the signature waveforms and timing of other users. The receiver is trained by a known training sequence prior to data transmission and continuously adjusted by an adaptive algorithm during data transmission. The proposed linear receiver is as simple as a standard single-user detector receiver consisting of a matched filter with constant coefficients, but achieves essential advantages with respect to timing recovery, multiple access interference elimination, near/far effect, narrowband and frequency-selective fading interference suppression, and user privacy. An adaptive centralized decision feedback receiver has the same advantages of the linear receiver but, in addition, achieves a further improvement in multiple access interference cancellation at the expense of higher complexity. The proposed receiver structures are tested by simulation over a channel with multipath propagation, multiple access interference, narrowband interference, and additive white Gaussian noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Feedback","Timing","Data communication","Narrowband","Adaptive systems","Demodulation","Adaptive algorithm","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","radio receivers","adaptive systems","linear systems","feedback","demodulation","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","white noise","random noise","telecommunication channels","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback receiver","adaptive linear receiver","coherent demodulation","asynchronous code division multiple access","training sequence","data transmission","adaptive algorithm","matched filter","constant coefficients","timing recovery","near/far effect","frequency-selective fading","interference suppression","narrowband fading","user privacy","multiple access interference cancellation","simulation","multipath propagation channel","additive white Gaussian noise","narrowband interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286675","doi":"10.1109/49.286675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286675.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286675.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286675","startPage":"685","endPage":"697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive receiver structures for asynchronous CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive receiver structures for asynchronous CDMA systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717206","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive receiver structures for asynchronous CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00286675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056824S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"328","articleId":"286675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":286676,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It yields a potential increase in capacity over other access schemes, because it provides protection against interference, multipath, fading, and jamming. Recently, several interference cancellation schemes for CDMA have been proposed but they require information about all interfering active users or some channel parameters. The authors present an adaptive fractionally spaced decision feedback equalizer (DFE) for a CDMA system in an indoor wireless Rayleigh fading environment. This system only uses information about the desired user's spreading code and a training sequence. An analysis on the optimum performance of the DFE receiver shows the advantages of this system over others in terms of capacity improvements. A simulation of this system is also presented to study the convergence properties and implementation considerations of the DFE receiver. Effects on the performance because of sudden birth and death of users in the CDMA system and bit error rate performance of the DFE receiver is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286676.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"706","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286676.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision feedback equalization for CDMA in indoor wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286676/","displayDocTitle":"Decision feedback equalization for CDMA in indoor wireless communications","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717207","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision feedback equalization for CDMA in indoor wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00286676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053777S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"149","articleId":"286676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286677,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

A new compact expression for the SNR of the decision variable of a RAKE receiver is derived for generalized offset quadrature carrier modulation in this multipath environment. This expression also applies to BPSK, QPSK, and MSK modulation. The novelty of the derived expression is that it includes the effects of filtering. Filtering must be used to eliminate out-of band radiation and can also be used to shape the in-band spectrum, It is shown that bandlimiting filters have a significant effect on the SNR. A comparison of bandlimited O-QPSK and MSK reveals that, under the same co-user load, MSK has a lower SNR-0.917 times that of O-QPSK. However, MSK has an offsetting advantage of being a constant envelope-type modulation that can be very efficiently generated using direct modulation of a power RF oscillator. It is further shown that the O-QPSK SNR can be increased by a factor of 1.63 by whitening the in-band spectrum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of filtering on the performance of QPSK and MSK modulation in D-S spread spectrum systems using RAKE receivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.286677","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286677.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"715","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286677.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Effects of filtering on the performance of QPSK and MSK modulation in D-S spread spectrum systems using RAKE receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717208","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of filtering on the performance of QPSK and MSK modulation in D-S spread spectrum systems using RAKE receivers","sourcePdf":"00286677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044835S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","articleId":"286677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":286680,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the design study, a rigorous top down approach is adopted starting from the most essential objectives and requirements of universal third-generation mobile systems. Emphasis is laid on high flexibility with respect to the implementation of a wide range of services and service bit rates including variable rate and packet services. Flexibility in frequency and radio resource management, system and service deployment, and easy operation in mixed-cell and multioperator scenarios are further important design goals. The system concept under investigation is centered around an open and flexible radio interface architecture based on asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA with three different chip rates of approximately 1, 5, and 20 Mchip/s. The presented CDMA system concept forms the basis for an experimental test system (testbed) which is currently under development. This experimental system concept has been jointly established by the partners in the European RACE project R2020 (CODIT). The paper describes the radio transmission scheme and appropriate receiver principles and presents first performance results based on simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286680.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286680.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.286680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design study for a CDMA-based third-generation mobile radio system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Multiaccess communication","System testing","Frequency","3G mobile communication","Bit rate","Resource management","Telecommunications","Receivers","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","personal communication networks","packet switching","telecommunication services","radiotelephony","frequency allocation","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip rates","third-generation mobile radio system","personal communication systems","FPLMTS","UMTS","design study","top down approach","bit rates","variable rate services","packet services","radio resource management","frequency resource management","system deployment","service deployment","open radio interface architecture","asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA","testbed","experimental test system","European RACE project R2020","CODIT","radio transmission","receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design study for a CDMA-based third-generation mobile radio system","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4717211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design study for a CDMA-based third-generation mobile radio system","sourcePdf":"00286680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036909S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"268","articleId":"286680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286681,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

In order to achieve significant capacity, it has been shown that both transmit and receive notch filters should be used at the base station. This paper addresses whether the B-CDMA overlay concept can be applied to creating a CDMA microcell underlaying an existing analog macrocell. It is shown that indeed high capacity can be achieved in the microcell on both forward and reverse links, largely independently of the separation between microcell and macrocell bases. Furthermore, in the forward link the effect of neighboring base stations is shown to be negligible. In order to achieve maximum capacity, it is found that transmit and receive notch filters at the microcell base station are invaluable at small separations between micro and macrocells. It is also shown that key parameters which must be properly controlled are the powers of the CDMA base and mobile transmitters relative to their analog counterparts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.286681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.286681","endPage":"750","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286681.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7135/00286681.pdf","startPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity achievable with a broadband CDMA microcell underlay to an existing cellular macrosystem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286681/","displayDocTitle":"The capacity achievable with a broadband CDMA microcell underlay to an existing cellular macrosystem","volume":"12","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4717212","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity achievable with a broadband CDMA microcell underlay to an existing cellular macrosystem","sourcePdf":"00286681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028134S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","articleId":"286681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":286682,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

This result suggests that the n-MOSFET's are more error-sensitive than the p-MOSFET's for the reason that the n-MOSFET's have a higher efficiency of charge collection and a larger \"on\" current.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.286691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.286691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/7136/00286691.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"201","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00286691.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","displayDocTitle":"Identification of soft-error sensitive junction in SRAM's using a single ion microprobe","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4722533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of soft-error sensitive junction in SRAM's using a single ion microprobe","sourcePdf":"00286691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066652S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"8","articleId":"286691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":286810,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, model development is complicated by the fact that back-propagation neural networks contain several adjustable parameters whose optimal values are initially unknown. These include learning rate, initial weight range, momentum, and training tolerance, as well as the network architecture. The effect of these factors on network performance is investigated here by means of a D-optimal experiment. The goal is to determine how the factors impact network performance and to derive a set of parameters which optimize performance based on several criteria. The network responses optimized are learning capability, predictive capability, and training time. Learning and prediction accuracy are quantified by the experimental error of the model. The process modeled is polysilicon etching in a CCl/sub 4/-based plasma. Statistical analysis of the experimental results reveals that learning capability and convergence speed depend mostly on the learning parameters, whereas prediction is controlled primarily by the number of hidden layer neurons. An optimal network structure and parameter set has been determined which minimizes learning error, prediction error, and training time individually as well as collectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.286829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/7140/00286829.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.286829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal neural network process model for plasma etching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286829/","displayDocTitle":"An optimal neural network process model for plasma etching","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4704279","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal neural network process model for plasma etching","sourcePdf":"00286829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039371S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"82","articleId":"286829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":286831,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

An important issue in such multiring lamp systems is the optimal shaping of the output heat flux profile (HFP) of each ring to provide maximum controllability of the wafer temperature. In this paper we seek to optimize the ring HFP's via the lamp design parameters: ring positions and widths. We start by determining the heat loss profiles over the wafer surface for a variety of temperature setpoints and processing conditions. In order to maintain temperature uniformity across the wafer at a given setpoint, the lamp system should provide a compensating HFP. The total lamp HFP is the sum of the individual ring HFPs weighted by their respective applied powers. The HFP's are, in turn, functionally dependent on the lamp design parameters and this dependence can be measured through a calibration process. Therefore, the resulting optimization problem reduces to determining the lamp design parameters that result in lamp HFP's which best approximates the collection of the wafer heat loss profiles. Our method provides a practical technique for determining the optimal lamp design parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lamps","Rapid thermal processing","Temperature control","Design optimization","Design methodology","Process design","Controllability","Calibration","Fabrication","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lamps","optimisation","thermal analysis","temperature distribution","heat losses","semiconductor process modelling","rapid thermal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal lamp design","rapid thermal processing","multiring circularly symmetric lamp","multivariable control","power control","output heat flux profile","wafer temperature control","design parameters","ring positions","ring widths","heat loss profiles","temperature uniformity","optimization problem","wafer heat loss profiles","RTP modelling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/66.286831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/7140/00286831.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.286831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A contribution to optimal lamp design in rapid thermal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A contribution to optimal lamp design in rapid thermal processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286831/","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4704281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contribution to optimal lamp design in rapid thermal processing","sourcePdf":"00286831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03575S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"7140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"30","articleId":"286831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":286837,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We have prototyped and applied an integrated system, called DOE/Opt, for performing Design of Experiments (DOE), Response Surface Modeling (RSM), and Optimization (Opt). The system to be modeled and optimized can be either physical or simulation based. Within the DOE/Opt system, coupling to external simulation or experimental tools is achieved via an embedded extension language based on Tcl. The external problem then appears to DOE/Opt as a model with user defined inputs and outputs. DOE/Opt is used to generate splits for experiments, to dynamically build and evaluate regression models from experimental runs, and to perform nonlinear constrained optimizations using either regression models or embedded executions. The intermediate regression modeling can appreciably accelerate the optimization task when simulation or physical experiments are expensive. The primary application of DOE/Opt has been to process optimization using coupled process and device simulation. DOE/Opt has also been applied to process and device simulator tuning, and to aid in device characterization. Such a DOE/Opt system is expected to augment the use of TCAD tools and to utilize data collected by CIM systems in support of process synthesis. We have demonstrated the application of the system to process parameter determination, simulator tuning, process control modeling, and statistical process optimization.

The early form of this work has focused on hidden Markov models (HMM) that are independent of phonetic context. More recently, the theory has been extended to context-dependent models. The authors review the basic principles of their hybrid HMM/MLP approach and describe a series of improvements that are analogous to the system modifications instituted for the leading conventional HMM systems over the last few years. Some of these methods directly trade off computational complexity for reduced requirements of memory and memory bandwidth.

For illustration, in order to achieve a satisfactory control of a multijointed robotic manipulator during the execution of high speed trajectory tracking tasks, the highly nonlinear and coupled dynamics together with the variations in the parameters necessitate a fast updating of the control actions. For facilitating this requirement, a multilayer neural network structure that includes dynamical nodes in the hidden layer is proposed, and a supervised learning scheme that employs a simple distributed updating rule is used for the online identification and decentralized adaptive control.

The dynamics of these networks are analyzed. In particular, the dynamics of the canonical nonlinear programming circuit are analyzed. The circuit is shown to be a gradient system that seeks to minimize an unconstrained energy function that can be viewed as a penalty method approximation of the original problem. Next, the implementations that correspond to the dynamical canonical nonlinear programming circuit are examined. It is shown that the energy function that the system seeks to minimize is different than that of the canonical circuit, due to the saturation limits of op-amps in the circuit. It is also noted that this difference can cause the circuit to converge to a different state than the dynamical canonical circuit. To remedy this problem, a new circuit implementation is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.286888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7143/00286888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.286888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143","startPage":"931","endPage":"940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On solving constrained optimization problems with neural networks: a penalty method approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On solving constrained optimization problems with neural networks: a penalty method approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4662349","pubMedId":"18276523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On solving constrained optimization problems with neural networks: a penalty method approach","sourcePdf":"00286888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086673S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"7143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"86","articleId":"286888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286889,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.M.

For this purpose an efficient neural network shortest path algorithm that is an improved version of previously suggested Hopfield models is proposed.

The subsequent rate of convergence of the net error is very low. A modified technique for calculating a direction in weight-space which decreases the error for each class is presented.

Both the BPL and the PPL are based on projections of the data in directions determined from interconnection weights. However, unlike the use of fixed nonlinear activations (usually sigmoidal) for the hidden neurons in BPL, the PPL systematically approximates the unknown nonlinear activations. Moreover, the BPL estimates all the weights simultaneously at each iteration, while the PPL estimates the weights cyclically (neuron-by-neuron and layer-by-layer) at each iteration. Although the BPL and the PPL have comparable training speed when based on a Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm, the PPL proves more parsimonious in that the PPL requires a fewer hidden neurons to approximate the true function. To further improve the statistical performance of the PPL, an orthogonal polynomial approximation is used in place of the supersmoother method originally proposed for nonlinear activation approximation in the PPL.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.286906","startPage":"342","endPage":"353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7144/00286906.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.286906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression modeling in back-propagation and projection pursuit learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power line communications","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Learning systems","Backpropagation","Newton method","Least squares methods","Recursive estimation","Polynomials","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","optimisation","iterative methods","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regression modeling","backpropagation","projection pursuit learning","connectionist learning","interconnection weights","nonlinear activations","Gauss-Newton optimization","hidden neurons","orthogonal polynomial approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Regression modeling in back-propagation and projection pursuit learning","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4719286","pubMedId":"18267802","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression modeling in back-propagation and projection pursuit learning","sourcePdf":"00286906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076317S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"209","articleId":"286906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":286907,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the biological system inputs are picked up by an integrating nerve fiber, in the HW model by an RC network with compartmental threshold devices. The network state is read by a host PC through an array of threshold comparators. The output consists of pulse patterns that can be generated either by a simulation program or in the HW itself.

An efficient implementation scheme is also proposed, which is robust to distortions, insensitive to additive noise, and classifies the original image using adequate neural network architectures applied directly to 2D image representations.

The method is based on the iterative update of input vector toward a solution, while escaping from local minima. The input vector update is determined by the pseudo-inverse of the gradient of Lyapunov function, and, should an optimal solution be searched for, the projection of the gradient of a performance index on the null space of the gradient of Lyapunov function. The update rule is allowed to detect an input vector approaching local minima through a phenomenon called \"update explosion\". At or near local minima, the input vector is guided by an escape trajectory generated based on \"global information\", where global information is referred to here as predefined or known information on forward mapping; or the input vector is relocated to a new position based on the probability density function (PDF) constructed over the input vector space by Parzen estimate. The constructed PDF reflects the history of local minima detected during the search process, and represents the probability that a particular input vector can lead to a solution based on the update rule. The proposed method has a substantial advantage in computational complexity as well as convergence property over the conventional methods based on Jacobian pseudo-inverse or Jacobian transpose.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7144/00286912.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.286912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.286912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse mapping of continuous functions using local and global information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lyapunov method","Jacobian matrices","Nonhomogeneous media","Iterative methods","Performance analysis","Null space","Trajectory","Probability density function","History","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","probability","functional analysis","performance index","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse mapping","continuous functions","multilayer feedforward mapping network","input vector update","Lyapunov function","gradient projection","performance index","update rule","update explosion","local minima","forward mapping","probability density function","Parzen estimate","search process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Inverse mapping of continuous functions using local and global information","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719292","pubMedId":"18267808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse mapping of continuous functions using local and global information","sourcePdf":"00286912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041164S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"28","articleId":"286912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286914,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Due to the generality of the problem, conventional methods are difficult to apply. Thus, an approximate solution is sought by constraining control strategies to take on the structure of multilayer feedforward neural networks. After discussing the approximation properties of neural control strategies, a particular neural architecture is presented, which is based on what has been called the \"linear-structure preserving principle\". The original functional problem is then reduced to a nonlinear programming one, and backpropagation is applied to derive the optimal values of the synaptic weights. Recursive equations to compute the gradient components are presented, which generalize the classical adjoint system equations of N-stage optimal control theory. Simulation results related to nonlinear nonquadratic problems show the effectiveness of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4719294","pubMedId":"18267810","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for feedback feedforward nonlinear control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for feedback feedforward nonlinear control systems","sourcePdf":"00286914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053644S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"76","articleId":"286914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286915,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We show that a spatially decreasing neighborhood function is far more preferable than the usually rectangular neighborhood function, because of the weight quantization.

Due to the nonlinear modeling power of such networks, the learned mapping may interpolate all the training points. When erroneous training data are employed, the learned mapping can oscillate badly between data points. In this paper we derive a robust BP learning algorithm that is resistant to the noise effects and is capable of rejecting gross errors during the approximation process. The spirit of this algorithm comes from the pioneering work in robust statistics by Huber and Hampel. Our work is different from that of M-estimators in two aspects: 1) the shape of the objective function changes with the iteration time; and 2) the parametric form of the functional approximator is a nonlinear cascade of affine transformations. In contrast to the conventional BP algorithm, three advantages of the robust BP algorithm are: 1) it approximates an underlying mapping rather than interpolating training samples; 2) it is robust against gross errors; and 3) its rate of convergence is improved since the influence of incorrect samples is gracefully suppressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.286917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7144/00286917.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.286917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"467","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust backpropagation learning algorithm for function approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"A robust backpropagation learning algorithm for function approximation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286917/","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719297","pubMedId":"18267813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust backpropagation learning algorithm for function approximation","sourcePdf":"00286917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041638S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"227","articleId":"286917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":286921,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

The advantage of such weights is that the complexity of the hardware implementation of such networks is greatly reduced. If the task to be learned does not change over time, it may be sufficient to find the correct weights for a threshold function network off-line and to transfer these weights to the hardware implementation. This paper provides a mathematical foundation for training a network with standard logistic function nodes and gradually altering the function to allow a mapping to a threshold unit network. The procedure is analogous to taking the limit of the logistic function as the gain parameter goes to infinity. It is demonstrated that, if the error in a trained network is small, a small change in the gain parameter will cause a small change in the network error. The result is that a network that must be implemented with threshold functions can first be trained using a traditional back propagation network using gradient descent, and further trained with progressively steeper logistic functions. In theory, this process could require many repetitions. In simulations, however, the weights have be successfully mapped to a true threshold network after a modest number of slope changes. It is important to emphasize that this method is only applicable to situations for which off-line learning is appropriate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4719304","pubMedId":"18267820","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An iterative method for training multilayer networks with threshold functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative method for training multilayer networks with threshold functions","sourcePdf":"00286926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032395S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"32","articleId":"286926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":286927,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hoon Oh","affiliation":["Telecommun.

In this letter, we prove that the correlation coefficient between two jointly Gaussian random variables decreases when each of them is transformed under continuous nonlinear transformations, which can be approximated by piecewise linear functions. When the inputs or the weights of a multilayer perceptron are perturbed randomly, the weighted sums to the hidden neurons are asymptotically jointly Gaussian random variables. Since sigmoidal transformation can be approximated piecewise linearly, the correlations among the weighted sums decrease under sigmoidal transformations. Based on this result, we can say that sigmoidal transformation used as the transfer function of the multilayer perceptron reduces redundancy in the information contents of the hidden neurons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286927/","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719305","pubMedId":"18267821","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Effect of nonlinear transformations on correlation between weighted sums in multilayer perceptrons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of nonlinear transformations on correlation between weighted sums in multilayer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00286927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024846S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"15","articleId":"286927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":286928,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The authors apply an inverse problem formulation, presenting an integrated design to quadratic (l/sub 2/) and least absolute value (l/sub 1/) beamformers. The general solution of the l/sub 2/ beamformers is parameterized by a regularizing parameter that weights the confidence placed by the designer on prior knowledge versus the quality of the measurements. This regularizing parameter is used to establish an equivalence between alternative l/sub 2/ beamformers. The authors then develop time-recursive implementations of the l/sub 2/ and l/sub 1/ beamformers. The performance of these beamformers is studied next. The authors show that 1) in the presence of correlated arrivals, the MMSE beamformer uses constructively the correlation between incoming signals in reconstructing the estimated field, while rejecting the uncorrelated returns, and 2) the l/sub 1/ beamformer has the ability to adjust itself to unexpected noise conditions because it is considerably more robust than the l/sub 2/ beamformers to unmodeled impulsive noise or to the occurrence of malfunctioning sensors.

Such algorithms are a generalization of the least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm for even-symmetric error criteria. For this algorithm family, the authors derive general expressions for the mean and mean-square convergence of the filter coefficients For both arbitrary stochastic input data and Gaussian input data. They then provide methods for optimizing the nonlinearity to minimize the algorithm misadjustment for a given convergence rate. Using the calculus of variations, it is shown that the optimum nonlinearity to minimize misadjustment near convergence under slow adaptation conditions is independent of the statistics of the input data and can be expressed as -p'(x)/p(x), where p(x) is the probability density function of the uncorrelated plant noise. For faster adaptation under the white Gaussian input and noise assumptions, the nonlinearity is shown to be x/{1+/spl mu//spl lambda/x/sup 2///spl sigma//sub k//sup 2/}, where /spl lambda/ is the input signal power and /spl sigma//sub k//sup 2/ is the conditional error power. Thus, the optimum stochastic gradient error criterion for Gaussian noise is not mean-square. It is shown that the equations governing the convergence of the nonlinear algorithm are exactly those which describe the behavior of the optimum scalar data nonlinear adaptive algorithm for white Gaussian input.

This form of algorithm generalizes the so-called normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithm. They evaluate the expected behavior of this nonlinear algorithm for both independent input vectors and correlated Gaussian input vectors assuming the system identification model. By comparing the nonlinear algorithm's behavior with that of the LMS algorithm, they then provide a method of optimizing the form of the nonlinearity for the given input statistics. In the independent input case, they show that the optimum nonlinearity is a single-parameter version of the NLMS algorithm with an additional constant in the denominator and show that this algorithm achieves a lower excess mean-square error (MSE) than the LMS algorithm with an equivalent convergence rate. Additionally, they examine the optimum step size sequence for the optimum nonlinear algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm performs better and is less complex to implement than the optimum step size algorithm derived for another form of the NLMS algorithm. Simulations verify the theory and the predicted performance improvements of the optimum normalized data nonlinearity algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7145/00286952.pdf","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.286952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.286952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized data nonlinearities for LMS adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive filters","System identification","Convergence","Filtering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic systems","Optimization methods","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","stochastic processes","identification","convergence of numerical methods","vectors","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normalized data nonlinearities","LMS adaptation","LMS algorithms","stochastic gradient estimate","memoryless nonlinearities","system identification","scalar function","input data vector","normalized LMS algorithm","independent input vectors","correlated Gaussian input vectors","system identification model","input statistics","NLMS algorithm","mean-square error","MSE","convergence rate","optimum step size sequence","optimum nonlinear algorithm","simulations","adaptive filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Normalized data nonlinearities for LMS adaptation","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4724420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized data nonlinearities for LMS adaptation","sourcePdf":"00286952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047069S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"99","articleId":"286952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":286954,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ta-Sung Lee","id":"37277273300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"286954","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":971},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Array signal processing","Narrowband","Frequency","Direction of arrival estimation","Matrix decomposition","Sensor arrays","Position measurement","Covariance matrix","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","parameter estimation","matrix algebra","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient wideband source localization","beamforming invariance technique","wideband direction-of-arrival estimation","DOA","coherent signal subspace transformation","beamforming matrices","narrowband array manifold vector","reference frequency","spatial distribution","focused data correlation matrix","beamspace root-MUSIC algorithm","multiple wideband sources"]}],"abstract":"A novel scheme for wideband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is proposed.

Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the new scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.286954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7145/00286954.pdf","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.286954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient wideband source localization using beamforming invariance technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286954/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient wideband source localization using beamforming invariance technique","volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4724422","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient wideband source localization using beamforming invariance technique","sourcePdf":"00286954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033541S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","articleId":"286954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":286957,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

They may be used to enhance signals while nulling interferences. In the paper, the authors give several basic results for oblique projections, including formulas for constructing oblique projections with desired range and null space. They analyze the algebra and geometry of oblique projections in order to understand their properties. They then show how oblique projections can be used to separate signals from structured noise (such as impulse noise), damped or undamped interfering sinusoids (such as power line interference), and narrow-band noise. In some of the problems addressed, the oblique projection provides an alternative way to implement an already known solution. Expressing these solutions as oblique projections brings geometrical insight to the study of the solution. The geometry of oblique projections enables one to compute performance in terms of angles between signal and noise subspaces. As a special case of removing impulse noise, the authors can use oblique projections to interpolate missing data samples. In array processing, oblique projections can be used to simultaneously steer beams and nulls. In communications, oblique projections can be used to remove intersymbol interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.286957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7145/00286957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.286957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal processing applications of oblique projection operators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=286957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal processing applications of oblique projection operators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/286957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4724425","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal processing applications of oblique projection operators","sourcePdf":"00286957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036797S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"312","articleId":"286957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":286959,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

By restricting the class of adaptive weighting functions, the adaptively weighted Fourier transform data can be represented as the convolution of the unweighted Fourier transform with a data adaptive FIR filter where one selects the FIR filter coefficients to maximize signal-to-interference ratio. This adaptive sidelobe reduction (ASR) procedure is analogous to Capon's (1969) minimum variance method (MVM) of adaptive spectral estimation. Unlike MVM, which provides a statistical estimate of the real-valued power spectral density, thereby estimating noise level and improving resolution, ASR provides a single-realization complex-valued estimate of the Fourier transform that suppresses sidelobes and noise. Further, the computational complexity of ASR is dramatically lower than that of MVM, which is critical for large multidimensional problems such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation. ASR performance characteristics can be varied through the choice of filter order, l/sub 1/- or l/sub 2/-norm filter vector constraints and a separable or nonseparable multidimensional implementation. The author compares simulated point scattering SAR imagery produced by the ASR, MVM, and MUSIC algorithms and illustrates ASR performance on three sets of collected SAR imagery.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.287022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7147/00287022.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.287022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sidelobe reduction via adaptive FIR filtering in SAR imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=287022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287022/","displayDocTitle":"Sidelobe reduction via adaptive FIR filtering in SAR imagery","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719604","pubMedId":"18291927","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sidelobe reduction via adaptive FIR filtering in SAR imagery","sourcePdf":"00287022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04113S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"55","articleId":"287022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":287027,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

This model is called GLANN (genetic learning algorithm for neural networks). The components of GLANN can be shown to be biologically plausible.

Learning is stored in the form of newly created patterns, which can then be stored in some kind of associative memory. The benefits of GLANN reside in the proven optimizing capabilities of genetic algorithms, and in its parallel implementation. The shallow two-level architecture translates into system scalability, an issue that has not been successfully resolved in the case of other neural network algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287083","startPage":"835","endPage":"840 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287083.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm as the learning procedure for neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Biological system modeling","Biological information theory","Biological cells","Backpropagation algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Information processing","Biology computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","learning procedure","neural networks","GLANN","biologically plausible","reinforcement learning algorithm","binary strings","genetic operators","associative memory","parallel implementation","shallow two-level architecture","system scalability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm as the learning procedure for neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2006","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4417455","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm as the learning procedure for neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082065S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"287083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":287088,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The major disadvantage of a PNN stems from the fact that it requires one node or neuron for each training pattern. Various clustering techniques have been proposed to reduce this requirement to one node per cluster center. The correct choice of clustering technique will depend on the data distribution, data rate, and hardware implementation. Adaptation of kernel shape provides a tradeoff of increased accuracy for increased complexity and training time. The technique described also provides a basis for automatic feature selection and dimensionality reduction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287095/","accessionNumber":"4417443","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements to probabilistic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements to probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045606S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"71","articleId":"287095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":287098,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Chan Lee","affiliation":["College of Natural Science, Department of Computer Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Chan Lee","id":"37087454514"},{"name":"Yung Hwan Kim","affiliation":["College of Natural Science, Department of Computer Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yung Hwan Kim","id":"37087310686"},{"name":"Won Don Lee","affiliation":["College of Natural Science, Department of Computer Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won Don Lee","id":"37087274267"},{"name":"Suk Hoon Lee","affiliation":["College of Natural Science, Department of Computer Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suk Hoon Lee","id":"37087534086"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0559-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"287098","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Linear discriminant analysis","Pattern classification","Hypercubes","Neurons","Computer science","Statistics","Knowledge acquisition","Machine learning","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge acquisition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classifying neural nets","Fisher's linear discriminant function","n-class pattern classification","partitioning","network topology","ID3","knowledge acquisition tool","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=287098","abstract":"The network model for two-class pattern classification originally proposed by C.

Owing to a possible large number of connections, it has been expected that recurrent neural networks will converge faster. To activate hidden connections and use hidden units efficiently, a complexity term proposed by D.E. Rumelhart was added to the standard quadratic error function. A complexity term method is modified with a parameter to be normally effective for positive values, while negative values are pushed toward values with larger absolute values. Thus, some hidden connections are expected to be large enough to use hidden units and to speed up the learning.

The number of different connection patterns is a combinational problem which grows factorially as the number of artificial synapses in the network and the number of sensor elements increase. It is shown that a specialized genetic algorithm produces promising results for a simple application using these types of networks.

The main objective is to indicate how, based on theoretical results in nonlinear control theory, practically viable controllers can be designed using neural networks. Simulation results are included to complement the theoretical discussions. The controllability and stabilization of an unknown system have been considered. Though it is initiated using local rank conditions, the range of validity of the result is significantly larger. Controllability is a generic property of linear systems and hence it is a very reasonable assumption to make. The rank condition, which is invariant under feedback or coordinate transformation, can easily be checked. The system need not be brought to any special form to check whether it holds. This combination of simplicity and large range of validity should prove it to be a most useful and practical method for the purpose of stabilizing nonlinear systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287122","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"275","endPage":"280 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287122.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neural networks","Open loop systems","Control systems","Controllability","Control theory","Feedback control","Neurofeedback","Nonlinear systems","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control theory","controllability","feedback","neural nets","nonlinear systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","neural networks","stabilization","equilibrium point","nonlinear control theory","local rank conditions","linear systems","feedback","coordinate transformation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of nonlinear dynamical systems using neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287122/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4411903","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of nonlinear dynamical systems using neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034234S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"2","articleId":"287122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":287123,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The neural network gains precision through adaptive learning, and is then converted back into a set of fuzzy rules for ease of understanding.

The system produces bond ratings that closely match those of human experts, and has higher precision and better generalization than a simple three-layer neural network. The system also makes it easier to understand the neural system's reasoning by translating it into the fuzzy inference format.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287129","startPage":"239","endPage":"244 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287129.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initializing multilayer neural networks with fuzzy logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Fuzzy neural networks","Bonding","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy reasoning","Laboratories","Investments","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","expert systems","feedforward neural nets","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms","investment","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer neural networks","fuzzy logic","neuro-fuzzy system","structured neural network","expert knowledge","precision","adaptive learning","fuzzy rules","bond rating application","reasoning","fuzzy inference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Initializing multilayer neural networks with fuzzy logic","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4411897","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initializing multilayer neural networks with fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063828S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"11","articleId":"287129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":287135,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A novel learning algorithm compatible with analog VLSI was applied to the two-input parity problem. The algorithm combines dynamically evolving architecture with limited gradient-descent backpropagation for efficient and versatile supervised learning. To implement the learning algorithm in hardware, synapse circuits were paralleled for additional quantization levels. The hardware-in-the-loop learning system allocated 2-5 hidden neurons for parity problems. Also, a 7*7 assignment problem was mapped onto a cascaded 64-neuron fully connected feedback network.

The electrical circuit architecture is modeled after complex neurons in the vertebrate brain which have spatially extensive dendritic tree structures that support large numbers of synapses. The circuit is primarily analog and, as in the biological model system, is virtually immune to process variations and other factors which often plague more conventional circuits. The nonlinear circuit is sensitive to both temporal and spatial signal characteristics but does not make use of the conventional neural network concept of weights, and as such does not use multipliers, adders, or other complex computational devices. As in biological neuronal circuits, a high degree of local connectivity is required. However, unlike biology, multiplexing of connections is done to reduce the number of conductors to a reasonable level for standard packages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287143","startPage":"154","endPage":"159 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287143.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon implementation of an artificial dendritic tree","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Biological system modeling","Classification tree analysis","Signal processing","Brain modeling","Neurons","Tree data structures","Immune system","Nonlinear circuits","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","neural chips","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuit","connections multiplexing","process variation immunity","pin out reduction","signal classification","silicon","artificial passive dendritic tree","dynamic signals","electrical circuit architecture","complex neurons","vertebrate brain","synapses","nonlinear circuit","neural network","local connectivity","multiplexing of connections","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Silicon implementation of an artificial dendritic tree","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4411883","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon implementation of an artificial dendritic tree","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044927S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"8","articleId":"287143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":287145,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Valiant's (1984) PAC (probably approximately correct) learning framework is extended to be applicable to the statistical decision theoretic problem setting. In this general setting, successful learning means finding a hypothesis or a decision rule that attains risk that is as close as possible to Bayes optimal risk. It is then shown that the generalization ability of a learning model in the extended PAC framework can be consistently considered from the Bayes risk consistency viewpoint. Finally, as an application of the extended PAC framework, an upper bound on the sample complexity of a neural network model is obtained. The upper bound is equal in the order of the PAC learning parameters epsilon and delta to the one that D. Haussler obtained (1989). However, the lower bound on sample complexity and the tightness of these upper bounds are remaining problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287145/","accessionNumber":"4407562","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An estimation of sample complexity of the neural network model in the extended PAC learning framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An estimation of sample complexity of the neural network model in the extended PAC learning framework","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038681S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"287145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":287147,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

Use of the proposed concepts results in improved system performance, reduced network dimension, less computational load, and improved learning for the examples considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287176","startPage":"413","endPage":"418 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287176.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric neural networks and its examples","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Network topology","Mechanical engineering","Pattern recognition","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric neural networks","symmetric weight distribution","weight distribution pattern","training algorithm","system performance","network dimension","computational load","learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric neural networks and its examples","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4407531","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric neural networks and its examples","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048019S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"287176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":287177,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Image Process and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yan Yan","id":"37087682320"},{"name":"Jie Gu Li","affiliation":["Institute of Image Process and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jie Gu Li","id":"37087563223"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0559-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"287177","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Neural networks","Prototypes","Brain modeling","Nervous system","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Circuits","Power system modeling","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","Hopfield neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time complexity","generalized neural network","qualitative behavior","isolated prototypes","asymptotically stable fixpoints","space complexity","Hopfield-like models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=287177","abstract":"An FTTB (from top to bottom) design strategy for a neural network is introduced.

The authors show the precise form of expected output for two- and three-input neurons, and describe these functions in the limit for a large number of inputs. They address a fundamental limitation inherent in these stochastic techniques: their finite precision. The precision is dependent upon the pulse averaging period-the longer this period (i.e. the larger the number of pulses sampled), the higher the precision. The authors derived exact expressions for the distribution of neural periods as well as a statistical analysis to find the averaging period required for precision of five bits-a resolution determined by others to be necessary for successful implementations of backpropagation. It is found that approximately=1000 pulses are required for 5-b precision.

The DRNN captures the dynamic nature of a system and, since it is not fully connected, training is much faster than with a fully connected recurrent neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287192","startPage":"315","endPage":"320 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287192.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for nonlinear system control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287192/","displayDocTitle":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for nonlinear system control","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4407515","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for nonlinear system control","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044108S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"7","articleId":"287192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":287197,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

These translation strategies were implemented in an automatic translation prototype, which was successfully applied to a number of expert system applications. A large majority of each expert system was translated; the untranslatable portions were nonetheless parallelized. The translator produced a highly parallel network, effectively examining all objects and most rules in parallel, and capable of running up to five orders of magnitude faster on existing neural hardware than on a 386 machine. The benefit of the translation process is that it most effectively combines the benefits of neural networks and expert systems, producing systems that are easy to design and understand because of their expert system origin and that are adaptable, fault tolerant, and parallel because of their neural network implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287197","startPage":"13","endPage":"20 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.287197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/7149/00287197.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic translation from an expert system to a neural network representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287197/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic translation from an expert system to a neural network representation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4441521","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic translation from an expert system to a neural network representation","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00287197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039075S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"7149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","articleId":"287197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":287211,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This lower bound is almost tight as one can compute the parity function with O(dn/sup 1/d/) sigmoidal units in a depth-(d+1) network. The techniques also generalize to networks whose elements can be approximated by piecewise low degree rational functions.

Along these lines, two neural structures are considered, one feedforward and one recurrent, whose objective is binary hypothesis testing. The first, FFS1, is a tandem feedforward structure, whereas the second, FFS2, is recurrent and involves cumulative forward feedback. Both parametric and robust designs for the two structures are considered and analyzed in terms of induced false alarm and power probabilities, and the inferiority of the FFS1 is rigorously proven in terms of the rate with which the induced power probability increases with the number of the neural elements. Asymptotic results are presented, as well as numerical results, with emphasis on the Gaussian and location parameter nominal hypotheses model, that exhibit the superiority of the robust designs clearly.

The topologies use a minimal number of devices and feature buck-boost voltage regulation capability without a transformer, while preserving a neutral connection which is common with the input AC line. The simplest form of the converter is seen to be an AC voltage regulator with output voltage range of 0-2 p.u. with reasonable line current waveform. Modifications allow the circuit to operate with fully controlled input current. The circuit can be further extended to provide significant ride-through capability without using a battery. Finally, a full function single phase UPS can also be realized if required.

An inference problem exists if it is possible for a user with a low-level clearance to draw conclusions about information at higher classifications. The authors are developing DISSECT, a tool for analyzing multilevel relational database schemas to assist in the detection and elimination of inference problems. A translation is defined from schemas to an equivalent graph representation, which can be presented graphically in DISSECT. The initial focus is on detection of inference problems that depend only on information all of which is stored in the database. In particular, potential inference problems are identified as different sequences of foreign key relationships that connect the same entities. Inferences can be blocked by upgrading the security classification of some of foreign key relationships. A global optimization approach to upgrading is suggested to block a set of inference problems that allows upgrade costs to be considered, and supports security categories as well as levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1993.287632","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/902/7168/00287632.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1993.287632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and elimination of inference channels in multilevel relational database systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Detection and elimination of inference channels in multilevel relational database systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4677283","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and elimination of inference channels in multilevel relational database systems","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00287632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047084S","chronDate":"24-26 May 1993","isNumber":"7168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"902","citationCount":"23","articleId":"287632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":287638,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Since the desired control action is usually unknown, the output error of the ANN controller is also unknown. A simple on-line training algorithm, which enables the neural network to be trained with the actual output error of the controlled drive plant is used. The direction of the controlled plant output response is the only a priori knowledge needed. The ANN based controller is effective, robust, and results in high performance permanent magnet DC motor drives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Permanent magnets","Artificial neural networks","DC motors","Error correction","Algorithm design and analysis","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","DC motors","electric drives","machine control","neural nets","adaptive control","velocity control","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network speed controller","permanent magnet DC motor drives","artificial neural network","output error vector","on-line training algorithm","controlled plant output response"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1994.287841","startPage":"416","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/940/7171/00287841.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1994.287841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive neural network speed controller for permanent magnet DC motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural network speed controller for permanent magnet DC motor drives","accessionNumber":"4664869","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural network speed controller for permanent magnet DC motor drives","confLoc":"Athens, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00287841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031942S","chronDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"940","citationCount":"1","articleId":"287841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":287872,"authors":[{"name":"V.C.

Higher frequency components are extracted using finer time resolution, and lower frequency components are extracted using coarser time resolution. The transform decomposes a scanned signal into localized contributions for multiscale analysis. The authors present a general multiprocessor architecture for the efficient computation of signal decomposition with general wavelet bases. Their discrete wavelet transform (DWT) architecture is composed of a linear array of commercially available processors, which is easily reconfigurable for variable sized windows of data to be transformed. The use of commercially available processors replaces the costly special-purpose VLSI chip, and can be reprogrammed for other digital signal processing applications. Combining the filtering and decimation processes in the decomposition stage via a block state-space formulation achieves an efficient real-time implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel implementation of the discrete wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1994.287872","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/940/7171/00287872.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1994.287872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=287872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"A parallel implementation of the discrete wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4664838","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel implementation of the discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Athens, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00287872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067494S","chronDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"940","citationCount":"5","articleId":"287872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":287885,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

For time varying processes, conventional neural networks which are trained off-line cannot accurately predict process outputs over time. Hence, it is important to introduce recent process data to the network and update their weights as soon as new data is received. In this paper we introduce an algorithm to train the neural network model recursively. A controller is developed using a mathematical model and is employed as a nonlinear controller. The resulting architecture controls the process extremely well in the region of interest and has ability to learn continuously from new incoming data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1994.287886","pdfPath":"/iel2/940/7171/00287886.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 26th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1994.287886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process control of nonlinear time variant processes via artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/287886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Process control of nonlinear time variant processes via artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4664824","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process control of nonlinear time variant processes via artificial neural network","confLoc":"Athens, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00287886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068795S","chronDate":"20-22 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"940","citationCount":"2","articleId":"287886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":287896,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

In contrast, even in a noiseless situation, all other coding methods result in undesirable sidelobes. For a given number of chips, a variety of complementary code sets can be formed; this is a result of manipulating the number of subsequences and the number of chips in each subsequence. There are, however, no published results to judge the relative resolution performance of such code sets due to the errors introduced by quadrature sampling. The results provided in the present paper highlight the effect of quadrature sampling errors on the resolution properties of a variety of complementary coded waveforms.

In a sectored cache, a single address tag is associated with a sector consisting on several cache lines, while validity, dirty and coherency tags are associated with each of the inner cache lines. Usually in a cache, a cache line location is statically linked to one and only one address tag word location. In the decoupled sectored cache introduced in the paper, this monolithic association is broken; the address tag location associated with a cache line location is dynamically chosen at fetch time among several possible locations. The tag volume on a decoupled sectored cache is in the same range as the tag volume in a traditional sectored cache; but the hit ratio on a decoupled sectored cache is very close to the hit ratio on a non-sectored cache. A decoupled sectored cache will allow the same level of performance as a non-sectored cache, but at a significantly lower hardware cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/950/7173/00288133.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1994.288133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1994.288133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled sectored caches: conciliating low tag implementation cost and low miss ratio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technical Activities Guide -TAG","Costs","Microprocessors","Hardware","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","memory architecture","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sectored caches","low tag implementation cost","low miss ratio","address tag","address tag location","hit ratio","performance","decoupled sectored cache"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled sectored caches: conciliating low tag implementation cost and low miss ratio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682160","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled sectored caches: conciliating low tag implementation cost and low miss ratio","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00288133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026848S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"950","citationCount":"47","articleId":"288133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":288140,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Prefetching can be either hardware-based or software-directed or a combination of both. Hardware-based prefetching, requiring some support unit connected to the cache, can dynamically handle prefetches at run-time without compiler intervention. Software-directed approaches rely on compiler technology to insert explicit prefetch instructions. Mowry et al.'s software scheme (1991,1992) and the authors' hardware approach (1991) are two representative schemes. In this paper, the authors evaluate approximations to these two schemes in the context of a shared-memory multiprocessor environment. Their qualitative comparisons indicate that both schemes are able to reduce cache misses in the domain of linear array references. When complex data access patterns are considered, the software approach has compile-time information to perform sophisticated prefetching whereas the hardware scheme has the advantage of manipulating dynamic information. The performance results from an instruction-level simulation of four benchmarks confirm these observations. Simulations show that the hardware scheme introduces more memory traffic into the network and that the software scheme introduces a non-negligible instruction execution overhead.

Many papers have addressed this problem using static disambiguation. These methods work extremely well when the memory access pattern is linear and predictable. However they are ineffective when the memory access pattern is nonlinear or when the access pattern cannot be determined statically. For these difficult problems, the authors present speculative disambiguation, a compilation technique for architectures supporting instruction level parallelism and either speculative execution or conditional execution (or both). This technique produces specialized code at compile time to disambiguate memory references at run time. It is shown that on machines with sufficient resources, the technique will always result in lower execution time. Speculative disambiguation has been implemented for a VLIW architecture with guarded execution. Preliminary results indicate that it can help bridge a significant fraction of the performance gap between a good and a perfect static disambiguator. Occasionally it can outperform the perfect static disambiguator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1994.288149","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","startPage":"200","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1994.288149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173","pdfPath":"/iel2/950/7173/00288149.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic compiler","VLIW","Registers","Out of order","Writing","North America","Ear","Parallel processing","Microprocessors","IEEE news"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program compilers","memory architecture","file organisation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compilation technique","dynamic memory disambiguation","speculative disambiguation","performance bottlenecks","memory access pattern","instruction level parallelism","speculative execution","conditional execution","performance gap","VLIW architecture","guarded execution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speculative disambiguation: a compilation technique for dynamic memory disambiguation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288149/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4682144","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speculative disambiguation: a compilation technique for dynamic memory disambiguation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00288149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046789S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"950","citationCount":"20","articleId":"288149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":288154,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Blumrich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Blumrich","id":"37353961300"},{"name":"Kai Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Kai Li","id":"37277619300"},{"name":"R.

First, the authors assess the utility of guarded execution, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using a variety of application programs. The assessment shows that guarded execution significantly increases the opportunities, for both compiler and dynamic hardware, to extract and exploit parallelism. However, existing methods of specifying guarded execution have several drawbacks that limit its use. Second, the authors study the interaction of guarded execution and dynamic branch prediction and show that the use of guarded execution significantly increases the number of instructions between mispredicted branches. Third, they propose a new method of specifying guarded execution. The proposed method uses special GUARD instructions, which can be used to incorporate guarded execution into existing instruction sets. GUARD instructions realize the full power of guarded execution, without the drawbacks of existing methods of specifying guarded execution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1994.288156","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/950/7173/00288156.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1994.288156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guarded execution and branch prediction in dynamic ILP processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288156/","displayDocTitle":"Guarded execution and branch prediction in dynamic ILP processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682137","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guarded execution and branch prediction in dynamic ILP processors","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00288156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076062S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"950","citationCount":"38","articleId":"288156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":288163,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

The area and access time of each level of cache is modeled in detail. The results indicate that for most workloads, two-level cache configurations (with a set-associative second level) perform marginally better than single-level cache configurations that require the same chip area once the first-level cache sizes are 64 KB or larger. Two-level configurations become even more important in systems with no off-chip cache and in systems in which the memory cells in the first-level caches are multiported and hence larger than those in the second-level cache. Finally, a new replacement policy called two-level exclusive caching is introduced. Two-level exclusive caching improves the performance of two-level caching organizations by increasing the effective associativity and capacity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1994.288163","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/950/7173/00288163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1994.288163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173","startPage":"34","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoffs in two-level on-chip caching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoffs in two-level on-chip caching","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288163/","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682130","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoffs in two-level on-chip caching","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00288163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025942S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"950","citationCount":"66","articleId":"288163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":288164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The conventional high-performance memory system provides fast data access via a large secondary cache. But large secondary caches can be expensive, particularly in large-scale parallel systems with many processors (and thus many caches). The authors evaluate a memory system design that can be both cost-effective as well as provide better performance, particularly for scientific workloads: a single level of (on-chip) cache backed up only by Jouppi's stream buffers and a main memory. This memory system requires very little hardware compared to a large secondary cache and doesn't require modifications to commodity processors. The authors use trace-driven simulation of fifteen scientific applications from the NAS and PERFECT suites in their evaluation. They present two techniques to enhance the effectiveness of Jouppi's original stream buffers: filtering schemes to reduce their memory bandwidth requirement and a scheme that enables stream buffers to prefetch data being accessed in large strides. The results show that, for the majority of the benchmarks, stream buffers can attain hit rates that are comparable to typical hit rates of secondary caches. Also, the authors find that as the data-set size of the scientific workload increases the performance of streams typically improves relative to secondary cache performance, showing that streams are more scalable to large data-set sizes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1994.288164","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 21 International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel2/950/7173/00288164.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1994.288164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating stream buffers as a secondary cache replacement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288164/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating stream buffers as a secondary cache replacement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1994","accessionNumber":"4682129","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating stream buffers as a secondary cache replacement","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00288164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022426S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"950","citationCount":"117","articleId":"288164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":288213,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The DART multiprocessor uses prioritized data-driven scheduling to ensure that multiple hard and soft deadlines are met. A data-driven checkpointing scheme has been developed that ensures that these deadlines are met even in the case of processor failures. The basic approach is to monitor the behavior of each computational thread by means of hardware timers. The results of a thread are released only if the thread completes before its given timeout period expires. Otherwise the partial computation on that processor is discarded and the thread is rescheduled on a different processor. A strategy to statically predict the system performance in the event of multiple processor failures is presented and evaluated. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the fault detection and recovery response times for single processor failures on DART multiprocessor architectures with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 processing elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1994.288217","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/958/7174/00288217.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"774","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1994.288217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection and recovery in a data-driven real-time multiprocessor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection and recovery in a data-driven real-time multiprocessor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4695903","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288217/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection and recovery in a data-driven real-time multiprocessor","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00288217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036718S","chronDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"958","citationCount":"1","articleId":"288217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":288255,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such domain decomposition of the FE graph is accomplished by creating an element interaction graph (EIG) and partitioning the EIG into sub-graphs using the Kernighan-Lin partitioning heuristic.

Previously, (Dowd et al., 1989) introduced the balanced merging network, with N=2/sup k/ inputs/outputs and log N stages of comparators. Using an intricate proof, they showed that a cascade of log N such blocks constitutes a sorting network. We have introduced a class of merging networks with N=2/sup k/ inputs/outputs and with periodic property (R. Becker et al., 1993). In this paper we extend our class of merging networks to arbitrary size N. For each N, the class contains an exponentially large number of merging networks (about 2/sup N/2/spl minus/1/) with /spl lsqb/log N/spl rsqb/ stages. The balanced merger is one network in this class. Other networks use fewer comparators. A cascade of /spl lsqb/log N/spl rsqb/ copies of a merging network in this class yields a periodic sorter. We provide a very simple and elegant proof of correctness based on the recursive structure of the networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/958/7174/00288267.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1994.288267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1994.288267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The generalized class of g-chain periodic sorting networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Merging","Corporate acquisitions","Computational Intelligence Society","Routing","Mathematics","Cities and towns","Africa","Hardware","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting","merging","trees (mathematics)","algorithm theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized class","g-chain periodic sorting networks","periodic sorter","balanced merging network","comparators","merging networks","periodic property","balanced merger","recursive structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"The generalized class of g-chain periodic sorting networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4695853","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The generalized class of g-chain periodic sorting networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00288267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057351S","chronDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"958","citationCount":"1","articleId":"288267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":288280,"authors":[{"name":"J.

While several articles have addressed software pipelining of single (non-nested) loops, little work has been done in the area of applying it to nested loops. The article solves the problem of finding the minimum iteration initiation interval (in the absence of resource constraints) for each level of a nested loop. The problem is formulated as one of finding a rational quasi-affine schedule for each statement in the body of a perfectly nested loop which is then solved using linear programming. This allows us to treat iteration-dependent statement reordering and multidimensional loop unrolling in the same framework. Unlike most work in scheduling nested loops, we treat each statement in the body as a unit of scheduling. Thus, the schedules derived allow for instances of statements from different iterations to be scheduled at the same time. Optimal schedules derived here subsume extant work on software pipelining of non-nested loops, in the absence of resource constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal software pipelining of nested loops","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1994.288280","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/958/7174/00288280.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1994.288280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=288280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal software pipelining of nested loops","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4695840","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal software pipelining of nested loops","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00288280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052324S","chronDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"958","citationCount":"16","articleId":"288280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":288292,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

Such an approach may thus achieve a speedup that is approximately linear in the number of processors. Furthermore, since no interacting moves can occur in our strategy, it is obvious that our scheme is free of errors in cost evaluation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1994.288292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1994.288292","startPage":"253","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/958/7174/00288292.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On random sampling for parallel simulated annealing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"On random sampling for parallel simulated annealing","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4695828","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/288292/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On random sampling for parallel simulated annealing","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00288292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038147S","chronDate":"26-29 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"958","citationCount":"1","articleId":"288292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":289099,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.M.

In particular, the analysis confirms wide tolerances on system timing and demonstrates that self-calibration can compensate for the effects of large variation in detector capacitance.

Each label for a particular object indicates one possible interpretation for that object. The CSNN can be viewed as a collection of neurons that interconnect with each other. The connections and the topology of a CSNN are used to represent the constraints in a CSP. The mechanism of the neural network is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints in order to achieve a global consistency. The final solution outlines segmented areas and simultaneously satisfies all the constraints.

The algorithms have been tested on an IBM 3090-600S supercomputer. The iterative EM reconstruction algorithm is 50 times longer with geometric response and photon attenuation models than without modeling these physical effects. An improvement in image quality in the reconstruction of projection data collected from a single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging system has been observed. Significant improvements in image quality are obtained when the geometric point response and attenuation are appropriately compensated. It is observed that resolution is significantly improved with attenuation correction alone. Using phantom experiments, it is observed that the modeling of the spatial system response imposes a smoothing without loss of resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289376/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3948703","publicationDate":"April 1991","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional iterative reconstruction algorithms with attenuation and geometric point response correction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional iterative reconstruction algorithms with attenuation and geometric point response correction","sourcePdf":"00289376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044586S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"7192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"210","articleId":"289376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":289380,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The Monte Carlo simulation was verified using measured tomograph data. The single-scatter analytical simulation was extended to estimate multiple scattering. The multiple-scatter analytical simulation showed good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation of total object scatter. It is shown using the analytical simulation that the position of a source along the line of response and the shape of the scattering object make a substantial difference in the scatter distribution in the projections. Such projections can be generated in a much shorter time using the analytical simulation than using the Monte Carlo simulation.

Simulations show that dividing the crystal into two equiprobable regions of interaction almost eliminates this blurring. This has been done using a black band placed around a 3-cm bismuth germanate crystal, 1 cm from the front. A photomultiplier tube (PMT) collects light from the rear of the crystal for energy and timing measurement. Another PMT collects light through a light guide from the top front of the crystal to find the depth of interaction. Gamma rays interacting in the front of the crystal produce a strong signal in the depth-sensing PMT, while interactions behind the band produce a weaker (<10%) signal. The intensity of the light recorded by the energy PMT is almost constant (within +or-3%) for interactions at any depth in the crystal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.289382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7192/00289382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.289382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192","startPage":"732","endPage":"738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A depth-encoded PET detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A depth-encoded PET detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3971053","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A depth-encoded PET detector","sourcePdf":"00289382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05728S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"7192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"48","articleId":"289382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":289396,"authors":[{"name":"L.D.

The substrate upper surface is treated as reflective except for a small section, intended to represent a reverse-biased junction, which is treated as a sink. Total charge collected by the sink is calculated by assuming transport to be governed by an ambipolar diffusion equation with temporally constant and spatially uniform carrier lifetime and diffusion coefficient. Present results apply to a normally incident track but could easily be generalized to arbitrary track direction. The collected charge is found to depend on track length and on the electrostatic capacitance, rather than the area, of the sink. Theoretical predictions are compared to the results of a numerical simulation called the Poisson and Continuity Equation Solver (PISCES) for three cases and are found to agree within a factor of two in the worst case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7192/00289397.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.289397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.289397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charged collected by diffusion from an ion track under mixed boundary conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Equations","Surface treatment","Silicon devices","Charge carrier lifetime","Charge carrier density","Space technology","Electrostatics","Capacitance","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor counters","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ion track","reverse-biased junction","ambipolar diffusion equation","carrier lifetime","diffusion coefficient","electrostatic capacitance","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","displayDocTitle":"Charged collected by diffusion from an ion track under mixed boundary conditions","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3971065","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charged collected by diffusion from an ion track under mixed boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00289397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034673S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"7192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"11","articleId":"289397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":289402,"authors":[{"name":"Roh Myung-Sub","affiliation":["Research Center, Korea Electric Power Corporation, South Korea"],"lastName":"Roh Myung-Sub","id":"37087435290"},{"name":"Cheon Se-Woo","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Cheon Se-Woo","id":"37087436588"},{"name":"Chang Soon-Heung","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang Soon-Heung","id":"37087436138"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"289402","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Neural networks","Predictive models","Power system modeling","Artificial neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Data preprocessing","Steady-state","Reactor instrumentation","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fusion reactor instrumentation","neural nets","nuclear engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power prediction system","artificial neural network paradigm","parity space signal validation technique","input preprocessing","backpropagation network algorithm","network learning","steady-state high-power level","nuclear power plant","instrumentation problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289402","abstract":"A power prediction system was developed using an artificial neural network paradigm that was combined with a parity space signal validation technique.

It is projected that capacity improvement will be of the order of 5-10 times that of analog FM without adding any cell sites. For example, the North American TIA (Telecommunication Industry Association) standard offers around 50 Erlang/km/sup 2/ with a 3-km site-to-site distance. In addition, the TDMA principle allows a faster handoff mechanism (mobile assisted handoff), which makes it easier to introduce microcells with a cell radius of about 200 m. This gives substantial additional capacity gain beyond the 5-10 factor given above. TDMA makes it possible to introduce adaptive channel allocation (ACA) methods. ACA is a mechanism that provides efficient microcellular capacity. ACA also eliminates the need to plan frequencies for cells. It is concluded that the air-interface of digital TDMA cellular may be used to build personal communication networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of digital cellular TDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.289413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7193/00289413.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.289413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of digital cellular TDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3971221","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of digital cellular TDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00289413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023366S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"7193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"99","articleId":"289413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":289414,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

For statistically independent diversity paths, estimates of average attainable error rates and outage probabilities as functions of system parameters are provided. The dependences among the important system parameters are exhibited graphically for several examples, including quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK). In the optimized uncoded QPSK with 1.5 b/s/Hz, two orders of magnitude in outage probability can be gained by diversity reception. When one compares the uncoded average probability of error for the optimized mean squared error (MSE) systems one finds at most an order-of-magnitude difference among the different equalizers investigated except for the zero-forcing equalizer, whose performance is drastically inferior to the others. Again, dual diversity can provide two orders of magnitude improvement in the average error rate or in outage probability for the uncoded optimized systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.289415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.289415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7193/00289415.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual diversity combining and equalization in digital cellular mobile radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Dual diversity combining and equalization in digital cellular mobile radio","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3971223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual diversity combining and equalization in digital cellular mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00289415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030529S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"7193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"118","articleId":"289415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":289417,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Based on the physical phenomena of multipath fading and signal shadowing, an analog model of the land mobile satellite channel which can readily be used for software and hardware fading simulation is developed. The most important parameter of this model is the time-share of shadowing. The Rice factor which characterizes the channel during unshadowed periods, can vary from 3.9 to 18.1 dB.

Consequently, very fast adaptation methods are necessary to cope with the time- and frequency-selective distortions produced by Rayleigh and multipath fading. The authors examine a few theoretical aspects of the application of recursive least squares (RLS) adaptation algorithms to the narrowband TDMA mobile radio system and give the relevant performance results for the fast Kalman algorithm, which turns out to be suitable for the considered application. In particular, signature curves, bit error rate, speed of convergence, steady-state behavior, numerical stability, required accuracy, and hardware complexity are discussed. Linear transversal and nonlinear decision-feedback equalizers are considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast adaptive equalizers for narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.289420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7193/00289420.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.289420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fast adaptive equalizers for narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3971228","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast adaptive equalizers for narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00289420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036529S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"7193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","articleId":"289420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":289422,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Square-root Nyquist filters are used with roll-off, beta , the transmitter and receiver as in the proposed US digital mobile radio system. The presence of the second path has a profound effect on increasing the bit error probability (BEP) because it causes ISI. In the absence of ISI, ACI has a smaller effect on BEP than CCI. In the presence of ISI their effect is essentially the same. For a given bit energy-to-noise ratio, the binary system has the lowest BEP; however, the bit rate is also the lowest for a given bandwidth. When the main interference is ACI or CCI, a quaternary system has a lower BEP than the octal system.

These sonar signals are waveforms in one dimension (1-D). The hidden Markov model (HMM) is well suited to classification of 1-D signals such as speech. In HMM methodology, the signal is divided into a sequence of frames, and each frame is represented by a feature vector. This sequence of feature vectors is then modeled by one HMM. Thus, the HMM methodology is highly suitable for classifying the patterns that are made of concatenated sequences of micro patterns. The sonar transient signals often display an evolutionary pattern over the time scale. Following this intuition, the application of HMM's to sonar transient classification is proposed and discussed in this paper. Toward this goal, three different feature vectors based on an autoregressive (AR) model, Fourier power spectra, and wavelet transforms are considered in our work. In our implementation, one HMM is developed for each class of signals. During testing, the signal to be recognized is matched against all models. The best matched model identifies the signal class. The neural net (NN) classifier has been successfully used previously for sonar transient classification. The same set of features as mentioned above is then used with a multilayer perceptron NN classifier.

In order to account for these effects, we consider a receiver which performs optimal phase synchronization and channel equalization jointly. Since the intersymbol interference in some underwater acoustic channels spans several tens of symbol intervals, making the optimal maximum-likelihood receiver unacceptably complex, we use a suboptimal, but low complexity, decision feedback equalizer. The mean squared error multiparameter optimization results in an adaptive algorithm which is a combination of recursive least squares and second-order digital phase and delay-locked loops. The use of a fractionally spaced equalizer eliminates the need for explicit symbol delay tracking. The proposed algorithm is applied to experimental data from three types of underwater acoustic channels: long-range deep water, long-range shallow water, and short-range shallow water channels. The modulation techniques used are 4- and 8-PSK. The results indicate the feasibility of achieving power-efficient communications in these channels and demonstrate the ability to coherently combine multiple arrivals, thus exploiting the diversity inherent in multipath propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.289455","startPage":"100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7194/00289455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.289455","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-coherent digital communications for underwater acoustic channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Phase-coherent digital communications for underwater acoustic channels","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4703162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-coherent digital communications for underwater acoustic channels","sourcePdf":"00289455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030434S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"7194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"454","articleId":"289455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":289514,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The design incorporates positive feedback to increase the gain bandwidth response by as much as 50 %. The active feedback amplifier achieves a gain of 13.8 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 15.6 GHz. The active feedback is economical in size in comparison to a spiral inductor implementation. In addition, the active feedback network includes a means for electronically tuning the active feedback circuit in order to adjust the bandwidth response. A two-stage design achieves a tuneable bandwidth from 4-10 GHz with a fixed gain of 20 dB. The tuneability that this design offers is a convenient means for recovering from gain and bandwidth degradation due to process variation and fixture parasitics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.289514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/7197/00289514.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.289514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel heterojunction bipolar transistor active feedback design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel heterojunction bipolar transistor active feedback design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4709819","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel heterojunction bipolar transistor active feedback design","sourcePdf":"00289514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041429S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"11","articleId":"289514","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":289515,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The circuit has a systolic mesh structure with single clock control, bidirectional data flow, and an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converting interface.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289579/","accessionNumber":"4677149","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single-chip realization of a fuzzy logic controller with neural network structure (NNFLC)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-chip realization of a fuzzy logic controller with neural network structure (NNFLC)","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00289579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03938S","chronDate":"24-27 May 1993","isNumber":"7198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"901","articleId":"289579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":289589,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The ORCA has an architecture that assures dense layouts of all major types of functionality needed, including data path, random logic, and SRAM. The ORCA FPGA utilizes a novel approach to routing interconnect to achieve a 40% to 100% increase in density over traditional SRAM-based FPGA architectures. The resulting compaction of logic functions into fewer programmable logic cells coupled with dedicated fast arithmetic circuits permits system clock rates of 80 MHz. The ORCA software was designed in parallel with the architecture to insure that all of the benefits of the architecture would be accessible to users through the algorithms of the software. This eliminates the need for users to obtain a detailed knowledge of the architecture in order to use it efficiently. Instead, high-density, high-speed designs are produced automatically by software, with virtually no need for manual intervention on the part of the user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Feb. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4750285","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-26 Feb. 1993","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"ORCA: a high speed, high density FPGA architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ORCA: a high speed, high density FPGA architecture","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00289697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020073S","chronDate":"22-26 Feb. 1993","isNumber":"7199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"903","citationCount":"3","articleId":"289697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":289700,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

Each CFB can be configured as a PLD block or as a bank of SRAMs. CFBs configured as PLD blocks include advanced features that provide significant design flexibility and high integration. Truly predictable timing simplifies the design and simulation process. The inherent speed of the FLEXlogic FPGA family, together with its selectable 3.3-V or 5-V I/O, allows it to be used in areas where previous FPGA architectures cannot operate.

With this approach, video playback, capture, and compression are possible on a low-cost system. Also, the ability to handle multiple concurrent streams of video becomes possible.

As a case study, we consider the problem of providing a reliable service despite node failures by executing a group of replicated servers. Replica creation and management as well as failure detection and recovery are performed automatically by a separate fault tolerance layer (ft-layer) which is inserted between the server application and the operating system kernel. The layer is invisible for the application since it provides the same functional interface as the operating system kernel, thus making the fault tolerance property of the service completely transparent for the application. A major advantage of our architecture is that the layer encapsulates both fault tolerance mechanisms and policies. This allows for maximum flexibility in the choice of appropriate methods for fault tolerance without any changes in the application code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Mar 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4653238","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application-transparent fault tolerance in distributed systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-transparent fault tolerance in distributed systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00289937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029202S","chronDate":"21-23 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"944","citationCount":"6","articleId":"289937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":289979,"authors":[{"name":"J.-A.

Finally it explores the automatic generation of arbitrary TTAs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLSV.1994.289981","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 4th Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 4th Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel2/959/7203/00289981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLSV.1994.289981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of transport triggered architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of transport triggered architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289981/","conferenceDate":"4-5 March 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4677659","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of transport triggered architectures","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00289981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033005S","chronDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"959","citationCount":"26","articleId":"289981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":289988,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

This heuristic partitions inputs as well as outputs. Experimental results show that the sizes of submachines are much smaller than the size of original machine. As a result, the distributed smaller submachines can be operated faster than the original machine because of shorter critical paths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 4th Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 4th Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel2/959/7203/00289988.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based synthesis of FSMs through decomposition","doi":"10.1109/GLSV.1994.289988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLSV.1994.289988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=289988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/289988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based synthesis of FSMs through decomposition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4677652","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 March 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based synthesis of FSMs through decomposition","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00289988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038648S","chronDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"959","citationCount":"1","articleId":"289988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"}]
