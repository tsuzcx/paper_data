A practical, ubiquitous WPT infrastructure could offer tremendous benefits for mobile devices, such as extending battery lifetime, on-the-fly recharging, or, in some cases, eliminating batteries and pesky charging cords altogether. But these benefits can be achieved only if the spatial and temporal distribution of wireless power can be controlled. The authors consider approaches to achieving control over the distribution of long-range (electromagnetic far-field) wireless power, using multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) concepts adapted from the communication domain. They survey recent results in MIMO WPT theory and experiment, and conclude with their own experimental evidence that MIMO WPT can leverage the physics of multipath propagation to selectively enhance or block wireless power delivery, with a typical control range of 20 dB (100 times) in practical indoor environments. This article is part of a special issue on energy harvesting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Wireless Power Transfer for Mobile Devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","doi":"10.1109/MPRV.2016.67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756/7676133/07676167.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPRV.2016.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7676133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Wireless Power Transfer for Mobile Devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7676167/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16411204","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Wireless Power Transfer for Mobile Devices","sourcePdf":"mpc2016040036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059894S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756","isNumber":"7676133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7756","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7676133","articleId":"7676167","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7676243,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

Recently, techniques have been developed to create images of cavitation activity to provide investigators with a more complete set of information. These techniques use arrays to record and subsequently beamform received cavitation emissions, rather than processing emissions received on a single-element transducer. In this paper, the methods for performing frequency-domain delay, sum, and integrate passive imaging are outlined. The method can be applied to any passively acquired acoustic scattering or emissions, including cavitation emissions. To compare data across different systems, techniques for normalizing Fourier transformed data and converting the data to the acoustic energy received by the array are described. A discussion of hardware requirements and alternative imaging approaches is additionally outlined.

These complex fade realizations constitute the modulation alphabet. MBM has the advantage of increased spectral efficiency and performance. In this paper, we investigate the performance of some physical layer techniques when applied to MBM. Particularly, we study the performance of1) MBM with generalized spatial modulation (GSM), 2) MBM with mirror activation pattern (MAP) selection based on a Euclidean distance (ED)-based metric, and 3) MBM with feedback-based phase compensation and constellation rotation (PC-CR). Our results show that for the same spectral efficiency, GSM-MBM can achieve better performance compared to MIMO-MBM. Also, it is found that MBM with ED-based MAP selection results in improved bit error performance, and that phase compensation and MBM constellation rotation increases the ED between the MBM constellation points and improves the performance significantly. We also analyze the diversity orders achieved by the ED-based MAP selection scheme and the PC-CR scheme. The diversity orders predicted by the analysis are validated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2620989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2620989","startPage":"4967","endPage":"4983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07676245.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Media-Based Modulation Using RF Mirrors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"On Media-Based Modulation Using RF Mirrors","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965039","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676245/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Bose National Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006143","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Media-Based Modulation Using RF Mirrors","sourcePdf":"tvt-chockalingam-2620989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148902S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7676245","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676246,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Carlo Ferrante","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Information Systems Technology and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7782900/7676246/ferra-2620958-small.gif","p":["Guido Carlo Ferrante (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received a double\n Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Rome, Italy, and\n CentraleSup\u00e9elec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, in April 2015.

While sticking to the traditional structure of the training phase where orthogonal pilot sequences are reused in different cells, we propose a group-blind detector that takes into account the presence of pilot contamination. Our detector uses the excess antennas to partially remove interference during the data transmission phase. We derive asymptotic expressions for the SINR gain and the achievable rate in the massive regime, i.e., when the number of antennas tends to infinity while keeping the number of users per cell fixed. Implementing the group-blind detector requires an estimate of the aggregate out-of-cell channel covariance. We propose a simple scheme, referred to as method of silences, to obtain such estimate. Numerical results confirm our analysis in practical scenarios, and show cases where the method of silences achieves a large fraction of the promised SINR gain over conventional detectors.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7782900/07676246.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-Blind Detection for Uplink of Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676246/","displayDocTitle":"Group-Blind Detection for Uplink of Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"65","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16561954","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676246/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-Blind Detection for Uplink of Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-ferrante-2620958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168324S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7782900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7782900","articleId":"7676246","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676247,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Kosari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7676247/kosar-2621033-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Kosari received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering\n from Shiraz University, Fars, Iran, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering,\n Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), Tehran, Iran, in 2004.

Although with the P-f droop method, an accurate active power sharing can be achieved among distributed energy resources (DERs), by Q-V droop, the reactive power sharing among DERs often deteriorates due to its highly dependence on the power line impedances and the local load. Variation of frequency and voltage by load changes is another challenge in droop control method. In this paper, a new autonomous control method is proposed to share reactive power among DERs accurately and restore frequency of a microgrid. The proposed method does not require any communication link and so maintains reliability and simplicity of the network. The synchronizing among DERs is obtained by the load change detection, which is accomplished by wavelet transform. The method operation principle is explained and analyzed.

In mobile cognitive radio ad hoc networks (MCRAHNs) where nodes can move, SUs are intermittently connected because of node mobility, as well as the uncertain channel availability. Providing multicast services in MCRAHNs is urgently needed with the compelling demand on service qualities and varieties, and the proliferation of cognitive technology. The benefits of network coding over multicast in traditional wireless networks or CRNs have been well demonstrated in existing works. However, the existing studies merely address the two crucial issues (i.e., uncertain channel availability and node mobility) together and, thereby, cannot be applied to network coding-based multicast in MCRAHNs. In this paper, we study the problem of network coding-based multicast in MCRAHNs considering both channel uncertainty and node mobility. We utilize discrete-time Markov chains to model the channel availability and node mobility in MCRAHNs, and we then formulate a spectrum-aware network coded multicast problem as an optimization problem, which minimizes the total transmission cost, subject to the timely successful delivery constraint and link transmission constraint. Since the formulated problem is hard to tackle according to mixed integer programing, we further design a distributed spectrum-aware cost-based (SACB) scheme based on the metric of forwarding benefit. With extensive simulations based on both synthetic and realistic traces, we show that, compared with existing schemes, SACB can achieve almost the minimum transmission cost while maintaining high multicast success probability.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7951139/7676248-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965061","htmlLink":"/document/7676248/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-Aware Network Coded Multicast in Mobile Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National NSF of China","grantNumber":"61103224, 61371124, 61472445 and 61571463"},{"fundingName":"NSF of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2011118 and BK20140076"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Spectrum-Aware Network Coded Multicast in Mobile Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-qu-2621007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114293S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7676248","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676251,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Hu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7676251/hu-2621040-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Hu (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communications and information system.

We consider a practical scenario, where the multi-antenna transmitter only obtains partial channel knowledge from the single-antenna receiver through limited training and feedback but has no channel knowledge about the single-antenna eavesdropper. In the design, we first propose a three-period block transmission protocol to capture the practical training and quantization features. We then characterize the statistics of the received signal-to-noise ratios at the receiver and the eavesdropper. Under the secrecy outage constraint, we exploit the ON-OFF scheme to perform secure transmission and derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy throughput. Moreover, we investigate the optimization problem of maximizing the secrecy throughput by proposing an iterative algorithm to determine the optimal power allocation between the information signal and artificial noise, as well as the optimal codeword transmission rate. Furthermore, we define the net secrecy throughput (NST), which takes the signaling overhead into account and address the problem of optimally allocating the block resource to the training and feedback overhead. Numerical results clearly demonstrate how the optimal signaling overhead changes with the number of transmit antennas, and there exists an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the NST.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial-Noise-Aided Secure Transmission Scheme With Limited Training and Feedback Overhead","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2621040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07676251.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2621040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Artificial-Noise-Aided Secure Transmission Scheme With Limited Training and Feedback Overhead","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7676251/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618424","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371122"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP150103905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial-Noise-Aided Secure Transmission Scheme With Limited Training and Feedback Overhead","sourcePdf":"twc-hu-2621040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128605S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7676251","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676254,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangang Hu","affiliation":["Standard Drives, Rockwell Automation Inc., Mequon, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7931767/7676254/hu-2621048-small.gif","p":["Jiangang Hu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the\n Ph.D. degree from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, in 2007.","He is a Senior Project Engineer in Standard Drives, Rockwell Automation, Mequon, WI, USA.

However, there are also some drawbacks in accurately detecting and locating a ground fault in adjustable speed drive (ASD) systems: 1) the HRG fault current (1-10 A) cannot reliably trip the overcurrent protection function in drives; 2) the existing methods are based on the line voltage/frequency (50/60 Hz), making it hard to detect and locate low-voltage/low-frequency ground faults; and 3) with the existing methods, the possible fault locations will be manually checked one by one using an Ammeter by a trained technician.

It is driving the telecommunication industry as well as the research community to come up with new paradigms that will support such high data rate requirements within the existing wireless access network, in an efficient and effective manner. To respond to this challenge, device-to-device (D2D) communication in cellular networks is viewed as a promising solution, which is expected to operate, either within the coverage area of the existing eNB and under the same cellular spectrum (in-band) or separate spectrum (out-band). D2D provides the opportunity for users located in close proximity of each other to communicate directly, without traversing data traffic through the eNB. It results in several transmission gains, such as improved throughput, energy gain, hop gain, and reuse gain. However, integration of D2D communication in cellular systems at the same time introduces new technical challenges that need to be addressed. Containment of the interference among D2D nodes and cellular users is one of the major problems. D2D transmission radiates in all directions, generating undesirable interference to primary cellular users and other D2D users sharing the same radio resources resulting in severe performance degradation. Efficient interference mitigation schemes are a principal requirement in order to optimize the system performance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing interference mitigation schemes present in the open literature. Based on the subjective and objective analysis of the work available to date, it is also envisaged that adopting a multi-antenna beamforming mechanism with power control, such that the transmit power is maximized toward the direction of the intended D2D receiver node and limited in all other directions will minimize the interference in the network. This could maximize the sum throughput and hence, guarantees the reliability of both the D2D and cellular connections.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"7967","endPage":"7987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07676255.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Mitigation in D2D Communication Underlaying LTE-A Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676255/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interference Mitigation in D2D Communication Underlaying LTE-A Network","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16509376","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Interference Mitigation in D2D Communication Underlaying LTE-A Network","sourcePdf":"access-safdar-2621115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172793S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7676255","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676257,"authors":[{"name":"Hongtao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7676257/hzhan-2621183-small.gif","p":["Hongtao Zhang (M\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2008.

However, the severe interference under dense TP deployment in UCN from co-channel neighbor cell worsens the user performance. In this paper, to combat the fluctuation of user rate, a user-centric power control strategy is proposed, where TPs will take power control coefficient \u03b2 to effectively mitigate the strong interference for each user within TPG of radius coefficient \u03bc. Based on the strategy, semi-closed expressions of network downlink performance metric are first derived, including coverage probability and average achievable rate to the typical user, and average spectral efficiency of TP with the consideration of the impact of TPG overlapping on the signal link. The TPs and the users are modeled as independent 2-D Poisson point processes. The theoretical analysis confirms that the optimization of \u03b2 and \u03bc, which determine the area and intensity for power control, respectively, can realize the tradeoff between interference mitigation and resource utilization. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains of the user-centric power control strategy in coverage probability, average achievable user rate, and TP spectral efficiency, which can be improved at most by 30%, 15%, and 42%, respectively. In addition, the analysis gives the optimal values of \u03b2 and \u03bc according to the distance between TP and user.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621183","startPage":"7347","endPage":"7355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07676257.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control for 5G User-Centric Network: Performance Analysis and Design Insight","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Power Control for 5G User-Centric Network: Performance Analysis and Design Insight","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470595","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676257/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302090"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016XD-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372114, 61571054 and 61631005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Power Control for 5G User-Centric Network: Performance Analysis and Design Insight","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2621183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151272S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7676257","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676258,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Compared to orthogonal frequency division multiple access, which is a well-known high-capacity orthogonal multiple access technique, NOMA offers a set of desirable benefits, including greater spectrum efficiency. There are different types of NOMA techniques, including power-domain and code-domain. This paper primarily focuses on power-domain NOMA that utilizes superposition coding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation at the receiver. Various researchers have demonstrated that NOMA can be used effectively to meet both network-level and user-experienced data rate requirements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies. From that perspective, this paper comprehensively surveys the recent progress of NOMA in 5G systems, reviewing the state-of-the-art capacity analysis, power allocation strategies, user fairness, and user-pairing schemes in NOMA. In addition, this paper discusses how NOMA performs when it is integrated with various proven wireless communications techniques, such as cooperative communications, multiple-input multiple-output, beamforming, space-time coding, and network coding among others.

However, the traditional mains power supply is not necessarily ubiquitous in this large-scale wireless network. Furthermore, the non-uniform geographic distribution of both the based-stations and the tele-traffic requires carefully considered user association. Relying on the rapidly developing energy harvesting techniques, we focus our attention on the sophisticated access point (AP) selection strategies conceived for the energy harvesting aided super-WiFi network. Explicitly, we propose a solar radiation model relying on the historical solar activity observation data provided by the University of Queensland, followed by a beneficial radiation parameter estimation method. Furthermore, we formulate both a Markov decision process (MDP) as well as a partially observable MDP (POMDP) for supporting the users' decisions on beneficially selecting APs. Moreover, we conceive iterative algorithms for implementing our MDP and POMDP-based AP-selection, respectively. Finally, our performance results are benchmarked against a range of traditional decision-making algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar radiation","Batteries","Energy harvesting","Wireless networks","Solar energy","Photovoltaic cells","Data models","Green communications","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","Markov processes","solar activity","telecommunication power management","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POMDP","partially observable MDP","Markov decision process","historical solar activity observation data","solar radiation model","energy harvesting aided super-WiFi network","access point selection strategies","user association","nonuniform geographic distribution","large-scale wireless network","nationwide Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super WiFi network","access point selection algorithm","energy harvesting model","MDP","POMDP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676267","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07676267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621361","startPage":"3785","endPage":"3797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Association Strategies for an Energy Harvesting Aided Super-WiFi Network Relying on Measured Solar Activity","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/7801957/7676267-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network Association Strategies for an Energy Harvesting Aided Super-WiFi Network Relying on Measured Solar Activity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676267/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","volume":"34","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7676267/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581264","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC China","grantNumber":"61371079 and 91338203"},{"fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CPS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121 and NSFC 61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Network Association Strategies for an Energy Harvesting Aided Super-WiFi Network Relying on Measured Solar Activity","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2621361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102571S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7676267","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676279,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Bae Kong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7676279/kong-2621360-small.gif","p":["Han-Bae Kong (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2009, 2011, and 2015, respectively.

This paper considers ambient RF energy harvesting wireless sensor networks where a sensor node transmits data to a data sink using the energy harvested from the signals transmitted by the ambient RF sources. We analyze the performance of the network, i.e., the mean of the harvested energy, the power outage probability, and the transmission outage probability. In many practical networks, the locations of the ambient RF sources are spatially correlated and the ambient sources exhibit repulsive behaviors. Therefore, we model the spatial distribution of the ambient sources as an \u03b1-Ginibre point process (\u03b1-GPP), which reflects the repulsion among the RF sources and includes the Poisson point process as a special case. We also assume that the fading channel is Nakagami-m distributed, which also includes Rayleigh fading as a particular case. In this paper, by exploiting the Laplace transform of the \u03b1-GPP, we introduce semi-closed-form expressions for the considered performance metrics and provide an upper bound of the power outage probability. The derived expressions are expressed in terms of the Fredholm determinant, which can be computed numerically. In order to reduce the complexity in computing the Fredholm determinant, we provide a simple closed-form expression for the Fredholm determinant, which allows us to evaluate the Fredholm determinant much more efficiently. The accuracy of our analytical results is validated through simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","volume":"34","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"16581232","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676279/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exact Performance Analysis of Ambient RF Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks With Ginibre Point Process","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 1","grantNumber":"RG122/15 and RG18/13"},{"fundingName":"MOE Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2013-T2-2-070 ARC16/14 and MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC 4/15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Performance Analysis of Ambient RF Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks With Ginibre Point Process","sourcePdf":"jsac-flint-2621360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143382S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7676279","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676280,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Wadayama","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Tadashi Wadayama (M\u201995) was born in Kyoto, Japan, on May 9, 1968.

A pooling graph is a bipartite graph for which the adjacency matrix is a pooling matrix. The binary status of the objects to be tested are modeled by independent identically distributed. Bernoulli random variables with probability p. An (l, r, n)regular pooling graph is a bipartite graph in which the left nodes have degree l, the right nodes have degree r, and n is the number of left nodes. The main contribution of this paper is a direct coding theorem that gives the conditions for the existence of an estimator that can achieve an arbitrarily small probability of error. An estimator is a function that uses observations to infer the state of an object. The direct coding theorem is proved by averaging the upper bound on the probability of the estimation error of the typical set estimator over an (l, r, n)regular pooling graph ensemble. Numerical results indicate sharp threshold behaviors in the asymptotic regime. These results can provide a concrete benchmark for nonadaptive group testing of existing and emerging detection algorithms over a noiseless system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"63","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16669097","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676280/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonadaptive Group Testing Based on Sparse Pooling Graphs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"25289114 and 16H02878"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Nonadaptive Group Testing Based on Sparse Pooling Graphs","sourcePdf":"tit-wadayama-2621112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155749S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7676280","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676281,"authors":[{"name":"Jiyong Woo","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7739934/7676281/woo-2615648-small.gif","p":["Jiyong Woo received the M.S. degree in materials science and engineering from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea, in 2012.

In this context, a hybrid access point transfers energy to a group of nodes, which use the harvested energy to perform computation or transmission tasks. While the availability of the wireless energy transfer mechanism opens up new frontiers, an appropriate choice of the network parameters (e.g., transmission powers, transmission duration, and amount of transferred energy) is required in order to achieve high performance. In this paper, we study the throughput optimization problem in a system composed of an access point, which recharges the batteries of two devices at different distances. In the literature, the main focus so far has been on slot-oriented optimization, in which all the harvested energy is used in the same slot in which it is harvested. However, this approach is strongly suboptimal, because it does not exploit the possibility to store the energy and use it at a later time. Thus, instead of considering the slot-oriented case, we address the long-term maximization. This assumption greatly increases the optimization complexity, as it requires to consider, e.g., the channel state statistics and the batteries evolution. Our objective is to find the best scheduling scheme, both for the energy transferred by the access point and for the data sent by the two nodes. We discuss how to perform the maximization with optimal as well as approximate techniques and show that the slot-oriented policies proposed so far are strongly suboptimal in the long run.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598314","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676282/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Battery-Powered Devices in WPCNs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery-Powered Devices in WPCNs","sourcePdf":"tcomm-biason-2621109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098858S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7676282","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7676286,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Tao Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hao-Tao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085611145"},{"name":"Fu-Chang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fu-Chang","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-9866-091X","id":"37309679600"},{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Xin","lastName":"Chu","orcid":"0000-0001-7647-5086","id":"37285768100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7676286","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1873},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Directive antennas","Antenna arrays","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","directive antennas","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","slot antenna arrays","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact directional slot antenna","MIMO array","microstrip-fed slot antenna","directive radiation pattern","WLAN-WiMAX application","two-element array topology","unidirectional radiation pattern","square loop array","orthogonal patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","directive antenna","multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system","slot antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this communication, a new design for the microstrip-fed slot antenna with a directive radiation pattern for WLAN/WiMAX application is presented.

The chipless tag consists of nested concentric coplanar square loops, and adjacent loops are connected by two stub lines at the center of the opposite sides, respectively. There are two critical factors in achieving small size. One is due to the integration of multiple square loops in a nested structure, sharing the same sides. The structure is designed to obtain the following function relationship between the loop number n and resonant mode number N: N = 2(n - 1). The other critical factor for minimization is that it is the coupling of adjacent loops that responds to resonances. The gap size only influences the coupling strength, and shifts resonance frequency a little, and does not influence the sharp-edged resonance in spite of small gap. This is one highlight. The other highlight is that four variations can be independently adjusted on the basis of the proposed reference tag, and a lot of different encoding identifications can be obtained. In addition, the proposed tag also has the following advantages. The proposed tag is magnetic, and the radar cross section (RCS) magnitude is insensitive to the medium where it is pasted. High RCS magnitude is realized at the condition of minimization. The connected coplanar square loop resonators are reused in both vertical and horizontal polarizations to double the encoding capacity within a fixed bandwidth. The RCS curve keeps unchanged until the orientation angle rotates up to 35\u00b0. An 18-bit tag is developed by the proposed nested loops, and 19bits/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n data density is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2016.2618928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7855842/07676298.pdf","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2016.2618928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Dual-Polarized Chipless RFID Tag by Using Nested Concentric Square Loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676298/","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Dual-Polarized Chipless RFID Tag by Using Nested Concentric Square Loops","volume":"16","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16841094","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676298/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313462"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61071056"},{"fundingName":"Characteristics of Innovation Foundation of Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014KTSCX017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Dual-Polarized Chipless RFID Tag by Using Nested Concentric Square Loops","sourcePdf":"lawp-huang-2618928-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042721S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7855842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7855842","articleId":"7676298","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676305,"authors":[{"name":"Andres E.

The inclusion of a feed-forward compensation improves the disturbance rejection capability against asymmetrical faults and sudden voltage imbalances in the ac grid. The floating capacitor voltages of the MMC are controlled in two stages. The first one equally distributes the voltages in each arm, and the second one balances the energy among the six arms. This last control stage is also divided into the called horizontal and vertical balancing. Based on a detailed analysis of the power terms disturbing the MMC arm energies, the control strategy is tailored to improve the voltage transient response by adding feed-forward terms to both horizontal and vertical balancing controls. In addition, various approaches to manage the MMC under unbalanced grid conditions are compared regarding several aspects, such as capacitor voltage ripple, balancing performance, and negative-sequence current injection. Advantages and disadvantages of both the proposed and the conventional energy-based control schemes are also studied, showing that the voltage control performance can be improved by enhancing the existing MMC control systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","volume":"32","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"16773916","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676305/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Balancing Improvement of Modular Multilevel Converters Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002923","fundingName":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005740","fundingName":"Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Balancing Improvement of Modular Multilevel Converters Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions","sourcePdf":"tpel-leon-2621000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098157S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7886374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7886374","articleId":"7676305","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676307,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Barcelo","affiliation":["Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7676307/barce-2621398-small.gif","p":["Marc Barcelo received the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. (cum laude) degree from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB) in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

With the predicted explosion in the number of connected devices and IoT services, current centralized cloud architectures, which tend to consolidate computing and storage resources into a few large data centers, will inevitably lead to excessive network load, end-to-end service latencies, and overall power consumption. Thanks to recent advances in network virtualization and programmability, highly distributed cloud networking architectures are a promising solution to efficiently host, manage, and optimize next generation IoT services in smart environments. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the service distribution problem (SDP) in IoT-Cloud networks, referred to as the IoT-CSDP, as a minimum cost mixed-cast flow problem that can be efficiently solved via linear programming. We focus on energy consumption as the major driver of today's network and cloud operational costs and characterize the heterogeneous set of IoT-Cloud network resources according to their associated sensing, computing, and transport capacity and energy efficiency. Our results show that, when properly optimized, the flexibility of IoT-Cloud networks can be efficiently exploited to deliver a wide range of IoT services in the context of next generation smart environments, while significantly reducing overall power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07676307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","startPage":"4077","endPage":"4090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IoT-Cloud Service Optimization in Next Generation Smart Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IoT-Cloud Service Optimization in Next Generation Smart Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581292","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676307/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"TEC2014-53656-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IoT-Cloud Service Optimization in Next Generation Smart Environments","sourcePdf":"jsac-llorca-2621398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093631S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7676307","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676309,"authors":[{"name":"Gozde Ozcan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7676309/ozcan-2621399-small.gif","p":["Gozde Ozcan received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Syracuse University in 2016.

In this setting, the optimization problem is to maximize energy efficiency (EE) subject to peak/average transmission power constraints and peak/average interference constraints. By exploiting the quasi-concave property of the EE maximization problem, the original problem is transformed into an equivalent parameterized concave problem, and an iterative power allocation algorithm based on Dinkelbach's method is proposed. The optimal power levels are identified in the presence of different levels of channel side information (CSI) regarding the transmission and interference links at the secondary transmitter, namely, perfect CSI of both transmission and interference links, perfect CSI of the transmission link, imperfect CSI of the interference link, imperfect CSI of both links, or only statistical CSI of both links. Through numerical results, the impact of sensing performance, different types of CSI availability, and transmit and interference power constraints on the EE of the secondary users is analyzed.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/7801957/7676309-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676309/","volume":"34","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7676309/","accessionNumber":"16581241","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Systems With Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1443966, ECCS-1443994 and CCF-1618615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Energy-Efficient Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Systems With Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"jsac-ozcan-2621399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122933S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7676309","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7676317,"authors":[{"name":"Amirreza Alizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7847453/7676317/aliza-2615932-small.gif","p":["Amirreza Alizadeh (S\u201910) received the B.S degree from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2012.

Extensive load-pull (LP) and source-pull (SP) simulations are performed to show that class-J PAs are less sensitive to proper termination of higher order harmonics, and high PAE and output power can be obtained even if the second, third, fourth, and fifth harmonics comprise a real impedance. This is essential in DPAs as the higher order harmonics of the frequencies at lower side of the band may fall in the desired bandwidth.

Achieving a high-resolution (HR) depth map from a low resolution (LR) depth map or densely reconstructing a sparse non-uniformly sampled depth map are fundamentally similar problems with different types of upsampling requirements. The first problem involves upsampling in a uniform grid, whereas the second type of problem requires an upsampling in a non-uniform grid. In this paper, we propose a new approach to address such issues in a unified framework, based on sparse representation. Unlike, most of the approaches of depth map restoration, our approach does not require an HR intensity image. Based on example depth maps, sub-dictionaries of exemplars are constructed, and are used to restore HR/dense depth map. In the case of uniform upsampling of LR depth map, an edge preserving constraint is used for preserving the discontinuity present in the depth map, and a pyramidal reconstruction strategy is applied in order to deal with higher upsampling factors. For upsampling of non-uniformly sampled sparse depth map, we compute the missing information in local patches from that from similar exemplars. Furthermore, we also suggest an alternative method of reconstructing dense depth map from very sparse non-uniformly sampled depth data by sequential cascading of uniform and non-uniform upsampling techniques. We provide a variety of qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for depth map restoration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7743013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2621410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7743013/07676324.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"134","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2621410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Map Restoration From Undersampled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Depth Map Restoration From Undersampled Data","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7676324/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16465665","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2016","pubMedId":"27831871","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Map Restoration From Undersampled Data","sourcePdf":"tip-mandal-2621410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141275S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7743013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7743013","articleId":"7676324","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7676325,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed S.

However, implementing on-chip communication is still a designer's burden wherein custom system-level buses are implemented using the fine-grained FPGA logic and interconnect fabric. Instead, we propose augmenting FPGAs with an embedded network-on-chip (NoC) to implement system-level communication. We design custom interfaces to connect a packet-switched NoC to the FPGA fabric and I/Os in a configurable and efficient way and then define the necessary conditions to implement common FPGA design styles with an embedded NoC. Four application case studies highlight the advantages of using an embedded NoC. We show that access latency to external memory can be ~1.5\u00d7 lower. Our application case study with image compression shows that an embedded NoC improves frequency by 10-80%, reduces utilization of scarce long wires by 40% and makes design easier and more predictable. Additionally, we leverage the embedded NoC in creating a programmable Ethernet switch that can support up to 819 Gb/s-5\u00d7 more switching bandwidth and 3\u00d7 lower area compared to previous work. Finally, we design a 400 Gb/s NoC-based packet processor that is very flexible and more efficient than other FPGA-based packet processors.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2621045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7921657/07676325.pdf","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2621045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Applications for Embedded Networks-on-Chip on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and Applications for Embedded Networks-on-Chip on FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676325/","accessionNumber":"16880664","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Applications for Embedded Networks-on-Chip on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tc-abdelfattah-2621045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100903S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7921657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7921657","articleId":"7676325","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676328,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation and National Engineering Laboratory of Energy-Saving Motor and Control Technique, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7886374/7676328/hang-2621164-small.gif","p":["Jun Hang (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.\n degrees in electrical engineering from Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, China, in 2008 and 2011,\n respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2016.

A nine-phase FSPM machine topology is first introduced and no-load back electromotive force waveforms are analyzed. Moreover, the topologies of the nine-phase FSPM drive with different neutral-point connection modes are studied. Then, the mathematical model of a nine-phase FSPM machine with HRC is established with the consideration of the neutral-point connection mode and then the influence of the HRC on the ZSVC is analyzed based on the established model. It is shown that the HRC may be diagnosed by monitoring the change of the spectral contents of the ZSVC. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the situation of the nine-phase FSPM machine with one neutral point. In this case, to remove the influence of the FSPM machine operating point, an effective fault indicator is defined and used for HRC fault detection. Finally, the simulation and the experiment are carried out to validate the proposed method. Both the results show that the proposed method can be applied for the HRC fault diagnosis in a nine-phase FSPM machine.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Topology","Harmonic

In an asynchronous PNC system, when the nodes are not equally distant from the relay, the path lengths from the nodes to the relay can vary sufficiently to cause the superimposed waveforms to be evidently offset in time. These arrival time differences, also influenced by the discrepancy of node-clocks, can lead to severe performance degradation and must be estimated in practice. To deal with this problem, a novel symbol timing estimator with baud-rate sampling is proposed in this letter, which is based on the a priori knowledge of the pulse-shaping function. Compared with the known techniques with high oversampling factor, the proposed scheme shows the lower complexity advantage with the unit oversampling factor and better mean square error performance when the excess bandwidth factor of the pulse-shaping function is at 0.3.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2621046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07676329.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2621046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Symbol Timing in Physical-Layer Network Coding With Arrival Time Differences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Symbol Timing in Physical-Layer Network Coding With Arrival Time Differences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676329/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16668377","htmlLink":"/document/7676329/","volume":"21","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Funds of China","grantNumber":"61172078, 61571224 and 61571225"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu, China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Symbol Timing in Physical-Layer Network Coding With Arrival Time Differences","sourcePdf":"lcomm-dang-2621046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063149S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7676329","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7676337,"authors":[{"name":"Akihide Sai","affiliation":["Wireless System Laboratory, Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7756673/7676337/sai-2603993-small.gif","p":["Akihide Sai received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2002, 2004, respectively.","He joined the Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan, in 2004.

The dual-camera design of CASSI, by adding an uncoded panchromatic measurement, enhances the reconstruction fidelity while maintaining the snapshot advantage. In this paper, we propose an adaptive nonlocal sparse representation (ANSR) model to boost the performance of dual-camera compressive hyperspectral imaging (DCCHI). Specifically, the CS reconstruction problem is formulated as a 3D cube based sparse representation to make full use of the nonlocal similarity in both the spatial and spectral domains. Our key observation is that, the panchromatic image, besides playing the role of direct measurement, can be further exploited to help the nonlocal similarity estimation. Therefore, we design a joint similarity metric by adaptively combining the internal similarity within the reconstructed hyperspectral image and the external similarity within the panchromatic image. In this way, the fidelity of CS reconstruction is greatly enhanced. Both simulation and hardware experimental results show significant improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8024097/07676344.pdf","startPage":"2104","endPage":"2111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2621050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2621050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024097","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonlocal Sparse Representation for Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Hyperspectral imaging","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Spectral analysis","Image coding","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","compressed sensing","hyperspectral imaging","image reconstruction","image representation","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlocal similarity estimation","panchromatic image","3D cube based sparse representation","CS reconstruction problem","ANSR","reconstruction fidelity","uncoded panchromatic measurement","3D hyperspectral data recovery","CASSI","coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging","CS theory","compressive sensing","DCCHI","dual-camera compressive hyperspectral imaging","adaptive nonlocal sparse representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","dual-camera","hyperspectral imaging","nonlocal similarity","sparse representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Nonlocal Sparse Representation for Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging","volume":"39","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7676344/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17153711","pubMedId":"28113743","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472301, 61227004, 61671419 and 61425026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006296","fundingName":"CAS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Nonlocal Sparse Representation for Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging","sourcePdf":"tpami-xiong-2621050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099152S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8024097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8024097","articleId":"7676344","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676346,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7747553/7676346/liao-2621057-small.gif","p":["Bin Liao (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013.

Among the state-of-the-art solutions, this problem is tackled by iterative subspace estimation algorithms to incorporate subspace-based approaches or nonlinear optimization routines to bypass the direct identification of subspaces. In this paper, the problem of DOA estimation in nonuniform noise is revisited by devising two computationally efficient proposals. It is proved herein that, if the signals are uncorrelated, the signal and noise subspaces can be directly obtained from the eigendecomposition of a reduced array covariance matrix. On the other hand, when the signals are correlated, the estimation of the noise covariance matrix is formulated into a rank minimization problem which can be approximately solved by semidefinite programming. In both cases, the signal and noise subspaces are easy to compute without iterations. Consequently, classical subspace-based algorithms can be employed to determine the DOAs. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance and applicability of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7747553/07676346.pdf","startPage":"8982","endPage":"8989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2016.2621057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2621057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7747553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Approaches to Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Sensor Arrays in Unknown Nonuniform Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Sensor arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","iterative methods","matrix decomposition","minimisation","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","sensor arrays","subspace-based DOA estimation algorithms","unknown spatially nonuniform noise","iterative subspace estimation algorithms","nonlinear optimization","direct subspace identification","noise subspaces","reduced array covariance matrix eigendecomposition","noise covariance matrix estimation","semidefinite programming","rank minimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor array processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","nonuniform noise","semidefinite programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"New Approaches to Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Sensor Arrays in Unknown Nonuniform Noise","volume":"16","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7676346/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"16466490","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401284, 61601307 and 61601300"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140418091413566, JCYJ20160422102022017 and JCYJ20150324140036835"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"827-000071"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approaches to Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Sensor Arrays in Unknown Nonuniform Noise","sourcePdf":"jsen-liao-2621057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122449S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7747553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7747553","articleId":"7676346","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7676347,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Pepe","affiliation":["Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland","Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dell\u2019Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7676347/pepe-2605659-small.gif","p":["Domenico Pepe (S\u201908\u2013M\u201909) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Pisa and the University of Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux, France, in 2009.","He is a Senior Researcher at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.

The SPARCS can be applied to high-dimensional prediction problems in experimental science, medicine, finance, and engineering, as illustrated by the following. Suppose that one wishes to run a sequence of experiments to learn a sparse multivariate predictor of a dependent variable Y (disease prognosis for instance) based on a p dimensional set of independent variables X = [X\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n,..., X\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n]\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sup>\n (assayed biomarkers).

In the second stage, we collect a larger number (t - n) of cheaper samples of the l variables that passed the screening of the first stage. At the second stage, a low-dimensional predictor is constructed by solving the standard regression problem using all t samples of the selected variables. The SPARCS is an adaptive online algorithm that implements false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for the familywise error rate, specify high dimensional convergence rates for support recovery, and establish optimal sample allocation rules to the first and second stages.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7792231/7676357-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676357/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16636512","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Sampling, Prediction and Adaptive Regression via Correlation Screening","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1217880, DMS-CMG-1025465, AGS-1003823, DMS-1106642 and DMS-CAREER-1352656"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-13-1-0043"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0479"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Two-Stage Sampling, Prediction and Adaptive Regression via Correlation Screening","sourcePdf":"tit-firouzi-2621111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146695S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7792231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7792231","articleId":"7676357","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7676366,"authors":[{"name":"Esmail Babakrpur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Esmail","lastName":"Babakrpur","orcid":"0000-0002-3462-3180","id":"37085807325"},{"name":"Won Namgoong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Won","lastName":"Namgoong","id":"37271204500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7676366","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Mixers","Receivers","Impedance","Baseband","Sensors","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","frequency synthesizers","impedance matching","mixers (circuits)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent harmonic sensing matching","passive mixer-first receiver topology","LO harmonics","reduced tuning range requirements","frequency synthesizer","single joint harmonic matching performance","zero-IF M-phase mixer-first receiver","antenna impedance","12-phase harmonic-sensing mixer first receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Harmonic sensing","impedance matching","LO harmonic","noise figure (NF)","passive mixer","return loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8016697/07676366.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2620982","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2620982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching for Concurrent Harmonic Sensing in an ${M}$ -Phase Mixer-First Receiver","abstract":"This brief proposes the use of passive mixer-first receiver topology to sense signals at higher LO harmonics. The advantages of such a receiver include sensing of multiple bands concurrently and reduced tuning range requirements in the frequency synthesizer. The single and joint harmonic matching performance of a zero-IF M-phase mixer-first receiver is analyzed. It is shown that minimum possible return loss for joint matching occurs when the geometric mean of input impedances at the highest and lowest sensing bands equals the antenna impedance. The noise figure (NF) when sensing higher order LO harmonics is shown to result in only modest degradation, with the loss becoming even less with increasing number of LO phases. As an example, a 12-phase harmonic-sensing mixer first receiver is simulated and its performance at first, third, and fifth harmonics is evaluated in terms of input matching and NF.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8920/8016697/7676366-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"17135429","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676366/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Matching for Concurrent Harmonic Sensing in an ${M}$ -Phase Mixer-First Receiver","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1310279"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Matching for Concurrent Harmonic Sensing in an ${M}$ -Phase Mixer-First Receiver","sourcePdf":"tcsii-babakrpur-2620982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064029S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8016697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8016697","articleId":"7676366","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676372,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanyu Ma","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7676372/ma-2616445-small.gif","p":["Zhanyu Ma (M\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2011.","From 2012 to 2013, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Two fundamental invertible transformations, namely, serial nonlinear transformation and parallel nonlinear transformation, are proposed to carry out the decorrelation. For a neutral vector variable, which is not multivariate-Gaussian distributed, the conventional principal component analysis cannot yield mutually independent scalar variables. With the two proposed transformations, a highly negatively correlated neutral vector can be transformed to a set of mutually independent scalar variables with the same degrees of freedom. We also evaluate the decorrelation performances for the vectors generated from a single Dirichlet distribution and a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The mutual independence is verified with the distance correlation measurement. The advantages of the proposed decorrelation strategies are intensively studied and demonstrated with synthesized data and practical application evaluations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

presents a new and effective approach for designing a high-selectivity tunable balanced bandpass filter (BPF) with constant absolute bandwidth (ABW). The filter is composed of two open-loop resonators with a pair of symmetrically loaded varactor diodes to obtain tunable responses. The major design concept relies on choosing the particular position on the resonator for loading the varactor diodes. The desired variation slopes of the external quality factor and coupling coefficient can be easily obtained for realizing the constant ABW of the tunable BPF. Frequency-dependent source-load coupling between the feed lines are introduced for realizing two adaptive transmission zeros (TZs) on both sides of the tunable passband. Thus, during the frequency-tuning process, high selectivity of the proposed filter can be kept. Meanwhile, the common-mode suppression is optimized to an acceptable level in the frequency-agile range of the differential-mode passband by loading the stub and resistor in the series at the center of the resonator. For demonstration, a tunable balanced BPF with the constant ABW and two TZs is designed and implemented. The simulated and measured results are presented, showing good agreement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17136442","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676373/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Selectivity Tunable Balanced Bandpass Filter With Constant Absolute Bandwidth","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271136"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BK20161281"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Selectivity Tunable Balanced Bandpass Filter With Constant Absolute Bandwidth","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chen-2621120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080993S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7995149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7995149","articleId":"7676373","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676375,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany","University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7676375/zappo-2621379-small.gif","p":["Alessio Zappone (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911\u2013SM\u201916) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy.

The assignment between users and subcarriers is allocated together with the users' transmit powers for energy efficiency maximization, by means of a novel approach which merges the popular Dinkelbach's algorithm with the frameworks of distributed auction theory and stable matching. Two distributed algorithms are presented, which can be implemented in a fully decentralized way. The former is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the system energy efficiency, up to a threshold which can be set in advance, while the latter enjoys weaker optimality properties, but has an even lower computational complexity. Additionally, we develop a novel energy consumption model which explicitly accounts for the energy consumption due to feedback transmissions. Employing this new model, it is shown that the proposed distributed algorithms can even outperform centralized resource allocations which require a larger feedback energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07676375.pdf","startPage":"3451","endPage":"3465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Energy Efficiency in MIMO OFDMA Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676375/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Energy Efficiency in MIMO OFDMA Wireless Networks","volume":"34","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581268","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676375/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"ZA 747/1-3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001736","fundingName":"German\u2013Israel Foundation for Scientific Research and Development","grantNumber":"I-1243-406.10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Energy Efficiency in MIMO OFDMA Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-zappone-2621379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151716S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7676375","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676377,"authors":[{"name":"Mitchell D.

High-voltage spikes induced in applications such as solenoid control, solid-state transformer, boost converter, and flyback converter can drive the MOSFET into avalanche mode operation due to high di/dt coupled with parasitic inductance. Avalanche mode operation is characterized by high-power dissipation within the device due to the high voltage and current crossover. This study focuses on the evaluation of two commercially available SiC MOSFETs from different manufacturers, each rated for 1200 V with an ON-state resistance of 80 m\u03a9, during unclamped inductive switching (UIS) mode operation. To determine device reliability, a decoupled UIS testbed was developed to evaluate the avalanche energy robustness at 22 \u00b0C and 125 \u00b0C during two specific conditions: high current and low energy, and low current and high energy. The SiC MOSFETs were evaluated using a load inductance of 1.42, 5.1, 10.5, and 15.8 mH to understand the effect of current and avalanche energy on device failure. To correlate the experimental results with the failure mechanism, estimated junction temperature and static device characteristics are presented; additionally, MOSFETs were decapsulated to examine the failure sites on the semiconductor die.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2621099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7886374/07676377.pdf","startPage":"6405","endPage":"6415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2621099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Pulse Avalanche Mode Robustness of Commercial 1200 V/80 m\u03a9 SiC MOSFETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676377/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Pulse Avalanche Mode Robustness of Commercial 1200 V/80 m\u03a9 SiC MOSFETs","volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"16773925","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676377/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Pulse Avalanche Mode Robustness of Commercial 1200 V/80 m\u03a9 SiC MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"tpel-kelley-2621099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139499S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7886374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7886374","articleId":"7676377","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676379,"authors":[{"name":"Shwan Ashrafi","affiliation":["Qualcomm Corporate R&D in San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shwan Ashrafi received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2016.

Most prior work has focused on the homogeneous case, where all the mobile users are assumed to have identical packet arrival rates and transmission probabilities. The inhomogeneous case remains largely open in the literature. In this paper, we make a first step toward this open problem by deriving throughput and delay expressions for inhomogeneous CSMA, with a particular focus on a family of MPR models. This family of MPR models, which allows us to overcome several challenges associated with conventional analysis, is general enough to include a number of interesting MPR techniques-such as successive interference cancellation, compute-and-forward (C&F), and successive C&F (SCF)-as special cases. Based on these throughput and delay expressions, we provide theoretical guidelines for the network design to meet quality-of-service requirements and to achieve global stability; we also evaluate the performances of various MPR techniques, highlighting the clear advantages offered by SCF.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2621103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2621103","startPage":"230","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07676379.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of CSMA With Multi-Packet Reception: The Inhomogeneous Case","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7818052/7676379-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of CSMA With Multi-Packet Reception: The Inhomogeneous Case","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598317","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7676379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1205725 and 1443923"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Performance Analysis of CSMA With Multi-Packet Reception: The Inhomogeneous Case","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ashrafi-2621103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16735S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7676379","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676380,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Nsengiyumva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Nsengiyumva","id":"37085551016"},{"name":"Lloyd W.

This new paradigm of data hosting service also introduces new security challenges that require an independent auditing service to check the integrity of the data in the cloud. Some existing methods for checking the integrity of the data cannot handle this problem efficiently and they cannot deal with the error condition. Thus, a secure and efficient dynamic auditing protocol should reject requests that are made with improper authentication. In addition, an excellent remote data authentication method should be able to collect information for statistical analysis, such as validation results. In this paper, first we design an auditing framework for cloud storage systems and propose an efficient and privacy-preserving auditing protocol. Then, we extend our auditing protocol to support dynamic data operations, which is efficient and has been proven to be secure in the random oracle model. We extended our auditing protocol further to support bidirectional authentication and statistical analysis. In addition, we use a better load distribution strategy, which greatly reduces the computational overhead of the client. Last, we provide an error response scheme, and our experiments show that our solution has good error-handling ability and offers lower overhead expenses for computation and communication than other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07676382.pdf","startPage":"7899","endPage":"7911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Protocol With Bidirectional Verification for Storage Security in Cloud Computing","topic":"Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676382/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Protocol With Bidirectional Verification for Storage Security in Cloud Computing","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7676382/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16509357","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401060, 61601214, 61501080 and 61572095"},{"fundingName":"General Program of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Science Research","grantNumber":"L2014017"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT16QY09"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Efficient Protocol With Bidirectional Verification for Storage Security in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"access-qiu-2621005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088406S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing"],"articleId":"7676382","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676388,"authors":[{"name":"Shaobo Lv","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaobo","lastName":"Lv","id":"37086070917"},{"name":"Chengwen Xing","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Xing","id":"37392522900"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279639900"},{"name":"Keping Long","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Keping","lastName":"Long","id":"37270462800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7676388","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676388","abstract":"In this paper, the critical issues associated with interference management in device-to-device (D2D) aided underlaying cellular networks are addressed. To mitigate the severe interference imposed by activating D2D links, a guard zone based D2D-activation scheme is proposed by enabling the successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities at the base stations (BSs). Furthermore, the exact closed-form expressions for the successful transmission probability (STP) of cellular users (CUEs) are derived by assuming a uniform distribution of both CUEs and D2D users (DUEs) within a given geographical area. After that, the approximated average throughput of CUEs is derived, relying on the method of Taylor-series expansion. In addition, the guard zone's inner radius can be optimized under the criteria of maximizing both STP and average throughput. Numerical results show that both the STP and average throughput of CUEs can be substantially improved by invoking the proposed interference management scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Interference","Silicon carbide","Throughput","Closed-form solutions","Receivers","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference suppression","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard zone based interference management","D2D-aided underlaying cellular networks","device-to-device-activation scheme","successive interference cancellation","SIC","exact closed-form expressions","base stations","BS","successful transmission probability","cellular users","CUE","Taylor-series expansion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device (D2D)","guard zone","interference management","successive interference cancellation (SIC)","underlaying cellular network"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2621051","startPage":"5466","endPage":"5471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07676388.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2621051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guard Zone Based Interference Management for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Guard Zone Based Interference Management for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","accessionNumber":"16965063","publicationDate":"June 2017","volume":"66","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676388/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"5G research program of the China Mobile Research Institute","grantNumber":"[2015] 0615"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431001"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005372","fundingName":"Ministry of Education (Guilin University of Electronic Technology)"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of the Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guard Zone Based Interference Management for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lv-2621051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144746S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7676388","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7676390,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Aittom\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7676390/aitto-2620960-small.gif","p":["Tuomas Aittom\u00e4ki (M\u201914) received the M.Sc.

In order to achieve this goal, mismatched filters may be employed at the receivers. By using mismatched filters, it is possible to reduce the power of the interference while strictly controlling the autocorrelation sidelobe and peak cross-correlation levels of the received waveforms. In this paper, we propose a mismatched filter design method that minimizes interference and jamming power at the filter output while the peak sidelobe and cross-correlation levels for all Doppler frequencies are constrained to desired values. The proposed design method is formulated as an optimization problem employing sum-of-squares representation of non-negative polynomials and solved using semidefinite relaxation. It is demonstrated that good interference suppression performance is achieved even when using an estimated covariance matrix.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7748608/07676390.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatched Filter Design and Interference Mitigation for MIMO Radars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Doppler effect","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO radar","Optimization","Receivers","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","covariance matrices","interference suppression","jamming","MIMO radar","optimisation","polynomials","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar receivers","mismatched filter design","interference mitigation","autocorrelation sidelobe","peak cross-correlation levels","received waveforms","jamming power","Doppler frequency","optimization problem","sum-of-squares representation","nonnegative polynomials","semidefinite relaxation","interference suppression","covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","filter design","mismatched filter","interference suppression","jamming","convex optimization","semidefinite relaxation","polynomial constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mismatched Filter Design and Interference Mitigation for MIMO Radars","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7676390/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16466523","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Finnish Defence Research Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatched Filter Design and Interference Mitigation for MIMO Radars","sourcePdf":"tsp-aittomaki-2620960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087318S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7676390","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676391,"authors":[{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7676391/liu-2620962-small.gif","p":["An Liu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201909) received the Ph.D. and B.S.\n degrees in electrical engineering from Peking University, China, in 2011 and 2004, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Visiting Scholar in the Department of ECEE, University of Colorado at Boulder.

There are two performance bottlenecks in such heterogeneous networks (HetNet): the interference issue and cell-edge effect. We propose to combine cell-free BS-user association (BUA), power control, and dynamic user-side interference cancellation (IC) to mitigate these bottlenecks. By dynamically selecting the \u201cbest\u201d serving BSs for each user, the cell-free BUA can exploit the multi-BS diversity gain to mitigate the interference and cell-edge effect. Furthermore, the user-side IC eliminates the strong cross-tier interference. We formulate the joint optimization of cell-free BUA, power allocation, and user-side IC as a weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem, and propose a WMMSE alternating optimization algorithm to solve it. Specifically, a generalized WMMSE method is proposed to solve the power optimization subproblem with nondifferentiable WSR function. Furthermore, by exploiting the specific problem structure, low complexity search methods are designed to find the optimal solutions of the combinatorial cell-free BUA and user-side IC subproblems. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to a stationary solution of the joint problem. Simulations verify the significant gain of the proposed solution over existing solutions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7748608/07676391.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"345","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint BS-User Association, Power Allocation, and User-Side Interference Cancellation in Cell-free Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint BS-User Association, Power Allocation, and User-Side Interference Cancellation in Cell-free Heterogeneous Networks","htmlLink":"/document/7676391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16466522","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"N-HKUST605/13"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint BS-User Association, Power Allocation, and User-Side Interference Cancellation in Cell-free Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2620962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08556S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7676391","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676394,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, School of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/7762698/7676394/chen-2617680-small.gif","p":["Wei Chen was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1987.

Key establishment is the core component in key management schemes and plays a crucial role in satisfying the security requirements. In recent years, many key establishment protocols have been proposed in the context of smart grids. However, their high overhead and complexity have undermined their ability to be practically employed in AMI. In this paper, we propose a novel identity-based key establishment protocol which employs elliptic curves at its core and has the lowest computational overhead among current secure protocols, especially at the meter side. We have given a detailed and comparative analysis of both security and computational burden for the proposed protocol as well as the previous efforts. We have evaluated the resilience of different protocols to well-known attacks by discussion, however, for the proposed protocol, we have also used AVISPA tool to formally verify its security. Compared to the previous solutions, the proposed protocol either is more secure or scores higher in performance benchmarks run on the same hardware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Identity-Based Key Establishment Method for Advanced Metering Infrastructure in Smart Grid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2620939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07676395.pdf","startPage":"2834","endPage":"2842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2620939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Identity-Based Key Establishment Method for Advanced Metering Infrastructure in Smart Grid","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7676395/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857408","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Identity-Based Key Establishment Method for Advanced Metering Infrastructure in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-sayadhaghighi-2620939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071079S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7676395","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7676400,"authors":[{"name":"Abhay Kumar Sah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7676400/sah-2620978-small.gif","p":["Abhay Kumar Sah (S\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat (H.P.), India, in 2010.

However, finding the right sequence order has an exponential overhead. In view of this, we propose to repeatedly apply a BFTS algorithm to all sequence orders. Since it will test all the orders, it is expected to achieve quasi-ML performance. However, this will increase the complexity because of redundant iterations. The complexity can be reduced if we can stop the iterations as soon as a quasi-ML solution is achieved. For this, we propose two stopping rules, one relies on a constellation based heuristic and the other one uses the distribution of ML cost. It is found that their complexity curves have a cross-over point. Thus, a combination of the two rules provides a quasi-ML error performance at a low-complexity for uncoded as well as coded systems. We further show that the proposed stopping rule can reduce the complexity of depth first tree search algorithms also. Last, for large MIMO systems, compared with existing algorithms, it is found to be exceptionally better in terms of both error performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2620978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07676400.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2620978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stopping Rule-Based Iterative Tree Search for Low-Complexity Detection in MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676400/","displayDocTitle":"Stopping Rule-Based Iterative Tree Search for Low-Complexity Detection in MIMO Systems","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618450","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7676400/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tata Consultancy Services Ltd"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stopping Rule-Based Iterative Tree Search for Low-Complexity Detection in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-sah-2620978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180624S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7676400","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7676401,"authors":[{"name":"Daeyoung Park","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37275454300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7676401","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Decoding","Transmitters","MIMO","Optimization","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy rate improvement","joint decoding","Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel","helping interferer","receiver","transmitter","secret communication","independent artificial interference transmission","secrecy rate maximization problem","alternating optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial interference","joint decoding","secrecy","wiretap channels"]}],"abstract":"In a wiretap channel, a transmitter sends confidential messages to an intended legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper.

In the discrete-memoryless wiretap channel with a helper, we characterize the achievable secrecy rates by comparing the strength of interference at the legitimate receiver and at the eavesdropper.

The T/H buffer bandwidth mismatch stems from the length difference of interconnect lines between the buffer and the channel ADC, while the sampler bandwidth mismatch arises from the mismatch in a switch and a sampling capacitor. To address both mismatches along with other mismatches residing in TI-ADCs, this papers utilizes least-squares (LS) minimization technique in order to extract mismatch parameters while injecting a sinewave at two distinct frequencies. Programmable capacitor arrays (PCAs) are used to tune the bandwidth of sampler, and correcting buffer bandwidth mismatch is performed in digital-domain. The method presented here is scalable to arbitrary number of interleaved paths, and can easily be combined with existing calibration methods for gain, offset, and timing-skew mismatches. Numerical experiment via Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrates significant performance improvement in the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) from 38 dB to 75 dB for a 32-channel time-interleaved ADC model that includes all major mismatches.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2593927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7676403","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1897","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7676403/07676404.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2593927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Bandwidth Mismatch Calibration Technique for Time-Interleaved ADCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Calibration","Integrated circuit interconnections","Linearity","Capacitors","Analog-digital conversion","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","buffer circuits","calibration","least squares approximations","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable bandwidth mismatch calibration technique","time-interleaved ADC","foreground calibration method","track-and-hold buffer bandwidth mismatch","T/H buffer bandwidth mismatch","sampler circuit","sampling capacitor","least-squares minimization technique","sinewave","programmable capacitor array","PCA","digital-domain","timing-skew mismatch","Monte-Carlo simulation","spurious-free dynamic range","SFDR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital conversion","bandwidth mismatch","channel mismatch","time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters (TI-ADCs) calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Bandwidth Mismatch Calibration Technique for Time-Interleaved ADCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7676404/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16411239","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korea Government (Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning)","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A2A1A03070988"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Bandwidth Mismatch Calibration Technique for Time-Interleaved ADCs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kim-2593927-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084758S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7676403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7676403","articleId":"7676404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7676407,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Cheng","affiliation":["EXPOSE/PIEM/GEEPS, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, 11 rue Joliot Curie Plateau de Moulon, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"bio":{"p":["Xi Cheng received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in\n electrical engineering from Xi\u2019dian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the\n Ph.D. degree in physics from Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, France, in 2015.","She did her research within the Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes (from 2012 to 2014) and Group of\n electrical engineering, Paris (GeePs) (from 2015 until she got her Ph.D degree) at CentraleSup\u00e9lec.

The uncertainty in SAR calculation is quantified by three nonintrusive UQ methods: unscented transformation, stochastic collocation, and nonintrusive polynomial chaos. Their performances for the cases of one and two random variables are analyzed. To simplify the UQ procedure for the case of multiple uncertain inputs, it is demonstrated that uncertainties can be combined to evaluate the parameter uncertainty of the output. To quantify the relative importance of each uncertain input parameter with respect to the uncertainty of the output, the polynomial chaos based Sobol' indices method is used in SAR calculation for sensitivity analysis. The results of the investigations are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2016.2605127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/7676405/07676407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2016.2605127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7676405","startPage":"14","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Different Methods to Quantify Uncertainty in Specific Absorption Rate Calculation Using a CAD-Based Mobile Phone Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Different Methods to Quantify Uncertainty in Specific Absorption Rate Calculation Using a CAD-Based Mobile Phone Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16408881","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676407/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Different Methods to Quantify Uncertainty in Specific Absorption Rate Calculation Using a CAD-Based Mobile Phone Model","sourcePdf":"temc-cheng-2605127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116414S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"7676405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7676405","articleId":"7676407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7676410,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-xiang Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7676403/7676410/hu-2591264-small.gif","p":["Hong-xiang Hu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Zhejiang Gongshang University in 2005, the M.S. degree in mathematics from Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology in 2013.

The weights between the agents in the same sub-network are positive, while the weights between the agents among different sub-networks are negative. Then, the reverse group consensus is firstly studied without the in-degree balance condition. By defining the mirror graph and establishing the solution of the multi-agent system, it is found that the reverse group consensus problem can be achieved if the mirror graph is strongly connected. The explicit expression of the error level is also derived, which would be vanished for multi-agent systems with some special kinds of inputs. Furthermore, as an extension, the decomposing of the cooperation-competition network is discussed, where the concept of the condensation undirected graph and the path balance condition are defined, and several effective sufficient conditions are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2591264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2591264","startPage":"2036","endPage":"2047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7676403/07676410.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7676403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse Group Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems in the Cooperation-Competition Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Reverse Group Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems in the Cooperation-Competition Network","volume":"63","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16411249","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7676410/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503103, 61572439, 61573096, 61322302, 61304168 and 61273212"},{"fundingName":"National Ten Thousand Talent Program for Young Top-notch Talents"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LQ14F030011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20130595"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of First Level Zhejiang Key in Key Discipline of Control Science and Engineering"},{"fundingName":"Information Processing and Automation Technology Prior Discipline of Zhejiang Province-Open Research Foundation","grantNumber":"20150709"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse Group Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems in the Cooperation-Competition Network","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hu-2591264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179434S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7676403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7676403","articleId":"7676410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7676411,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Totev","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7676403/7676411/totev-2593341-small.gif","p":["Emil Totev was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1975.

It is known that the performance of target scene recovery in CS scenarios depends highly on the coherence of the sensing matrix, which is determined by the radar transmit waveform. In this paper, we propose efficient transmit waveform optimization approaches for two different structures of the radar waveform, namely, the single-pulse and the more general pulse-train scenarios. By determining the identical coherence values associated with the sensing matrices of CS-based radars, the suggested methods provide a considerable reduction in the number of optimization variables. We show that, in the single-pulse scenario, fast Fourier transform operations can be used to improve the computation speed, whereas efficient power method-like iterations may be employed in the pulse-train scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated through several numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating the Few: Sparsity-Aware Waveform Design for Active Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07676417.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Locating the Few: Sparsity-Aware Waveform Design for Active Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7676417/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2016","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16486378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating the Few: Sparsity-Aware Waveform Design for Active Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-soltanalian-2620966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090007S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7676417","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7676419,"authors":[{"name":"Long Wang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7676419/wang-2621135-small.gif","p":["Long Wang (S\u201916) received the M.Sc.

A preliminary data analysis is performed to demonstrate that existing SCADA features are unable to present irregular patterns prior to occurrences of blade breakages. A deep autoencoder (DA) model is introduced to derive an indicator of impending blade breakages, the reconstruction error (RE), from SCADA data. The DA model is a neural network of multiple hidden layers organized symmetrically. In training DA models, the restricted Boltzmann machine is applied to initialize weights and biases. The back-propagation method is subsequently employed to further optimize the network structure. Through examining SCADA data, we observe that the trend of RE will shift by the blade breakage. To effectively detect RE shifts through online monitoring, the exponentially weighted moving average control chart is deployed. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is validated by blade breakage cases collected from wind farms located in China. The computational results prove the capability of the proposed monitoring approach in identifying impending blade breakages.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2621135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07676419.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2621135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","startPage":"2824","endPage":"2833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Turbine Blade Breakage Monitoring With Deep Autoencoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7676419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wind Turbine Blade Breakage Monitoring With Deep Autoencoders","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7676419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857480","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7676419/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CityU 11272216"},{"fundingName":"CityU Strategic Research Grant","grantNumber":"7004700"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Turbine Blade Breakage Monitoring With Deep Autoencoders","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhang-2621135-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111769S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7676419","onlineDate":"25 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"}]
