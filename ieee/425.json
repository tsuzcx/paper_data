The current version of BIST approach is focused on reactive failure detection and provides limited insight into reliability and residual life. A new approach has been developed to monitor product-level damage during shock and vibration. The approach focuses is on the pre-failure space and methodologies for quantification of failure in electronic equipment subjected to shock and vibration loads using the dynamic response of the electronic equipment. Presented methodologies are applicable at the system-level for identification of impending failures to trigger repair or replacement significantly prior to failure. Leading indicators of shock-damage have been developed to correlate with the damage initiation and progression in shock and drop of electronic assemblies. Three methodologies have been investigated for feature extraction and health monitoring including development of a new solder-interconnect built-in reliability test, FFT based statistical-pattern recognition, and time-frequency moments based statistical pattern recognition. The solder-joint built-in-reliability-test has been developed for detecting high-resistance and intermittent faults in operational, fully programmed field programmable gate arrays. Frequency band energy is computed using FFT and utilized as the classification feature to check for damage and failure in the assembly. In addition, the Time Frequency Analysis has been used to study of the energy densities of the signal in both time and frequency domain, and provide information about the time-evolution of frequency content of transient-strain signal. Closed-form models have been developed for the eigen-frequencies and mode-shapes of electronic assemblies with various boundary conditions and component placement configurations. Model predictions have been validated with experimental data from modal analysis. Pristine configurations have been perturbed to quantify the degradation in confidence values with progression of damage. Sensitivity of leading indicators of shock-damage to subtle changes in boundary conditions, effective flexural rigidity, and transient strain response have been quantified. Explicit finite element models have been developed and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, package falloff and solder ball failure. This allows the physical quantification of solder ball crack damage in the form of confidence values and provides a damage index that can be utilized for the health monitoring of solder interconnects in an electronic assembly.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373942","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04250028.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.373942","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Pattern Recognition and Built-in Reliability Test for Feature Extraction and Health Monitoring of Electronics under Shock Loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Pattern Recognition and Built-in Reliability Test for Feature Extraction and Health Monitoring of Electronics under Shock Loads","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250028/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250028/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9739859","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Pattern Recognition and Built-in Reliability Test for Feature Extraction and Health Monitoring of Electronics under Shock Loads","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.181018S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4250028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4250031,"authors":[{"name":"Heeseok Lee","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heeseok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280132000"},{"name":"Yun-Seok Choi","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Seok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37556831100"},{"name":"Eunseok Song","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eunseok","lastName":"Song","id":"37289093500"},{"name":"Kiwon Choi","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiwon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290627000"},{"name":"Taeje Cho","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taeje","lastName":"Cho","id":"37283329900"},{"name":"Sayoun Kang","affiliation":["Interconnect Product and Technology, Semiconductor Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sayoun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37692781600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0984-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0985-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"4250031","dbTime":"65 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":572},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Capacitors","Packaging","Capacitance","Impedance","Integrated circuit interconnections","Electromagnetic interference","Semiconductor device noise","Frequency","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supplies to apparatus","system-in-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power delivery network design","3D SIP integrated over silicon interposer platform","mobile hand-held devices","mobile phone","high speed memory","high capacity data storage device","high performance logic processor","integrated decoupling capacitor"]}],"abstract":"As mobile hand-held devices including mobile phone are required to provide multi-media services more and more, it is necessary that the various hardware including high speed memory, high capacity data storage device, and high performance logic processor are integrated into the limited volume, which results in high density 3D SIP.

The module utilizes a single-chip CMOS optical transceiver containing both transmitter and receiver circuits. 16-channel high-speed photodiode (PD) and VCSEL arrays are flip-chip attached to the low-power CMOS IC. The substrate emitting/illuminated VCSEL and PD arrays operate at 985 nm and include collimating lenses integrated into the backside of the substrate. The IC-OE assembly is then flip-chip attached to a high density organic package forming the transceiver optical module. The exclusive use of flip-chip packaging for both the IC-to-optoelectronic (OE) devices and for the IC-to-organic package minimizes the module footprint and associated packaging parasitics. The OE-on-IC assembly achieves a high area efficiency of 9.4 Gb/s/mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (Schow et al., 2007). The complete organic carrier transceiver package provides a low-cost, low-profile module similar to a conventional chip-carrier that can be directly surface mounted to a circuit board using a conventional BGA solder process. SLC transceiver modules with transmitter and receiver OE-IC arrays were assembled and characterized. Operation of all 16 transmitters in the transceiver module was demonstrated at data rates >10 Gb/s. Similarly, all 16 receiver channels operated error-free at >10 Gb/s. The receiver eye-diagrams were generated using a second transceiver source and therefore constitute a full transceiver optical link.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04250042.pdf","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1261","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.373956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"160-Gb/s Bidirectional Parallel Optical Transceiver Module for Board-Level Interconnects Using a Single-Chip CMOS IC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical interconnections","Transceivers","CMOS integrated circuits","Photonic integrated circuits","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Packaging","High speed optical techniques","Optical arrays","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","flip-chip devices","integrated circuit packaging","integrated optoelectronics","optical interconnections","optical receivers","optical transmitters","photodiodes","semiconductor laser arrays","surface emitting lasers","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional parallel optical transceiver module","board-level interconnects","single-chip CMOS IC","transmitter channels","receiver channels","bidirectional aggregate data rate","16-channel high-speed photodiode","VCSEL arrays","flip-chip packaging","PD arrays","collimating lenses","high-density organic package","IC-to-optoelectronic devices","IC-to-organic package","receiver eye-diagrams","transceiver optical link","bit rate 160 Gbit/s","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"160-Gb/s Bidirectional Parallel Optical Transceiver Module for Board-Level Interconnects Using a Single-Chip CMOS IC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9739869","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"160-Gb/s Bidirectional Parallel Optical Transceiver Module for Board-Level Interconnects Using a Single-Chip CMOS IC","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071529S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4250042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4250098,"authors":[{"name":"K.

[1] In order to meet those requirements, we developed 1) low dielectric and low dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4)material (low-\u03ba material), 2) Cu line formation technology on flat surface of insulation layer. [2] Based on those technologies, we have developed new low-\u03ba material and have evaluated its properties. We measured signal propagation delay of test substrate based on new low-\u03ba material with 50\u03a9 microstrip line and confirm it showed half of signal propagation loss and 1/4 of signal propagation variation in those of current materials. We also confirm significant difference in variation of characteristic impedance and signal transmission by time domain reflectometry (TDR) and time domain transmission(TDT). Other than those evaluations, we also measured power consumption and signal transmission property with 1OO\u03a9 microstrip line. We confirm developed low-\u03ba material show lower power consumption and variation than those of current materials and conclude that developed low-\u03ba material can be used for 1OO\u03a9 design providing lower power consumption. Furthermore, in order to evaluate influence by line designs, we made 50\u03a9 microstrip line with bending points and confirm very little influence by those micro line designs. We also confirm that obtained experimental results match with RLGC model considering skin effect and calculate breakdown of signal propagation loss by the RLGC model. This calculation show line formation technology on flat surface significantly reduce signal propagation loss, therefore, we conclude that flat surface of substrate as well as low dielectric constant and loss tangent are important. From this study, we conclude that line formation technology on flat surface, low dielectric and low loss material greatly contribute to high density, high speed and low power consumption of semiconductor package.","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04250112.pdf","startPage":"1714","endPage":"1719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Interconnect Line Patterns using Flat-Surface and Low-Dielectric-Loss Material under High Speed Signal Propagation","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.374026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.374026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Interconnect Line Patterns using Flat-Surface and Low-Dielectric-Loss Material under High Speed Signal Propagation","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9717845","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250112/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Interconnect Line Patterns using Flat-Surface and Low-Dielectric-Loss Material under High Speed Signal Propagation","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060682S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4250112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250138,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Hyun Hwang","affiliation":["Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jin-Hyun","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37697057400"},{"name":"P.

A polymer material, PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) is used for encapsulating the DNA chip. Channels, reservoirs and valves are formed on the PDMS material by casting method. A double sided adhesive tape is used to bond PDMS substrates and DNA chip. A conical shape reservoir is designed to have minimum dead volume in the reservoir. Filled reservoirs with reagents are sealed by a highly elastic thin rubber membrane. An external actuation is used to apply pressure on the thin rubber membrane to push the fluid from the reservoir to the chip and to output collector. Extraction of DNA/RNA follows a protocol and is defined by a flow rate. A pin valve is designed and inserted inside the reservoir to control the fluid flow. The external actuation pushes the fluid through the pin valve and the fluid flow is proportional to the actuation speed. The actuation speed is calibrated with different flow rate and found to have a linear relation. The cartridge is successfully tested for extraction of DNA from human blood.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.374058","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04250144.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.374058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Integration and Testing of Fluidic Dispensing Control Valve into a DNA/RNA Sample Preparation Micro fluidic Package for Lab on a Chip (LOC) Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design, Integration and Testing of Fluidic Dispensing Control Valve into a DNA/RNA Sample Preparation Micro fluidic Package for Lab on a Chip (LOC) Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250144/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9739899","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250144/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Integration and Testing of Fluidic Dispensing Control Valve into a DNA/RNA Sample Preparation Micro fluidic Package for Lab on a Chip (LOC) Applications","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04078S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4250144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4250161,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Gyeong Yun","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Gyeong","lastName":"Yun","id":"37272000500"},{"name":"Kwang-Seong Choi","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Seong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277047400"},{"name":"Yong-Hwan Kwon","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwan","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37275616700"},{"name":"Joong-Seon Choe","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joong-Seon","lastName":"Choe","id":"37275457700"},{"name":"Jong-Tae Moon","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Tae","lastName":"Moon","id":"37276691100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0984-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0985-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"4250161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"abstract":"Driver amplifier integrated (DAI) 40 Gb/s electroabsorption modulator-integrated DFB Laser (EML) modules were developed.

However, implementation in a real-time system is limited by the relatively high computational complexity of the algorithm. As such, this paper considers dimensionality reduction techniques as a means to reduce this computational cost in order to enable real-time operation. In general, numerous different methods exist to decompose the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) framework upon which the APC algorithm is based. In this paper dimensionality reduction is achieved either by segregating contiguous blocks of the received signal samples or by decimating the received signal. Each of the two approaches then facilitate the approximation of the original MMSE cost function of APC by the sum of lower dimension MMSE cost functions thus yielding filters that require a lower computational cost to implement. The reduced dimension algorithms, collectively denoted as the fast adaptive pulse compression (FAPC) algorithm, substantially reduce the computational cost of APC while still maintaining much of its performance benefit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Real-Time Efficiency for Adaptive Radar Pulse Compression","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374201","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250295.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Real-Time Efficiency for Adaptive Radar Pulse Compression","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250295/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703092","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Real-Time Efficiency for Adaptive Radar Pulse Compression","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074987S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4250296,"authors":[{"name":"Byron M.

In CS, a low-dimensional, nonadaptive, linear projection is used to acquire an efficient representation of a compressible signal directly using just a few measurements. The signal is then reconstructed by solving an inverse problem either through a linear program or a greedy pursuit. We demonstrate that CS has the potential to make two significant improvements to radar systems: (i) eliminating the need for the pulse compression matched filter at the receiver, and (ii) reducing the required receiver analog-to-digital conversion bandwidth so that it need operate only at the radar reflectivity's potentially low \"information rate\" rather than at its potentially high Nyquist rate. These ideas could enable the design of new, simplified radar systems, shifting the emphasis from expensive receiver hardware to smart signal recovery algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374203","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250297.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Radar Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Radar Imaging","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9703094","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250297/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250297/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Radar Imaging","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06138S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"446","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4250310,"authors":[{"name":"Chris D.

MIMO radars have better detection performance and can extract target information more precisely than phased array radars. In this paper, the problem of target detection using temporal coherent pulse terrain is considered for MIMO radars. We have introduced a structure that is suitable for coherent processing. Based on this structure, we have formulated this problem as a hypothesis test. One decision rule is developed for detection of target with unknown amplitude embedded in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) with known power using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Another adaptive scheme for the case of unknown power is presented. We have also proposed an ad-hoc constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector against AWGN with unknown power. Performance of these detectors have been evaluated analytically. The results show the superiority of the MIMO radars with temporal coherent processing over the conventional phased arrays.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374232","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250326.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent Detection for MIMO Radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250326/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Detection for MIMO Radars","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703125","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250326/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Detection for MIMO Radars","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063019S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250332,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, Sudbury, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37695336500"},{"name":"Catherine G.

Based on statistical conditional optimization criteria, the iterative AV algorithm starts from the target vector and adding non-orthogonal auxiliary vector components generates an infinite sequence of tests that converges to the ideal matched filter (MF) processor for any positive definite input autocorrelation matrix. Computationally, the algorithm is a simple recursive procedure that avoids explicit matrix inversion, decomposition, or diagonalization operations. When the input autocorrelation matrix is replaced by a conventional sample-average estimate, the algorithm effectively generates a sequence of MF estimators; their bias converges rapidly to zero and the covariance trace rises slowly and asymptotically to the covariance trace of the familiar adaptive matched filter (AMF). For finite data records, the generated sequence of estimators offers favorable bias/covariance balance and members of the sequence are seen to outperform in probability of detection (for any given false alarm rate) all known and tested adaptive detectors (for example AMF and the multistage Wiener After algorithm). White the issues treated refer to general adaptive detection procedures, the presentation herein is given in the context of joint space-time adaptive processing for array radar.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-data-record Adaptive Detection","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374242","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250336.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Short-data-record Adaptive Detection","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250336/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-data-record Adaptive Detection","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068644S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250341,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon J.

The theory shows that there is the same modulation pattern in time, range and angle by taking the remaining two parameters fixed. The simulation results for radiation patterns of a binomial distribution array are presented. The expressions for determining the position and the angular bearing of a target for this type of antenna array system are given.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374254","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","startPage":"427","endPage":"430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Diverse Array Antenna with Periodic Time Modulated Pattern in Range and Angle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Diverse Array Antenna with Periodic Time Modulated Pattern in Range and Angle","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703146","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Diverse Array Antenna with Periodic Time Modulated Pattern in Range and Angle","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0825S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4250350,"authors":[{"name":"W K Stafford","affiliation":["BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies Limited, Cowes, Isle of Wight, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4250266/4250267/4250350/4250350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bill Stafford graduated (Physics B.Sc.)from Bristol University in 1982 and joined the then Plessey Radar now BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies.

The sample size of test data in ATR evaluation application has been reviewed firstly. We choose the Bayesian method to analyze the problem and select \"minimum length criterion\" to obtain the shortest confidence interval (CI) with the same estimation accuracy. The binomial probability density function is regarded as the likelihood function to calculate the posterior distribution about the metrics. Then CI accuracy requirement in ATR evaluation is discussed. Because the posterior distribution of the metrics depends on the test result, criteria to eliminate the uncertainty from the test result must be considered. The worst outcome (WOC) criterion is chosen to calculate sample sizes for various CI accuracy requirements and the corresponding sample sizes are listed in Table I. Table I shows that the sample size is very large when the CI accuracy requirement is high. Two approaches (specifications and prior information) to reduce the sample size are proposed and discussed. The absolute number of the sample size reduction is great when using the specifications in ATR evaluation applications. Table II contains those minimum sample sizes with various specifications, and its comparison with table I is shown. Whereas the sample size reduction is not large when using prior information because precise prior information about the metrics is always absent. The approximate sample size reductions can be got from table III and IV when considering beta distribution as the prior distribution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374284","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250378.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"589","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Size Analysis for Confidence Interval Estimation of Performance Metrics in ATR Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sample Size Analysis for Confidence Interval Estimation of Performance Metrics in ATR Evaluation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703174","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Size Analysis for Confidence Interval Estimation of Performance Metrics in ATR Evaluation","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057173S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250383,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Furthermore, in this algorithm, considering a uniform linear array (ULA), the angular distance between two sources is multiplied by L - 1: L is the number of antenna elements in the array. Therefore, the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent resolution property compared to other techniques. Moreover, BSS techniques enable this approach to carry out source association along with DOA estimation. Here, we introduce the proposed algorithm and define the corresponding probability of resolution (PR). Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the presented approach in comparison with the existing methods such as MUSIC.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374289","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","startPage":"614","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-Resolution Direction-of-Arrival Estimation via Blind Signal Separation Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Super-Resolution Direction-of-Arrival Estimation via Blind Signal Separation Methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250383/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703179","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250383/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Resolution Direction-of-Arrival Estimation via Blind Signal Separation Methods","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084253S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250385,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio de Maio","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"de Maio","id":"37272858900"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["SELEX Sistemi Integrati, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37274494900"},{"name":"Goffredo Foglia","affiliation":["Electronica S.p.A., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Goffredo","lastName":"Foglia","id":"37272862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0283-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0284-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4250385","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Bayesian methods","Covariance matrix","Testing","Detectors","Training data","Clutter","Probability density function","Signal detection","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","radar detection","radar interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar detection","Gaussian disturbance","Bayesian approach","probability density function","disturbance covariance matrix","homogeneous training data"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider the problem of adaptive radar detection in Gaussian disturbance with unknown spectral properties.

In practice, noise jamming may not always provide an effective ECM against the SAR because of the large power output required to obscure the SAR image. A potentially more potent threat is presented by deception or repeater jamming, which can exploit the SAR processing gain and prevent target identification and classification using relatively low power output. Such jammers are likely to be light, inexpensive and readily deployable. This paper presents an adaptive beamforming (ABF) for SAR technique which can provide robust and efficient suppression of both noise and deception jamming. The paper also includes results from experiments with SAR trials data containing jamming which demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in a system offering using two spatial channels.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374292","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250386.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374292","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","startPage":"630","endPage":"634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Beamforming Technique for Countering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Jamming Threats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Beamforming Technique for Countering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Jamming Threats","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250386/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250386/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703182","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Beamforming Technique for Countering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Jamming Threats","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051556S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4250388,"authors":[{"name":"Webert Montlouis","affiliation":["The Raytheon Company, Sudbury, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Webert","lastName":"Montlouis","id":"37300387400"},{"name":"Pierre-Richard J.

This beamformer, also known as the Capon approach, is widely studied and used. In this paper, we investigate the use of the MVDR to estimate the angle of arrival and angular velocities by modeling the movement of the source emitting signal. As a result a four dimensional MVDR is proposed, to estimate the direction of arrival and angular velocities (DOAV) of moving sources, using a rectangular array of antennas. In order to estimate the emitting source parameters, a four dimensional search is required. In practice, this approach is costly and may not be suitable in realtime applications. To reduce the computational complexity of the approach, we exploit the geometry of the array, together with a parameter dimensionality decoupling technique to perform an initialization based on a subspace decomposition approach. This initialization results in two two-dimensional searches in parallel instead of the standard four-dimensional search. We further show that the initialization procedure fits well with the conventional MVDR concept. The performance of the subspace decomposition approach is demonstrated via simulations. We also investigate the effects of diagonal loading on a small sample size and how it can be used together with the MVDR initialization technique to enhance the performance of the overall MDVR approach.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374294","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250388.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374294","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","startPage":"641","endPage":"646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction of Arrival and Angular Velocities (DOAV) Estimation using Minimum Variance Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Direction of Arrival and Angular Velocities (DOAV) Estimation using Minimum Variance Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250388/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250388/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703184","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of Arrival and Angular Velocities (DOAV) Estimation using Minimum Variance Beamforming","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06264S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250392,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

This paper provides the efficient transmitter array configurations and signal processing methods to improve the cross range resolution and range resolution of the frequency MIMO radar after receiving beamforming. The key is to properly apply the weightings to the multiple subband returns to compensate the delay differences and phase shifts between them. To eliminate the ambiguous images, the nonuniform array and the auxiliary array layout are employed, and the round robin transmission scheme is utilized on the basis of the configuration of the main array plus the auxiliary array. Among them the \"round robin\" transmission scheme can obtain the best cross resolution at cost of decreasing the pulse repeat frequency. In the \"round robin\" transmission scheme, spatial diversity technique can be used to combat the target RCS scintillation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Resolution Frequency MIMO Radar","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374303","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250397.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"High Resolution Frequency MIMO Radar","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250397/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Resolution Frequency MIMO Radar","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109284S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4250423,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Goodman","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Goodman","id":"37296258700"},{"name":"Benjamin Miller","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Miller","id":"37288481800"},{"name":"Gil Raz","affiliation":["GMR Research and Technology, Concord, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Raz","id":"37299290100"},{"name":"Matthew Herman","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Herman","id":"37573191200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0283-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0284-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4250423","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":268},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250423","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Computational complexity","Broadband amplifiers","Multidimensional systems","Multiaccess communication","Baseband","Predistortion","Power amplifiers","Polynomials","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","signal processing","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance power amplifier linearization","digital baseband predistortion","wideband power amplifiers","computational complexity","multidimensional signal space","PA-induced nonlinear distortion","wideband code division multiple access signal","PA linearization performance"]}],"abstract":"Digital baseband predistortion (DBP) is not particularly well suited to linearizing wideband power amplifiers (PAs); this is due to the exorbitant price paid in computational complexity. One of the underlying reasons for the computational complexity of DBP is the inherent inefficiency of using a sufficiently deep memory and a high enough polynomial order to span the multidimensional signal space needed to mitigate PA-induced nonlinear distortion. Therefore we have developed a new mathematical method to efficiently search for and localize those regions in the multidimensional signal space that enable us to invert PA nonlinearities with a significant reduction in computational complexity. Using a wideband code division multiple access (CDMA) signal we demonstrate and compare the PA linearization performance and computational complexity of our algorithm to that of conventional DBP techniques using measured results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2007.374329","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4250266/4250267/04250423.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"845","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2007.374329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Achieving High-Performance Power Amplifier Linearization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Achieving High-Performance Power Amplifier Linearization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9703217","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Achieving High-Performance Power Amplifier Linearization","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"RADAR-00-156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042598S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4250266","isNumber":"4250267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4250266","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4250267","articleId":"4250423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4250427,"authors":[{"name":"R.

One problem addressed is the severe lens distortion in low-cost cameras. For many computer vision algorithms aiming at reconstructing reliable representations of 3D scenes, the camera distortion effects will lead to inaccurate 3D reconstructions and geometrical measurements if not accounted for. A second problem is the color calibration problem caused by variations in camera responses that result in different color measurements and affects the algorithms that depend on these measurements. We also address the extrinsic camera calibration that estimates relative poses and orientations of multiple cameras in the system and the intrinsic camera calibration that estimates focal lengths and the skew parameters of the cameras. To address these calibration problems, we present multiview stereo techniques based on variational methods that utilize partial and ordinary differential equations. Our approach can also be considered as a coordinated refinement of camera calibration parameters. To reduce computational complexity of such algorithms, we utilize prior knowledge on the calibration object, making a piecewise smooth surface assumption, and evolve the pose, orientation, and scale parameters of such a 3D model object without requiring a 2D feature extraction from camera views. We derive the evolution equations for the distortion coefficients, the color calibration parameters, the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the cameras, and present experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4250455/04250460.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Variational Approach to Problems in Calibration of Multiple Cameras","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250460/","displayDocTitle":"A Variational Approach to Problems in Calibration of Multiple Cameras","volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9612620","pubMedId":"17568138","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250460/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variational Approach to Problems in Calibration of Multiple Cameras","sourcePdf":"i1322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076193S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4250455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4250455","articleId":"4250460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4250461,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav Y.

Methods for such imaging have traditionally used only a single light source per acquired image. They may result in images that are too dark and noisy, e.g., due to the need to avoid saturation of highlights. We introduce an approach that can significantly improve the quality of such images, in which multiple light sources illuminate the object simultaneously from different directions. These illumination-multiplexed frames are then computationally demultiplexed. The approach is useful for imaging dim objects, as well as objects having a specular reflection component. We give the optimal scheme by which lighting should be multiplexed to obtain the highest quality output, for signal-independent noise. The scheme is based on Hadamard codes. The consequences of imperfections such as stray light, saturation, and noisy illumination sources are then studied. In addition, the paper analyzes the implications of shot noise, which is signal-dependent, to Hadamard multiplexing. The approach facilitates practical lighting setups having high directional resolution. This is shown by a setup we devise, which is flexible, scalable, and programmable. We used it to demonstrate the benefit of multiplexing in experiments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250455","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4250455/04250461.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplexing for Optimal Lighting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4250461/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiplexing for Optimal Lighting","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9612621","pubMedId":"17568139","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplexing for Optimal Lighting","sourcePdf":"i1339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120937S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4250455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4250455","articleId":"4250461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4250466,"authors":[{"name":"Dariu M.

No feature correspondence is needed among exemplars, just a suitable pairwise similarity measure. The approach uses a template tree to efficiently represent and match the variety of shape exemplars. The tree is generated offline by a bottom-up clustering approach using stochastic optimization. Online matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the template tree and over the transformation parameters. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian model to estimate the a posteriori probability of the object class, after a certain match at a node of the tree. This model takes into account object scale and saliency and allows for a principled setting of the matching thresholds such that unpromising paths in the tree traversal process are eliminated early on. The proposed approach was tested in a variety of application domains. Here, results are presented on one of the more challenging domains: real-time pedestrian detection from a moving vehicle. A significant speed-up is obtained when comparing the proposed probabilistic matching approach with a manually tuned nonprobabilistic variant, both utilizing the same template tree structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9616498","htmlLink":"/document/4250466/","pubMedId":"17568144","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian, Exemplar-Based Approach to Hierarchical Shape Matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian, Exemplar-Based Approach to Hierarchical Shape Matching","sourcePdf":"i1408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059488S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4250455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"4250455","articleId":"4250466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4250467,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Keysers","affiliation":["Image Understanding and Pattern Recognition Group, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4250455/4250467/4250467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Keysers received the Dipl. degree (with honors) in 2000 and the Dr. degree (summa cum laude) in 2006, both in computer science, from the RWTH Aachen University, Germany.

The proposed framework utilizes tools from the duality theory of linear programming in order to provide an alternative and more general view of state-of-the-art techniques like the alpha-expansion algorithm, which is included merely as a special case. Moreover, contrary to alpha-expansion, the derived algorithms generate solutions with guaranteed optimality properties for a much wider class of problems, for example, even for MRFs with nonmetric potentials. In addition, they are capable of providing per-instance suboptimality bounds in all occasions, including discrete MRFs with an arbitrary potential function. These bounds prove to be very tight in practice (that is, very close to 1), which means that the resulting solutions are almost optimal. Our algorithms' effectiveness is demonstrated by presenting experimental results on a variety of low-level vision tasks, such as stereo matching, image restoration, image completion, and optical flow estimation, as well as on synthetic problems.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4250455/04250468.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4250455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Labeling via Graph Cuts Based on Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4250468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4250468/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Labeling via Graph Cuts Based on Linear Programming","volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9611757","pubMedId":"17568146","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4250468/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Labeling via Graph Cuts Based on Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"i1436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045616S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4250455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"157","articleId":"4250468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4250469,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghua Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4250455/4250469/4250469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianghua Xie received the MSc (with commendation) and PhD degrees in computer science in 2002 and 2006, respectively, from the University of Bristol, United Kingdom.

Spectral cognition of this form can also be used by regulators to facilitate the dynamic coexistence of different service types. An example of this is the operation of ultra-wideband devices in WiMAX bands: UWB devices must detect and avoid WiMAX devices in certain regulatory domains. In this article we start by discussing various options for detection and avoidance. We then describe the obstacles faced in achieving robust detection and avoidance with an on-chip implementation of basic DAA functionality. Finally, we present measurement results for operation of a single UWB device with a WiMAX system. This interaction also highlights the problem of dealing with listen before speak primaries where secondary transmission could interfere by blocking the primary's access to the medium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251073/","volume":"45","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251073/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9612579","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detect and avoid: an ultra-wideband/WiMAX coexistence mechanism [Topics in Radio Communications]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detect and avoid: an ultra-wideband/WiMAX coexistence mechanism [Topics in Radio Communications]","sourcePdf":"MISHRA.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037928S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4251056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4251056","articleId":"4251073","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4251074,"authors":[{"name":"John M.

There have been tremendous efforts in the design and experimentation of video-streaming systems in the past two decades; there have been no shortage of technical innovations, yet no single system has delivered the scale and service quality. The fundamental problem that throttles the large-scale deployment of Internet video streaming is the dissatisfaction end-users experience with performance. This is caused by a combination of many factors, such as the autonomous nature of the Internet, inherent instability, and lack of a service guarantee. This is further challenged by sustainable bandwidth and the stringent continuity requirements of streaming applications. Recent development of P2P-based streaming technology brings unprecedented new momentum to Internet video streaming, which has been shown to be cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. This article reviews the state-of-the-art P2P live video-streaming technologies and their development from a historic perspective. Based on our earlier success with a large-scale P2P streaming system, Coolstreaming, we summarize the main innovations and discuss the key trade offs in the system design. We present our observations on the future development and offer a few insights for further discussion.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2007.374425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4251056/04251077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2007.374425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251056","startPage":"94","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peer-to-peer live video streaming on the internet: issues, existing approaches, and challenges [Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Streaming]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peer-to-peer live video streaming on the internet: issues, existing approaches, and challenges [Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Streaming]","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621283","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4251077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peer-to-peer live video streaming on the internet: issues, existing approaches, and challenges [Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Streaming]","sourcePdf":"LI.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03247S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4251056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4251056","articleId":"4251077","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4251081,"authors":[{"name":"Sathya R.

Unlike previous studies, each user is assigned one spreading code to be employed on all of the transmit antennas, which poses a problem of data re-association at the receiver-end in the absence of prior information as to the channel state. Focusing on the differential Alamouti scheme, we propose a two-stage receive structure. The first stage performs a linear interference-blocking transformation, which allows user separation and inter-symbol interference (ISI) suppression. The second stage is, instead, a novel differential space-time block (STB) decoder suitable for frequency-selective channels. Interestingly, the proposed detector allows decoupling of the decisions on the transmitted symbols, while its blind implementation only requires a cubic (in the processing gain) complexity. A thorough performance assessment is undertaken to investigate, on one hand, the capability of acquiring the missing information, such as the system and the encoder timings, on the other hand, the interplay between the diversity gain provided by the MIMO structure of the communication system, and the additional co-channel interference that multiple transmit antennas produce in multi-path, multiple-access channels.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251150.pdf","startPage":"2066","endPage":"2075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Schemes for Asynchronous CDMA Systems on Dispersive MIMO Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Blind Schemes for Asynchronous CDMA Systems on Dispersive MIMO Channels","volume":"6","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9614139","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4251150/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251150/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Schemes for Asynchronous CDMA Systems on Dispersive MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092849S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4251153,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Horlin","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC), Wireless Research, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251153/4251153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francois Horlin was born in Bruxelles, Belgium, in 1975.

It enables the high capacity intrinsically offered by CDMA by making the equalization of the multipath channels and the mitigation of the resulting interference possible at a low complexity. This paper proposes a new air interface that combines SC-CDMA with space-time block coding (STBC) across multiple transmit antennas in order to make the link more robust. Contrary to existing air interfaces that perform the STBC at the chip level, making them only applicable to the downlink, the STBC is performed at the symbol level, making it also applicable to the uplink. In order to optimally detect the different antenna and user signals, a linear joint detector optimized according to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is designed. By exploiting the cyclic properties of the channel matrices, the complexity of the joint detector is significantly reduced. Furthermore, it is shown analytically that the inter-antenna interference is canceled out at the output of the first stage of the linear MMSE joint detector, consisting of a matched filter. By space-time coding the signal through two antennas at each transmit mobile terminal, a significant gain in signal-to-noise-ratio can be achieved. However, the spatial diversity gain of the proposed system is limited by the multiuser interference (MUI), that is increasing with the user load. Higher complexity non-linear receivers are needed to better compensate the MUI and still benefit from the spatial diversity at high user loads.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251153.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Block Coding for Uplink Single-Carrier CDMA with Joint Detection in the Frequency Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Block Coding for Uplink Single-Carrier CDMA with Joint Detection in the Frequency Domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621318","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4251153/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Block Coding for Uplink Single-Carrier CDMA with Joint Detection in the Frequency Domain","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100997S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4251154,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Zamiri-Jafarian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251154/4251154-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Zamiri-jafarian (M'98) was born in Mashhad, Iran, in 1960.

Due to multiple cochannel interferences in a MIMO system, the accuracy of channel estimation is a vital factor for proper receiver design in order to realize the full potential performance of the MIMO-OFDM system. A robust and improved channel estimation algorithm is proposed in this paper for MIMO-OFDM systems based on the least squares (LS) algorithm. The proposed algorithm, called improved LS (ILS), employs the noise correlation in order to reduce the variance of the LS estimation error by estimating and suppressing the noise in signal subspace. The performance of the ILS channel estimation algorithm is robust to the number of antennas in transmit and receive sides. The new algorithm attains a significant improvement in performance in comparison with that of the regular LS estimator. Also, with respect to mean square error criterion and without using channel statistics, the ILS algorithm achieves a performance very close to that of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator in terms of the parameters used in practical MIMO-OFDM systems. A modification of the ILS algorithm, called modified ILS (MILS), is proposed based on using the second order statistical parameters of channel. Analytically, it is shown that the MILS estimator achieves the exact performance of the MMSE estimator. Due to no specific data sequences being required to perform the estimation, in addition to the training mode, the proposed channel estimation algorithms can also be extended and used in the tracking mode with decision-aided method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251154.pdf","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Noise robustness","Noise reduction","Mean square error methods","Dispersion","Frequency domain analysis","Interference","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cochannel interference","dispersive channels","interference suppression","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation algorithm","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","wireless transmission system","dispersive channel","multiple cochannel interferences","improved least squares algorithm","noise suppression","minimum mean square error estimator","second order statistical channel parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251154/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9687085","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078896S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4251156,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Q.

This paper provides a unified performance analysis of various TR schemes by developing an analytical framework based on the sampling expansion approach. Specifically, we derive the uncoded bit error probability (BEP) of different TR signaling schemes, including TR and differential TR (DTR) signaling valid for a broad class of fading channels. We consider both AcRs and modified AcRs with noise averaging. We further develop a quasi-analytical method as well as an approximate analytical method to extend the BEP analysis to include the effect of narrowband interference (NBI). We show that the approximate analytical method is particularly useful in obtaining BEP expressions that provide insight into the effect of NBI. We quantify the effects of NBI and channel power dispersion profile on the optimum integration interval of an AcR. Finally, we compare TR and DTR signaling in terms of their sensitivity to NBI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251156.pdf","startPage":"2126","endPage":"2139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Analysis of UWB Transmitted-Reference Schemes in the Presence of Narrowband Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference","Performance analysis","Autocorrelation","RAKE receivers","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Error probability","Fading","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","interference (signal)","spread spectrum communication","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB transmitted-reference schemes","narrowband interference","autocorrelation receiver","Rake reception","ultrawide bandwidth systems","sampling expansion approach","bit error probability","fading channels","channel power dispersion profile"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Unified Analysis of UWB Transmitted-Reference Schemes in the Presence of Narrowband Interference","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251156/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9612596","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Analysis of UWB Transmitted-Reference Schemes in the Presence of Narrowband Interference","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179509S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4251159,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Ping Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251159/4251159-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Ping Liu was born in Tainan, Taiwan.

Besides considering the standard, we also propose and study system performance enhancements through the application of Turbo and Repeat-Accumulate (RA) codes, as well as OFDM bit-loading. Our methodology consists of (a) a study of the channel model developed under IEEE 802.15 for UWB from a frequency-domain perspective suited for OFDM transmission, (b) development and quantification of appropriate information-theoretic performance measures, (c) comparison of these measures with simulation results for the Multiband OFDM standard proposal as well as our proposed extensions, and (d) the consideration of the influence of practical, imperfect channel estimation on the performance. We find that the current Multiband OFDM standard sufficiently exploits the frequency selectivity of the UWB channel, and that the system performs in the vicinity of the channel cutoff rate. Turbo codes and a reduced-complexity clustered bit-loading algorithm improve the system power efficiency by over 6 dB at a data rate of 480 Mbps.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","startPage":"2182","endPage":"2192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Enhancement of Multiband OFDM for UWB Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Enhancement of Multiband OFDM for UWB Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9654338","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4251161/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Enhancement of Multiband OFDM for UWB Communications","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061076S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4251162,"authors":[{"name":"Peter W.C.

In single-cell scenario, while MC-CDMA is good at achieving frequency diversity when there is no channel state information available at the transmit side (CSIT), OFDMA achieves higher capacity than MC-CDMA due to its finer resolution in exploiting multiuser diversity with CSIT. Whether multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) MC-CDMA or OFDMA is a better option in multi-cell system remains unjustified in the literature. In this paper, we study the ergodic capacity and the goodput of MIMO-MC-CDMA and MIMO-OFDMA downlink systems with CSIT in multi-cell scenario assuming that the base station has the knowledge of the average inter-cell interference level only. Several types of users modeling different interference patterns are considered: (I) high data rate delay-insensitive users, (II) high data rate delay-sensitive .users, and (III) voice users (low data rate and bursty). Optimal resource allocation algorithms are used to compute the capacities of the systems, while a simple heuristic is used to obtain the achievable goodputs for both systems. The effects of path loss, number of antennas and different user types are studied and insightful results are obtained. We find that OFDMA has a higher system goodput for both Type I and Type II high data rate users, while MC-CDMA has a higher goodput for Type III users. Compared to MC-CDMA, the goodput of an OFDMA system is more sensitive to the activity factor of the voice users and suffers from noticeable loss. This demonstrates the superiority of the two systems in different practical situations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Downlink Multiuser MIMO-OFDMA and MIMO-MC-CDMA with Transmit Side Information - Multi-Cell Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251162.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Downlink Multiuser MIMO-OFDMA and MIMO-MC-CDMA with Transmit Side Information - Multi-Cell Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251162/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621320","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Downlink Multiuser MIMO-OFDMA and MIMO-MC-CDMA with Transmit Side Information - Multi-Cell Analysis","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076779S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4251163,"authors":[{"name":"Ghurumuruhan Ganesan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251163/4251163-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ghurumuruhan Ganesan received his B.

We show that by allowing the cognitive users operating in the same band to cooperate we can reduce the detection time and thus increase the overall agility. We first consider a two-user cognitive radio network and show how the inherent asymmetry in the network can be exploited to increase the agility. We show that our cooperation scheme increases the agility of the cognitive users by as much as 35%. We then extend our cooperation scheme to multicarrier networks with two users per carrier and analyze asymptotic agility gain. In Part II of our paper [1], we investigate multiuser single carrier networks.

We present a series of iterative and non-iterative receivers in which complexity is traded for performance. In particular, a high complexity non-iterative receiver that achieves the theoretically lowest BER and a low complexity iterative receiver that show near-optimal performance are presented. The proposed iterative receiver offers a 50 - 98% reduction in complexity over a non- iterative receiver having equivalent performance, depending on the modulation used. We observe that the performance of the receiver is independent of the channel's Doppler frequency and delay spread.

We use Shannon-theoretic tools to analyze the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the power-bandwidth tradeoff) in meaningful asymptotic regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and network size. We design linear distributed multi-antenna relay beamforming (LDMRB) schemes that exploit the spatial signature of multi-user interference and characterize their power-bandwidth tradeoff under a system-wide power constraint on source and relay transmissions. The impact of multiple users, multiple relays and multiple antennas on the key performance measures of the high and low SNR regimes is investigated in order to shed new light on the possible reduction in power and bandwidth requirements through the usage of such practical relay cooperation techniques. Our results indicate that point-to-point coded multi-user networks supported by distributed relay beamforming techniques yield enhanced energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, and with appropriate signaling and sufficient antenna degrees of freedom, can achieve asymptotically optimal power-bandwidth tradeoff with the best possible (i.e., as in the cutset bound) energy scaling of K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n and the best possible spectral efficiency slope at any SNR for large number of relay terminals. Furthermore, our results help to identify the role of interference cancellation capability at the relay terminals on realizing the optimal power- bandwidth tradeoff; and show how relaying schemes that do not attempt to mitigate multi-user interference, despite their optimal capacity scaling performance, could yield a poor power- bandwidth tradeoff.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","volume":"6","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9612598","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4251171/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Dense Multi-Antenna Relay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Dense Multi-Antenna Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136595S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4251174,"authors":[{"name":"Besma Smida","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251174/4251174-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Besma Smida (S98-M06) received the Diplome d'Jngenieur degree in telecommunications from Ecole Superieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia, in 1995 and the M.

First, we derive a new post-correlation model for MC-CDMA that characterizes the structure of the channel in space, time and frequency. Based on this model, we introduce a new multi-carrier array-receiver with rapid and accurate joint synchronization in time and frequency. There, we exploit jointly the spatial, temporal and frequency diversities as well as the intrinsic inter-carrier correlation (termed hereafter frequency gain) to improve the channel identification and the synchronization operations. In addition, based on a new link/system-level performance analysis, with a band-limited chip waveform assumption, we provide a comparative performance study of MC-STAR over two multi-carrier CDMA air-interface configurations, namely MT-CDMA and MC-DS-CDMA, in the most realistic operating conditions. Link/system-level results confirm the advantages of MT-CDMA in increasing throughput and bandwidth efficiency. The current trend is to design radio air-interfaces with flat fading subcarriers. In contrast, with MC-STAR we show that the positive effects of multipath diversity and frequency gain over large strongly-overlapping subcarriers is more significant than the negative effects of multipath and multi-carrier interference.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency synchronization","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Frequency diversity","Transceivers","Bandwidth","Interference","Frequency conversion","Wireless communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","correlation theory","receivers","synchronisation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier CDMA array-receiver","diversity-based enhanced time and frequency synchronization","spectrum-efficient spatiotemporal array-receiver","multicarrier CDMA systems","MC-STAR","post-correlation model","channel identification","multipath interference","multicarrier interference","antenna arrays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251174","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05842","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251174.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05842","startPage":"2315","endPage":"2327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrum-Efficient Multicarrier CDMA Array-Receiver with Diversity-Based Enhanced Time and Frequency Synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrum-Efficient Multicarrier CDMA Array-Receiver with Diversity-Based Enhanced Time and Frequency Synchronization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251174/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251174/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621327","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrum-Efficient Multicarrier CDMA Array-Receiver with Diversity-Based Enhanced Time and Frequency Synchronization","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095024S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4251175,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251175/4251175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bor-Sen Chen (M'82-SM'89-F'01) received the B.S. degree from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taiwan, the M.S. degree from National Central University, Taiwan, and the Ph.D degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1970, 1973, and 1982, respectively.

In this study, several possible channel models of MC-CDMA systems are considered as a multi-state switching Markov process to match the time-varying multipath fading channel. A novel multiple channel estimator, which consists of several possible channel models and can be self-adjusted to fit different channel uncertain conditions, is proposed for MC-CDMA systems to effectively estimate channel coefficients in the frequency domain over time-varying multipath fading channels. Based on the proposed channel estimation, an enhanced minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer is employed for symbol detection of MC-CDMA systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multiple channel estimator can track the channel more accurately than the conventional channel estimators. With the consideration of channel estimation error as a channel noise to improve symbol detection, the enhanced equalizer based on the proposed multiple channel estimator performs much better than those based on the conventional channel estimators in bit error rate (BER).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251175.pdf","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MC-CDMA Multiple Channel Estimation and Tracking Over Time-Varying Multipath Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Channel estimation","Fading","Time varying systems","Frequency estimation","Equalizers","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","equalisers","error statistics","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","Markov processes","spread spectrum communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MC-CDMA multiple channel estimation","time-varying multipath fading channels","multicarrier code-division multiple access","direct-sequence spread spectrum techniques","multi-state switching Markov process","frequency domain","minimum mean-square error","MMSE equalizer","symbol detection","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MC-CDMA Multiple Channel Estimation and Tracking Over Time-Varying Multipath Fading Channels","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251175/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9614143","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MC-CDMA Multiple Channel Estimation and Tracking Over Time-Varying Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106834S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4251176,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251176/4251176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiao-Hwa Chen is currently a full Professor at National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan.

The analysis takes into account almost all real operational conditions, such as asynchronous transmissions, RAKE receiver, multiple access interference (MAI), multipath interference (MI), log-normal shadowing, and noise. The main objective of the paper is to reveal the relationship between time domain characteristics of pulse waveforms and BER of a UWB radio. It is shown through analysis (also validated by simulation) that the normalized mean squared auto-correlation function (ACF) of the pulse waveforms can be used as an effective merit figure to judge the suitability for their applications in a DS-CDMA UWB radio. In fact, the normalized mean squared auto-correlation function (ACF) governs the average inter-chip interference caused by imperfect auto-correlation function of the pulse waveforms. The paper concludes that, as long as the power spectral density (PSD) functions of the pulse waveforms fit the FCC spectral mask, the pulse waveforms' normalized mean squared ACF should be minimized to ensure an acceptable BER.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251176.pdf","startPage":"2338","endPage":"2347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse Waveform Dependent BER Analysis of a DS-CDMA UWB Radio Under Multiple Access and Multipath Interferences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251176/","displayDocTitle":"Pulse Waveform Dependent BER Analysis of a DS-CDMA UWB Radio Under Multiple Access and Multipath Interferences","volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621328","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4251176/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse Waveform Dependent BER Analysis of a DS-CDMA UWB Radio Under Multiple Access and Multipath Interferences","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064008S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4251177,"authors":[{"name":"Chirag S.

The mobile relays either decode and forward (DF) or amplify and forward (AF) the received signal. Most existing analyses of cooperation diversity assumes perfect channel information at the receiver. A realistic assessment should consider the effects of practical channel estimation schemes. This paper considers pilot symbol aided channel estimation for cooperation diversity systems. Since the overall channel in AF systems is different from conventional cellular channels, the channel estimation problem is interesting and challenging and therefore our focus is on AF systems. The paper addresses issues such as the estimator design, pilot symbol spacing based upon realistic channel models, and an approximate bit error rate (BER) analysis that accounts for imperfect channel estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251177.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Amplify and Forward Relay Based Cooperation Diversity Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Diversity reception","Decoding","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Bit error rate","Collaborative work","Government","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","diversity reception","error statistics","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-forward relay based cooperation diversity system","cellular networks","base station","mobile relays","pilot symbol aided channel estimation","AF systems","pilot symbol spacing","bit error rate analysis","destination receiver","DF relays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Amplify and Forward Relay Based Cooperation Diversity Systems","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4251177/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9614144","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for Amplify and Forward Relay Based Cooperation Diversity Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078982S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4251178,"authors":[{"name":"Keivan Navaie","affiliation":["Broadband Communications and Wireless Systems (BCWS) Center, Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4251134/4251178/4251178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keivan Navaie (S'02-M'05) received his B.

We use a fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) model in an appropriate time-scale to represent the self-similarity in the downlink interference. The estimated interference is utilized to allocate the available power to non-real-time services. In doing so, we use a utility-based optimization scheme and dynamic programming for time-domain optimal scheduling of non-real-time traffic. Simulation results validate the fGn model and show a substantial improvement in the delay fairness and a significant increase in the average cell throughput using our proposed scheme; and confirm that the interference model is valid for a broad range of arrival rates of non-real time traffic.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2007.05877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4251134/04251178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2007.05877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4251134","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Model-Based Non-Real-Time Downlink Data Transmission in Heterogeneous DS-CDMA Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4251178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Model-Based Non-Real-Time Downlink Data Transmission in Heterogeneous DS-CDMA Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4251178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9611740","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4251178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Model-Based Non-Real-Time Downlink Data Transmission in Heterogeneous DS-CDMA Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0706_2357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074025S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4251134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4251134","articleId":"4251178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4252104,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Sala","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Control (DISA), Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Sala","id":"37272874200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4252104","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252104","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Communication system control","Actuators","State feedback","Computer networks","DC motors","Control systems","Application software","Hardware","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","digital control","linear matrix inequalities","sampled data systems","sampling methods","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-rate variations","generalized hold functions","actuator devices","generalized sample","state feedback controllers","multitasking","networked computer control environments","linear matrix inequality","DC motor setup"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control","irregular sampling","missing data","real-time systems","sample and hold circuits","sampled data systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the use of actuator devices implementing the so-called generalized sample and hold functions.

When static obstacles popup during the flight, the UAVs are required to steer around them and also avoid collisions between each other. In order to achieve these goals, a new dual-mode control strategy is proposed: a \"safe mode\" is defined as an operation in an obstacle-free environment and a \"danger mode\" is activated when there is a chance of collision or when there are obstacles in the path. Safe mode achieves global optimization because the dynamics of all the UAVs participating in the formation are taken into account in the controller formulation. In the danger mode, a novel algorithm using a modified Grossberg neural network (GNN) is proposed for obstacle/collision avoidance. This decentralized algorithm in 2-D uses the geometry of the flight space to generate optimal/suboptimal trajectories. Extension of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance in a 3-D environment is shown. In order to handle practical vehicle constraints, a model predictive control-based tracking controller is used to track the references generated. Numerical results are provided to motivate this approach and to demonstrate its potential.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Collision avoidance","Predictive models","Radar tracking","Neural networks","Predictive control","Nuclear power generation","Vehicle dynamics","Geometry","Fires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","collision avoidance","geometry","mobile robots","navigation","neurocontrollers","predictive control","remotely operated vehicles","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking controller","model predictive control","vehicle constraints","flight space geometry","decentralized algorithm","modified Grossberg neural network","global optimization","danger mode","safe mode","dual-mode control strategy","navigation problems","collision avoidance","obstacle avoidance","cooperative UAV formation flying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collision avoidance","cooperative control","Grossberg neural network (GNN)","model predictive control (MPC)","obstacle avoidance","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","visibility graph"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252107","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2007.899191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4252088/04252107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2007.899191","startPage":"672","endPage":"679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative UAV Formation Flying With Obstacle/Collision Avoidance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative UAV Formation Flying With Obstacle/Collision Avoidance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252107/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4252107/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596747","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative UAV Formation Flying With Obstacle/Collision Avoidance","sourcePdf":"15tcst04-wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053825S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4252088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"4252088","articleId":"4252107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252114,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In the RS decoder, the implicit redundancy of the received codeword, under suitable assumptions explained in this paper, allows implementing concurrent error detection schemes useful for a wide range of different decoding algorithms with no intervention on the decoder architecture. Moreover, performances in terms of area and delay overhead for the proposed circuits are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4252112/04252114.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection in Reed\u2013Solomon Encoders and Decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Circuit faults","Error correction codes","Galois fields","Redundancy","Polynomials","Arithmetic","Fault detection","Delay","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic codes","decoding","error correction codes","error detection codes","fault tolerance","Galois fields","logic circuits","logic design","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent error detection","self-checking Reed-Solomon encoder architecture","self-checking Reed-Solomon decoder architecture","RS codes","arithmetic operations","binary representation","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction coding","fault tolerance","Reed\u2013Solomon codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection in Reed\u2013Solomon Encoders and Decoders","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4252114/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598946","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Error Detection in Reed\u2013Solomon Encoders and Decoders","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi07-cardarilli-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073991S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4252112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4252112","articleId":"4252114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252122,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Ping Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4252112/4252122/4252122-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Ping Lin received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in computer information science from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2000 and 2002, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering.","He is currently working in the areas of test-set compression/decompression, low power testing, delay testing, and SoC testing.

To achieve high compression in conjunction with reducing test power for multiple-scan-chain designs is even harder and very few works were dedicated to solve this problem. This paper proposes and demonstrates a multilayer data copy (MDC) scheme for test compression as well as test power reduction for multiple-scan-chain designs. The scheme utilizes a decoding buffer, which supports fast loading using previous loaded data, to achieve test data compression and test power reduction at the same time. The scheme can be applied automatic test pattern generation (ATPG)-independently or to be incorporated in an ATPG to generate highly compressible and power efficient test sets. Experiment results on benchmarks show that test sets generated by the scheme had large compression and power saving with only a small area design overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4252112/04252122.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multilayer Data Copy Test Data Compression Scheme for Reducing Shifting-in Power for Multiple Scan Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Test data compression","Circuit testing","Automatic test pattern generation","Test pattern generators","Automatic testing","System testing","System-on-a-chip","Power generation","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","circuit testing","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer data copy test data compression","shifting-in power reduction","multiple scan design","decoding buffer","test power reduction","automatic test pattern generation","circuit testing","low-power testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit testing","low-power testing","test data compression","test pattern generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multilayer Data Copy Test Data Compression Scheme for Reducing Shifting-in Power for Multiple Scan Design","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4252122/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598947","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multilayer Data Copy Test Data Compression Scheme for Reducing Shifting-in Power for Multiple Scan Design","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi07-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090816S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4252112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4252112","articleId":"4252122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4252124,"authors":[{"name":"Myoung-Cheol Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company, Giheung, Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Myoung-Cheol","lastName":"Shin","id":"37340119200"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4252124","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Hardware","Interleaved codes","Software performance","Wireless communication","Communication standards","Computer architecture","Software algorithms","Timing","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","block codes","code division multiple access","decoding","interleaved codes","telecommunication standards","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size 0.25 mum","CMOS","cdma2000 standard turbo codes","W-CDMA","block interleaving algorithm","single-instruction multiple- data processor","SISO decoder","soft-input-soft-output decoder","multiple third-generation wireless communication standard","programmable turbo decoder","SIMD processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cdma2000","parallel algorithm","turbo code","turbo interleaver","W-CDMA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252124","abstract":"A programmable turbo decoder is designed to support multiple third-generation wireless communication standards.

The proposed BIST TPG decreases transitions that occur at scan inputs during scan shift operations and hence reduces switching activity in the CUT. The proposed BIST is comprised of two TPGs: LT-RTPG and 3-weight WRBIST. Test patterns generated by the LT-RTPG detect easy-to-detect faults and test patterns generated by the 3-weight WRBIST detect faults that remain undetected after LT-RTPG patterns are applied. The proposed BIST TPG does not require modification of mission logics, which can lead to performance degradation. Experimental results for ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed BIST can significantly reduce switching activity during BIST while achieving 100% fault coverage for all ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits. Larger reduction in switching activity is achieved in large circuits. Experimental results also show that the proposed BIST can be implemented with low area overhead.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899234","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.899234","startPage":"777","endPage":"789","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4252112/04252129.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252129/","displayDocTitle":"A BIST TPG for Low Power Dissipation and High Fault Coverage","volume":"15","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"9596751","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252129/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BIST TPG for Low Power Dissipation and High Fault Coverage","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi07-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115467S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4252112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4252112","articleId":"4252129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4252135,"authors":[{"name":"Yixue Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yixue","lastName":"Du","id":"37277585800"},{"name":"Jing Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277630300"},{"name":"S.

Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level. This study demonstrates the ability to perform closed-loop control and steering of a flexible needle by maneuvering the needle base so that its tip achieves a planned trajectory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252165/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9596742","volume":"23","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Image-Guided Robotic Flexible Needle Steering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image-Guided Robotic Flexible Needle Steering","sourcePdf":"23tro03-glozman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055168S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4252154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"4252154","articleId":"4252165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252168,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungno Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4252154/4252168/4252168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyungno Lee received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1998 and 2007.","His current research interests are haptic control and rendering for virtual-reality-based simulation."]},"firstName":"Kyungno","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293704500"},{"name":"Doo Yong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4252154/4252168/4252168-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Doo Yong Lee (S'89\u2013M'93\u2013SM'99) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.","He has been on the faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, since 1994, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Haptic systems employ physics-based deformation models such as finite-element models and mass-spring models. These physics-based deformation models for high fidelity have to deal with complex geometries, material properties, and realistic behavior of virtual objects. This incurs heavy computational burden and time delays so that the reflective force often cannot be computed at 1 kHz which is a safe frequency for stability of the haptic systems. Lower update rates of the haptic loop and the computational time delay also deteriorate the realism of the haptic system. This problem is resolved by the proposed MIMO output-estimation method. The haptic system is designed to have two sampling times, T and JT, for the haptic loop and the graphic loop, respectively. Dynamics of the physics-based deformation is captured in a discrete and deterministic input-output model. The MIMO output estimation method is developed drawing on a least-squares algorithm and an output-error estimation model. The P-matrix resetting algorithm is also designed to deal with the changing input-output relationship of the deformation model. The parameters of the discrete input-output model are adjusted online. Intersample outputs are computed from the estimated input-output model at a high rate, and traces the correct output computed from the deformation model. This method enables graphics rendering at a lower update rate, and haptic rendering at a higher update rate. Convergence of the proposed method is proved, and performance is demonstrated through simulation with both a linear tensor-mass and a linear mass-spring models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO

pendulums (MWPs). Robots pertaining to this class are composed of two wheels rotating about a central body. The main feature of MWP pertains to the central body, which can rotate about the wheel axis. As such motion is undesirable, the problem of the stabilization of the central body in an MWP is crucial. The novelty of the work reported here resides in the construction of: 1) the system controllability Lie algebra for the purpose of a rigorous controllability analysis and the computation of the largest feedback-linearizable subsystem; 2) a controller by input-output linearization of the system for achieving the desired steering rate of the robot while stabilizing the central body; 3) a controller based on the internal properties of the system to achieve the desired heading velocity of the robot; and 4) a controller based on the sliding-mode approach for controlling both the position and the orientation of the robot. The entire control structure that permits full control of the robot posture comprises three imbricated loops. Simulations showing good performance of the controlled system are provided. Preliminary tests performed on an experimental platform confirm the validity of the controller.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.898953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.898953","startPage":"564","endPage":"577","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4252154/04252174.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllability and Posture Control of a Wheeled Pendulum Moving on an Inclined Plane","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Controllability and Posture Control of a Wheeled Pendulum Moving on an Inclined Plane","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252174/","accessionNumber":"9597560","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252174/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllability and Posture Control of a Wheeled Pendulum Moving on an Inclined Plane","sourcePdf":"23tro03-nasrallah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086708S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4252154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4252154","articleId":"4252174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252175,"authors":[{"name":"Derek R.

It is assumed that the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. A new adaptive algorithm is developed to estimate the unknown parameters online, based on three original ideas. First, we use the pseudoinverse of the depth-independent interaction matrix to map the image errors onto the joint space of the manipulator. By eliminating the depths in the interaction matrix, we can linearly parameterize the closed-loop dynamics of the manipulator. Second, to guarantee the existence of the pseudoinverse, the adaptive algorithm introduces a potential force to drive the estimated parameters away from the values that result in a singular Jacobian matrix. Third, to ensure that the estimated parameters are convergent to their true values up to a scale, we combine the Slotine-Li method with an online algorithm for minimizing the error between the estimated projections and real image coordinates of the feature points. We have proved asymptotic convergence of the image errors to zero by the Lyapunov theory based on the nonlinear robot dynamics. Experiments have been carried out to verify the performance of the proposed controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Visual Tracking for Manipulators Using an Uncalibrated Fixed Camera","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.895091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4252154/04252182.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.895091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Visual Tracking for Manipulators Using an Uncalibrated Fixed Camera","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4252182/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9596745","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Visual Tracking for Manipulators Using an Uncalibrated Fixed Camera","sourcePdf":"23tro03-wang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072328S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4252154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4252154","articleId":"4252182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252184,"authors":[{"name":"Anant Agarwal","affiliation":["Cree Research, Inc., Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273299700"},{"name":"Husna Fatima","affiliation":["Cree Research, Inc., Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Husna","lastName":"Fatima","id":"37271099600"},{"name":"Sarah Haney","affiliation":["Cree Research, Inc., Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Haney","id":"37408668200"},{"name":"Sei-Hyung Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sei-Hyung","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37274277600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4252184","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"The phenomenon of recombination-induced stacking faults in high-voltage p-n diodes in SiC has been previously shown to increase the forward voltage drop due to reduction of minority carrier lifetime.

If the internal body diode is allowed to be forward biased during the operation of these devices, then the recombination-induced SFs will reduce the majority carrier conduction current and increase the leakage current in blocking mode.

In our previous work, siphons in a Petri net are divided into elementary and dependent ones on the condition that all emptiable minimal siphons are computed. In this research, a mixed integer programming (MlP)-based deadlock detection technique is used to find some, in general not all, minimal siphons in a plant model without complete siphon enumeration. For each siphon found, depending on its noncontrollability, a monitor is added such that it is invariant-controlled. Our siphon control method guarantees that no emptiable control-induced siphon is generated due to the addition of the monitors. The siphon control process proceeds iteratively until there is no unmarked siphon in the supervisor of a plant model. Compared with the existing approaches, the novel deadlock prevention policy can usually lead to a structurally simple liveness-enforcing supervisor by adding only a small number of monitors and arcs. More importantly, complete siphon enumeration is avoided. A practical flexible manufacturing system (FMS) example is utilized to illustrate the proposed methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2007.897333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4252232/04252253.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2007.897333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Liveness-Enforcing Supervisors for Flexible Manufacturing Systems Using Petri Nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Liveness-Enforcing Supervisors for Flexible Manufacturing Systems Using Petri Nets","volume":"37","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4252253/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9831972","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Liveness-Enforcing Supervisors for Flexible Manufacturing Systems Using Petri Nets","sourcePdf":"37tsmcc04-li2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18413S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4252232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4252232","articleId":"4252253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252262,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Yao","affiliation":["Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Yao","id":"37691896700"},{"name":"Thomas Edmunds","affiliation":["Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Edmunds","id":"37700144600"},{"name":"Dimitri Papageorgiou","affiliation":["University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Papageorgiou","id":"38181174600"},{"name":"Rogelio Alvarez","affiliation":["Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rogelio","lastName":"Alvarez","id":"37702029700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-6977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2442"}],"articleNumber":"4252262","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1057},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252262","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Terrorism","Power generation economics","Costs","Surveillance","Switches","Laboratories","Testing","Natural gas","Asset management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","power system economics","power system security","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trilevel optimization","power network defense","resource allocation","terrorist attacks","economic cost","decomposition approach","bilevel optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Homeland security","interdiction","multilevel optimization","network defense"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2007.897487","endPage":"718","startPage":"712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4252232/04252262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2007.897487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trilevel Optimization in Power Network Defense","abstract":"We present a trilevel optimization model of resource allocation in electric power network defense.

From the electromechanical point of view, their behavior is characterized by the torque-to-speed curve and the mechanical impedance. In this paper, we report an investigation of the electromechanical behavior of eddy-current dampers/couplers consisting of permanent magnets and a massive conductor. Our goal was to determine the influence of the main design parameters on the torque-to-speed characteristic and on the mechanical impedance. To this end, we studied the dependence of the electrical pole and static damping coefficient on the design parameters under a given current density distribution within the conductor. This approach is equivalent to the procedure used to characterize the inductance and the torque constant of a standard electrical machine and it allows us to show that the electrical pole is determined by the inductive and resistive nature of the conductive part. Even if the conductor is realized by a solid conductor, the approach allows us to determine its equivalent resistance and inductance as a function of the design parameters, such as the number of pole pairs and the thicknesses of the permanent magnets and the conductor. We validated the analytical expressions of the equivalent lumped parameters, of the electrical pole, and of the static damping coefficient by finite-element analysis. This analysis provides the guidelines to identify the project parameters that can be varied to optimize the performances of the device as a coupler, damper, or brake.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Damping","Magnetic analysis","Impedance","Shock absorbers","Couplers","Permanent magnets","Inductance","Vibration control","Current density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current density","current distribution","eddy currents","finite element analysis","permanent magnets","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-element analysis","equivalent lumped parameters","equivalent inductance","equivalent resistance","current density distribution","static damping","electrical pole","torque-to-speed characteristic","massive conductor","permanent magnets","eddy-current dampers-couplers","mechanical impedance","vibrations semi-active control","design parameters sensitivity","torsional eddy-current dampers","dynamic behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Damper","dynamic behavior","eddy current"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.894560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4252275/04252278.pdf","startPage":"3266","endPage":"3277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.894560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Behavior of Torsional Eddy-Current Dampers: Sensitivity of the Design Parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Behavior of Torsional Eddy-Current Dampers: Sensitivity of the Design Parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252278/","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252278/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9600542","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Behavior of Torsional Eddy-Current Dampers: Sensitivity of the Design Parameters","sourcePdf":"43tmag07-canova.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071743S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4252275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4252275","articleId":"4252278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252288,"authors":[{"name":"Fausto Fiorillo","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Fausto Fiorillo was born in Bricherasio, Italy, in 1947.

The approach is based on a systematic comparison of the results obtained by this method with those from the conventional closed-circuit and open-sample methods and on the assessment of the dynamic phenomena engendered by the application of the fast exciting field pulse. Such phenomena derive from the thermal fluctuation after effect and the eddy currents, whose contributions to hysteresis loop swelling are brought to light and separately evaluated. We show that the quasi-static hysteresis loop can be retrieved from the dynamically obtained one by compensating for the magnetic viscosity field, found to be proportional to the coercive field, and the eddy-current counterfield. A simple analytical formulation accounts for and predicts the effect of the counterfield.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4252275/04252288.pdf","startPage":"3159","endPage":"3164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.893536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.893536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the Hysteresis Loop of Permanent Magnets With the Pulsed Field Magnetometer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Permanent magnets","Magnetometers","Magnetic hysteresis","Fluctuations","Eddy currents","Magnetic separation","Viscosity","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coercive force","eddy currents","magnetic aftereffect","magnetic hysteresis","magnetometers","permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coercive field","magnetic viscosity","eddy currents","thermal fluctuation aftereffect","closed-circuit method","pulsed field magnetometer","permanent magnets","hysteresis loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic hysteresis loop","magnetic measurements","permanent magnets","pulsed field magnetometer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the Hysteresis Loop of Permanent Magnets With the Pulsed Field Magnetometer","volume":"43","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4252288/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596721","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the Hysteresis Loop of Permanent Magnets With the Pulsed Field Magnetometer","sourcePdf":"43tmag07-fiorillo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080423S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4252275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4252275","articleId":"4252288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252292,"authors":[{"name":"Andries P.

Successive revolutions of the meta-spiral are separated by a narrow guard band. For high storage densities, such a system results in severe 2-D inter-symbol interference. In the multi-track Viterbi algorithm (MVA) of Krishnamoorthi and Weeks, the complex problem of 2-D bit-detection is broken down into a number of smaller bit-detection problems on sets of adjacent bit-rows called stripes. We improve the bit error rate (bER) performance of such a 2-D bit-detector via a number of measures such as: 1) weighing of the separate contributions to the branch metrics from each bit-row in a stripe and 2) inclusion of an additional contribution to the branch metrics from a bit-row adjacent to a stripe. In addition, we reduce the computational complexity by varying the number of bit-rows per stripe during successive iterations of the MVA, and through the use of local sequence feedback.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.897665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4252275/04252292.pdf","startPage":"3333","endPage":"3339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.897665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refinements of Multi-Track Viterbi Bit-Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252292/","displayDocTitle":"Refinements of Multi-Track Viterbi Bit-Detection","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9597539","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252292/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refinements of Multi-Track Viterbi Bit-Detection","sourcePdf":"43tmag07-hekstra.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077881S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4252275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4252275","articleId":"4252292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4252298,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The rotor position estimating techniques are used in a high-performance sensorless variable speed SRM drive. A digital signal processor, TMS320F2812, executes the rotor position estimation. To verify the performance of the ANN and ANFIS based rotor position estimation techniques, a rotor position sensor is mounted with the drive system.

The carrier-less nature of this nonconventional totally real transmission technique necessitates the construction of new suitable coding schemes. In fact, the last generation of complex-valued ST codes (namely, the perfect codes) cannot be associated with IR-UWB systems where the phase reconstitution at the receiver side is practically infeasible. On the other hand, while the perfect codes were considered mainly with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and hexagonal (HEX) constellations, IR-UWB systems are often associated with pulse-position modulation (PPM) and hybrid PPM-PAM (pulse-amplitude modulation) constellations. In this paper, instead of adopting the classical approach of constructing ST codes over infinite fields or for the perfect codes), we study the possibility of constructing modulation-specific codes that are exclusive to PPM and PPM-PAM. The proposed full-rate codes are totally real, information lossless, and have a uniform average energy per transmit antenna. They permit to achieve a full diversity order with any number of transmit antennas. In some situations, the proposed schemes have an optimal nonvanishing coding gain and satisfy all the construction constraints of the perfect codes in addition to the constraint of being totally real. Simulations performed over realistic indoor UWB channels showed that the proposed schemes outperform the best known codes constructed from cyclic division algebras.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.899472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4252316/04252317.pdf","startPage":"2490","endPage":"2509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.899472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Space\u2013Time Coding With Pulse Position and Amplitude Modulations for Time-Hopping Ultra-Wideband Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"On Space\u2013Time Coding With Pulse Position and Amplitude Modulations for Time-Hopping Ultra-Wideband Systems","volume":"53","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598901","htmlLink":"/document/4252317/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Space\u2013Time Coding With Pulse Position and Amplitude Modulations for Time-Hopping Ultra-Wideband Systems","sourcePdf":"53tit07-abourjeily.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102994S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4252316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4252316","articleId":"4252317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252322,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Chakraborty","affiliation":["California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37326046100"},{"name":"Prakash Narayan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Narayan","id":"37274551800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4252322","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical refraction","Optical variables control","Optical fiber communication","Space technology","Channel capacity","Communication system security","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","intensity modulation","optical receivers","photodetectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel state information","multiplicative fading","transmitted signal","photodetector receiver","intensity modulation","optical beam","information signal","single-input single-output","Poisson fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","channel state information","coherence time","free-space optical communication","lognormal fading","Poisson fading channel","single input single output"]}],"abstract":"In this first paper of a two-part series, a single-user single-input single-output (SISO) shot-noise-limited Poisson channel is considered over which an information signal is transmitted by modulating the intensity of an optical beam, and individual photon arrivals are counted at the photodetector receiver. The transmitted signal, which is chosen to satisfy peak and average constraints, undergoes multiplicative fading, which occurs over coherence time intervals of fixed duration. The fade coefficient (channel state) remains constant in each coherence interval, and varies across successive such intervals in an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fashion. A single-letter characterization of the capacity of this channel is obtained when the receiver is provided with perfect channel state information (CSI) while the transmitter CSI can be imperfect.

A class of band-limited signals as well as signals which are non-band-limited are taken into consideration. The proposed reconstruction method is a smooth post-filtering correction of the classical WS interpolation series. We assess both the point-wise and global accuracy of the proposed reconstruction algorithm for a broad class of dependent noise processes. This includes short and long-memory stationary errors being independent of the sampling rate. We also examine a class of noise processes for which the correlation function depends on the sampling rate. Whereas the short-memory errors have relatively small influence on the reconstruction accuracy, the long-memory errors can greatly slow down the convergence rate. In the case of the noise model depending on the sampling rate further degradation of the algorithm accuracy is observed. We give quantitative explanations of these phenomena by deriving rates at which the reconstruction error tends to zero. We argue that the obtained rates are close to be optimal. In fact, in a number of special cases they agree with known optimal min-max rates.

In the rate-constrained relay channel, the relay cannot reliably decode or encode beyond a rate constraint R macr. A cut-set upper bound, and rate-constrained variations of decode-and-forward and estimate-and-forward protocol are derived. It is observed that relative performance of the unconstrained protocols does not predict relative performance of the constrained protocols; that is, estimate-and-forward almost always offers superior performance for small rate constraints. A new metric, denoted as the relay efficiency, measures the slope at which the relay channel rate increases over the relay-less channel. While the cut-set upper bound has a relay efficiency of one for the Gaussian relay channel at R macr = 0, the two new protocols do not. Finally, it is shown that an effective relay rate constraint can be computed for general relay protocols. To demonstrate this concept, a Markovian amplify-and-forward protocol, in which the relay does not perform any explicit encoding or decoding, is examined and compared to the introduced rate-constrained protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4252316/04252345.pdf","startPage":"2616","endPage":"2624","publicationTitle":"IEEE

Parallel Channels: Gallager Bounds and Applications to Turbo-Like Codes","abstract":"The transmission of coded communication systems is widely modeled to take place over a set of parallel channels. This model is used for transmission over block-fading channels, rate-compatible puncturing of turbo-like codes, multicarrier signaling, multilevel coding, etc. New upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding error probability are derived in the parallel-channel setting. We focus on the generalization of the Gallager-type bounds and discuss the connections between some versions of these bounds. The tightness of these bounds for parallel channels is exemplified for structured ensembles of turbo codes, repeat-accumulate (RA) codes, and some of their recent variations (e.g., punctured accumulate-repeat-accumulate codes). The bounds on the decoding error probability of an ML decoder are compared to computer simulations of iterative decoding. The new bounds show a remarkable improvement over the union bound and some other previously reported bounds for independent parallel channels. This improvement is exemplified for relatively short block lengths, and it is pronounced when the block length is increased. In the asymptotic case, where we let the block length tend to infinity, inner bounds on the attainable channel regions of modern coding techniques under ML decoding are obtained, based solely on the asymptotic growth rates of the average distance spectra of these code ensembles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252346/","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4252346/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9600535","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coding for Parallel Channels: Gallager Bounds and Applications to Turbo-Like Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for Parallel Channels: Gallager Bounds and Applications to Turbo-Like Codes","sourcePdf":"53tit07-sason.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118476S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4252316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4252316","articleId":"4252346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252347,"authors":[{"name":"Roxana Smarandache","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Roxana","lastName":"Smarandache","id":"37283033400"},{"name":"Pascal O.

In the context of linear programming (LP) decoding, one's attention needs to be shifted to the pseudo-codewords, in particular, to the minimal pseudo-codewords and their pseudo-weights. In this paper, we investigate some families of codes that have good properties under LP decoding, namely certain families of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that are derived from projective and Euclidean planes: we study the structure of their minimal pseudo-codewords and give lower bounds on their pseudo-weight. Besides this main focus, we also present some results that hold for pseudo-codewords and minimal pseudo-codewords of any Tanner graph, and we highlight how the importance of minimal pseudo-codewords under LP decoding varies depending on which binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channel is used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","volume":"53","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9598908","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252347/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-Codeword Analysis of Tanner Graphs From Projective and Euclidean Planes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-Codeword Analysis of Tanner Graphs From Projective and Euclidean Planes","sourcePdf":"53tit07-smarandache.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126048S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4252316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4252316","articleId":"4252347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4252348,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Somekh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Somekh","id":"38336938100"},{"name":"Benjamin M.

Depending on exact performance requirements, a nitridation step may not be necessary, as its benefits are limited (on ~2.0 nm equivalent oxide thickness films) to a factor of 2 reduction in leakage current density, with 4% and 7% reduction in mobility and drive current, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252378/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9598897","volume":"54","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of Nitridation of Hafnium Silicate Dielectrics: A Comparison Between Thermal and Plasma Nitridation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of Nitridation of Hafnium Silicate Dielectrics: A Comparison Between Thermal and Plasma Nitridation","sourcePdf":"54ted07-osullivan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103416S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4252351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4252351","articleId":"4252378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252402,"authors":[{"name":"Mark B.

We have successfully measured and evaluated electrical characteristics of periphery and cell array transistors of 80 nm DRAM using nanoprober. Measurements for Metal Contact (MC), Bit Line (BL) and Bit Line Contact (BLC) probing were proceeded and compared with Test Element Group (TEG) probing results. Interconnect Characterization Environment (ICE) simulation was also carried out to verify the current decrease of BLC probing results. Measurement for characteristics of memory cell array transistors, which had 150 nm pitch, of 80 mn DRAM was possible.

An innovative approach for write-margin extraction has recently been published at the ISSCC'2006 conference. This approach makes use of test structure giving access to internal node. Here, this approach is evaluated through our 65 nm process and it is shown that the layout and probing of the innovative test structure induces a write delay. As a consequence an adaptation of this innovative methodology is proposed. The new combined solution gives promising results, in terms of accuracy and spread, to better follow the process development of advanced SRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252413/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9702599","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Combined Methodology for Write-Margin Extraction of Advanced SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Combined Methodology for Write-Margin Extraction of Advanced SRAM","confLoc":"Bunkyo-ku, Japan","sourcePdf":"ICMTS-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039206S","chronDate":"19-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252392","isNumber":"4252393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252392","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4252393","articleId":"4252413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4252419,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To design more robust circuits it is required to characterize device variability within die, within wafer, wafer to wafer as well as lot to lot. Large samples of device measurements are necessary for accurate variability characterization. A novel Characterization Vehicle (CV) has been developed, which achieves an extremely efficient placement of several hundred devices by arranging them underneath the probing pads.

The vehicle in question is the T-wing and it is a tail-sitting UAV. The T-Wing can fly in vertical and horizontal flight modes, using propeller wash over the control surfaces for control in vertical flight. These two flight conditions and the fundamentally different vehicle dynamics between them give rise to a challenging control problem. The predictive control and guidance strategy developed in this research synthesises non-linearity by creating a new linear model from a non-linear vehicle model at every time step. This methodology allows the use of efficient quadratic programming techniques to find the control solution. The continuous linearization ensures that the current linear problem is always a close approximation to the current nonlinear situation. This predictive controller has been successfully flight-tested in the vertical flight mode, running in real-time on a 400 MHz, PC-104 flight computer using xPC Target software.","doi":"10.1109/IDC.2007.374541","publicationTitle":"2007 Information, Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Information, Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252449/4252450/04252493.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDC.2007.374541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Guidance and Control for a Tail-Sitting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252493/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Guidance and Control for a Tail-Sitting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9702247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252493/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Guidance and Control for a Tail-Sitting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"IDC-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03284S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252449","isNumber":"4252450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252449","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4252450","articleId":"4252493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252502,"authors":[{"name":"Sridhar Karuppasami","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Karuppasami","id":"37688865700"},{"name":"William G.

Graphs are a powerful mathematical tool that can be used to represent multi-agent systems such as multi-robotic systems and distributed networks. The arrangement of nodes in a graph can sometimes be required to satisfy an optimality criterion for the distributed network. The search for globally optimal graph permutations is an NP-complete problem. Although exhaustive search techniques can yield the global optimum, they are often computationally expensive. PSO is a relatively new heuristic search algorithm that can be modified to accommodate for the nature of optimal combinatorial and permutation problems. In this paper, a modified discrete particle swarm optimiser is presented that can be used to find optimal graph permutations efficiently for large population sets. An energy deviation function was used to describe the associated morph between two graph configurations and preserve permutation invariant shape abstractions. The PSO algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance to exhaustive search techniques and is a promising search algorithm for the graph reconfiguration problem.","doi":"10.1109/IDC.2007.374578","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"2007 Information, Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDC.2007.374578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252450","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Information, Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252449/4252450/04252530.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimisation Approach to Graph Permutations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252530/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimisation Approach to Graph Permutations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252530/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9702268","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimisation Approach to Graph Permutations","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"IDC-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062592S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252449","isNumber":"4252450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252449","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4252450","articleId":"4252530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252565,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyue Zou","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qiyue","lastName":"Zou","id":"37269661300"},{"name":"Alireza Tarighat","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Tarighat","id":"37281996800"},{"name":"Ali H.

These impairments can severely degrade the achievable effective signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. In this paper, we propose a joint compensation scheme to mitigate the effects of the IQ imbalance and phase noise in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems. For ease of notation, a system with one transmit and two receive antennas is used to illustrate how to exploit the structure of MIMO transceivers to efficiently compensate for such impairments. We exploit the fact that the two received signals suffer from the same phase noise distortion, making it possible to achieve better compensation results than the single-input single-output case. The pilot tones in OFDM symbols are exploited to aid data recovery, and the data symbols are jointly estimated with the phase noise components that are parameterized by using the principle component analysis technique. The sensitivity of OFDM receivers to the analog impairments is significantly lowered, which helps simplify the RF and analog circuitry design in terms of implementation cost, power consumption, and silicon fabrication yield.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378176","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252565.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Joint Compensation of IQ Imbalances and Phase Noise in MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252565/","displayDocTitle":"On the Joint Compensation of IQ Imbalances and Phase Noise in MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538887","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252565/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Joint Compensation of IQ Imbalances and Phase Noise in MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049778S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252577,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Ghafar-Zadeh","affiliation":["Department of Elec.

The circuit is designed using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistor (TFT) technology. The simulation results based on the measured characteristics of a-Si:H TFTs show that the proposed pixel circuit can successfully scale up the current data during readout and therefore provide higher gain compared with the conventional current mode APS circuits. The design can also compensate for characteristic variations (e.g. mobility and threshold voltage shift) in a-Si:H TFTs under prolonged gate voltage stress. The readout circuit exploits correlated double sampling (CDS) technique to reduce the offset current, low frequency noise and fixed-pattern noise (FPN) on the array operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378229","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252579.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel current scaling active pixel sensor with correlated double sampling readout circuit for real time medical x-ray imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel current scaling active pixel sensor with correlated double sampling readout circuit for real time medical x-ray imaging","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538907","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252579/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel current scaling active pixel sensor with correlated double sampling readout circuit for real time medical x-ray imaging","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049404S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252591,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid R.

To ensure the correctness of crypto hardware, we should conduct testing at fabrication and infield. However, the state-of-the-art scan-based test techniques, to achieve high test qualities, need to increase the testability of the circuit under test, which carries a potential of being misused to reveal the secret information of the crypto hardware. Thus, to develop efficient test strategies for crypto hardware to achieve high test quality without compromising security becomes an important task. In this paper we discuss the development of a design-for-secure-test (DFST) technique for pipelined AES to overcome the above contradiction between security and test quality in testing crypto hardware. Unlike previous works, the proposed method can keep all the secrets inside and provide high test quality and fault diagnosis ability as well. Furthermore, the proposed DFST technique can significantly reduce test application time, test data volume, and test generation effort as additional benefits.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378243","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252593.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design for Secure Test - A Case Study on Pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252593/","displayDocTitle":"Design for Secure Test - A Case Study on Pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538980","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252593/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design for Secure Test - A Case Study on Pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128905S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4252596,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Qu","affiliation":["Communication Platforms, Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Qu","id":"37287583100"},{"name":"Juha-Pekka Soininen","affiliation":["Communication Platforms, Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha-Pekka","lastName":"Soininen","id":"37267006900"},{"name":"Jari Nurmi","affiliation":["Institute of Digital and Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Nurmi","id":"37274976400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252596","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Dynamic scheduling","Hardware","Tiles","Processor scheduling","Prefetching","Communication system control","Delay","Circuits","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow graphs","genetic algorithms","processor scheduling","reconfigurable architectures","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","dynamically reconfigurable hardware","tasks scheduling","NP-hard problem","task allocation","random task graphs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252596","abstract":"In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) for scheduling tasks onto dynamically reconfigurable devices is presented.

At the sampling instants, the values of the DT state variables are thus exactly equalized to those of the given CT modulator while the time consuming CT simulation itself has been replaced by an efficient and rapid DT one.

The study of static errors, including gain imbalance, phase errors, and DC offsets has received considerable attention in the literature. Much less attention has been paid to the effect of frequency-dependent imperfections that arise in the analog reconstruction filters commonly employed in direct-conversion structures. This paper presents results of research into robust methods for automatic digital compensation for these non ideal frequency-dependent characteristics. The design and implementation of FIR and eigenfilter structures to achieve compensation are presented. As a specific application the paper considers a direct-conversion system used to generate continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) signals. The performance achievable using the proposed digital compensation structures is presented, including measurement results taken on a DSP-based modulator platform.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency dependence","Digital modulation","Finite impulse response filter","Radio frequency","Radio transmitters","Image reconstruction","RF signals","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Band pass filters","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous phase modulation","FIR filters","frequency shift keying","modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency dependent imperfections","direct conversion I-Q modulators","analog reconstruction filters","robust methods","automatic digital compensation","FIR","eigenfilter structures","continuous-phase frequency-shift keying signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378387","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252623.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Compensation of Frequency Dependent Imperfections in Direct Conversion I-Q Modulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Compensation of Frequency Dependent Imperfections in Direct Conversion I-Q Modulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252623/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252623/","accessionNumber":"9540894","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Compensation of Frequency Dependent Imperfections in Direct Conversion I-Q Modulators","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122385S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252630,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406106900"},{"name":"Wenli Xu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278553200"},{"name":"Qionghai Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qionghai","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273514100"},{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281434600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252630","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image coding","Bit rate","Noise shaping","Statistics","Filter bank","Motion estimation","PSNR","Automation","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","2D dual-tree discrete welet transform","direction-selective basis functions","iterative projection-based noise shaping method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate image compression using 2D dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT), which is an overcomplete transform with direction-selective basis functions.

Experimental results show that SPIHT is more effective than EBCOT for DDWT, and the DDWT-SPIHT coder outperforms JPEG2000 at low bit rates and is comparable to JPEG2000 at high bit rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Compression using 2D Dual-tree Discrete Wavelet Transform (DDWT)","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378394","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252630.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Compression using 2D Dual-tree Discrete Wavelet Transform (DDWT)","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252630/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538904","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Compression using 2D Dual-tree Discrete Wavelet Transform (DDWT)","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102771S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252636,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yin","id":"37322809600"},{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Ghovanloo","id":"37275363200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252636","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2511},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Bandwidth","Switches","Cutoff frequency","Output feedback","Neurofeedback","Voltage","Ambient intelligence","CMOS process","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","preamplifiers","recorders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-noise preamplifier","adjustable gain","adjustable bandwidth","biopotential recording applications","common mode feedback","CMOS process","rail-to-rail input DC range","2 pF","8 muA","0.015 to 700 Hz","40 to 4E3 Hz","120 to 12E3 Hz","39.3 dB","45.6 dB","1.5 micron","0.7 mV","1.7 V","3.6 muV"]}],"abstract":"We have developed a fully differential low-power low-noise preamplifier with multiple adjustable parameters for biopotential and neural recording applications.

The results reveal that the proposed method behaves better than these methods in terms of fault detection and correction of multiple faults regarding to the area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539021","htmlLink":"/document/4252647/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Upsets Tolerance in SRAM Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Upsets Tolerance in SRAM Memory","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117011S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252655,"authors":[{"name":"Ik-Jae Chun","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ik-Jae","lastName":"Chun","id":"37267199600"},{"name":"Tae-Moon Roh","affiliation":["IT Convergence & Components Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Moon","lastName":"Roh","id":"37290190500"},{"name":"Bo-Gwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bo-Gwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276227700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252655","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Scalability","Network interfaces","Hardware design languages","Communication networks","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Communication system control","Performance analysis","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","hardware description languages","integrated circuit interconnections","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary-truncated CDMA","on-chip network","communication network","on-chip interconnection","communication link","direct sequence code division multiple access","binary-truncated channel","interconnection module","synchronizer","hub network interface","Verilog HDL"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new communication network for on-chip interconnection. The network concentrates on small size communication link, non blocking effect, scalability. The network is based on a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) technique with a binary-truncated channel. By the truncation, the network drastically reduces data transfer lines. The network architecture is largely divided into four modules: a CDMA-based network interface, an interconnection module, a synchronizer, and a hub network interface. Especially the network includes a reverse channel for the efficiency of packet flow control. The authors guarantee the scalability of network by both a PN-code reuse and a hierarchical structure. The authors also decouple functional and communication tasks for scalability and utilize a modular architecture for flexibility. The network architecture is analyzed in terms of performance, area, and physical architecture. The network is done using fully synthesizable Verilog HDL to enhance the portability between process technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378473","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252655.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"397","endPage":"400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary-Truncated CDMA-Based On-Chip Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Binary-Truncated CDMA-Based On-Chip Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252655/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539025","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252655/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary-Truncated CDMA-Based On-Chip Network","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059473S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252657,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Layer","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Layer","id":"37265751000"},{"name":"Daniel Schaupp","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Schaupp","id":"37688108300"},{"name":"Hans-Jorg Pfleiderer","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Jorg","lastName":"Pfleiderer","id":"37265752500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252657","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Data processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Network synthesis","Electronic design automation and methodology","Costs","Very large scale integration","Design optimization","Resumes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","electronic design automation","field programmable gate arrays","optimisation","parallel processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aware comparator networks optimization","parallel data processing","FPGA synthesis","hardware synthesis","electronic design automation tools","Batcher bitonic algorithm","time complexity","very large scale integration","VLSI","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"As hardware synthesis tries to go behavioral, system designers tend to neglect low level optimizations, e.g., retiming or resources reuse. However, complex architectures such as highly parallel sorter cores cannot be directly packed into standard devices by the electronic design automation (EDA) tools and often needs fundamental rethinking. Therefore this paper resumes a cost study of the hardware realization of a recurrent parameterizable N-sorter based on Batcher's bitonic algorithm and shows how to recombine different network sizes by preserving data throughput. With the time complexity of the original bitonic sorter, the recurrent architecture yields a lower area complexity by reducing the communication within the network and minimizes the cost in terms of hardware resources. Furthermore, the validity domain of internal architectural parameter combinations demonstrate the existence of an optimal area-throughput trade-off for very large scale integration (VLSI) models based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) synthesis, as well as a full scalability of the highly parallel sorting scheme","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378475","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252657.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area and Throughput Aware Comparator Networks Optimization for Parallel Data Processing on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252657/","displayDocTitle":"Area and Throughput Aware Comparator Networks Optimization for Parallel Data Processing on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252657/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area and Throughput Aware Comparator Networks Optimization for Parallel Data Processing on FPGA","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075244S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252662,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Tso Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Tso","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279529000"},{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291229500"},{"name":"Shey-Shi Lu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shey-Shi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280072300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252662","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252662","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Low-noise amplifiers","Inductors","Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Voltage","Noise figure","Energy consumption","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","impedance matching","inductors","low noise amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully integrated concurrent low noise amplifier","dual-band low noise amplifier","suspended inductors","BiCMOS technology","impedance matching","2.3 GHz","4.5 GHz","14.3 dB","14.4 dB","-11.5 dB","-12.8 dB","2.5 dB","3.0 dB","11.9 mW","0.35 micron","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dual-band","suspended","LNA","inductors"]}],"abstract":"A fully integrated concurrent dual-band low noise amplifier with suspended inductors is first reported.

The whole control system is based on networks of spiking neurons. A correlation based rule, namely the spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), is implemented for an efficient learning. The main interesting consequence is that the system is able to learn high-level sensor features, based on a set of basic reflexes, depending on some low-level sensor inputs.

The second is a new result which shows that the degree of the M x M system z\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n G(z) is equal to the degree of G(z) plus M if and only if the causal system G(z) has an anticausal inverse.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252721.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the degree of MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Linear systems","Delay","Context","Interconnected systems","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","MIMO communication","MIMO systems","radiocommunication","system theory","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","MIMO channels","wireless communications systems","linear system theory","McMillan degree","M times M MIMO system","M x M system z-1 G(z)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the degree of MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252721/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539036","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the degree of MIMO systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049006S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4252722,"authors":[{"name":"Se-Hyeon Kang","affiliation":["System LSI Division, Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-Hyeon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37276367400"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252722","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Delay","Equations","Lattices","Maximum likelihood detection","Euclidean distance","Hardware","Transmitting antennas","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed sphere decoding","vertically incremental computation","maximum likelihood detection","decoding algorithms","partial Euclidean distance computation","critical path delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252722","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377896","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","abstract":"Sphere decoding enables maximum likelihood (ML) detection with lower complexity than other decoding algorithms, but it still suffers from large computational delay.

Using the proposed architecture, three different sub-l-V single-stage operational amplifiers have been designed and simulated in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology that confirm the suitable operation of the circuit in very-low supply voltages and different speeds.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377906","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252732.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"708","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Low-Voltage, Low-Power, High-Speed Operational Amplifiers Using Body-Driven Gain-Boosting Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low-Voltage, Low-Power, High-Speed Operational Amplifiers Using Body-Driven Gain-Boosting Technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9539058","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252732/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Low-Voltage, Low-Power, High-Speed Operational Amplifiers Using Body-Driven Gain-Boosting Technique","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056128S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252733,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Singh","id":"37687982300"},{"name":"Yves Audet","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Audet","id":"37273900300"},{"name":"Yves Gagnon","affiliation":["LTRIM Technologies, Inc., Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37428464100"},{"name":"Yvon Savaria","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Savaria","id":"37276922900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252733","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Resistors","Voltage","CMOS process","Application specific integrated circuits","Operational amplifiers","Circuit topology","Temperature distribution","Robustness","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit trimming","offset reduction","precision CMOS amplifier","CMOS operational amplifier topology","laser-trimmable diffused resistors","on-chip CMOS bias generation circuit","post-layout simulation","0.18 micron","-40 to 85 C","3.3 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252733","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252733.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Circuit Trimming Technique for Offset Reduction in a Precision CMOS Amplifier","abstract":"This article presents an application of a recently reported IC trimming technique using laser diffused resistors to reduce the input referred offset voltage of a precision amplifier.

One of the important requirements for biphasic pulses is to maintain charge balance. Since the durations of the cathodic and anodic current pulses are usually set to the same value, the amplitudes of these current pulses are therefore required to be matched. In this paper, a self-calibration technique is proposed to match the amplitudes of the cathodic and anodic current pulses. For pulse amplitude of ~3mA, the amplitude difference between the two pulses can be reduced to less than 2\u03bcA after calibration.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378031","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"817","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Matching Technique for Biphasic Stimulation Pulse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Matching Technique for Biphasic Stimulation Pulse","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252760/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508265","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252760/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Matching Technique for Biphasic Stimulation Pulse","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052232S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252761,"authors":[{"name":"Hoda Mohammadzade","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Hoda","lastName":"Mohammadzade","id":"37595977400"},{"name":"Len T.

The paper examines this form of coding using experimental data from a multi-layered multi-chip system which consists of an artificial retina, a convolution filter bank and a winner-take-all network which detect the position of a moving object. The spike outputs of the convolution stage can be described by an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution of Gaussian profile, although the underlying building blocks are completely deterministic and exhibit only a small amount of variation. The authors discuss a method for measuring the accuracy of the asynchronous spiking representation in both time and value, thereby quantifying the performance of the winner-take-all network in determining the position of a ball rotating in front of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252769.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"856","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying Input and Output Spike Statistics of a Winner-Take-All Network in a Vision System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Machine vision","Convolution","Real time systems","Retina","Filter bank","Object detection","Position measurement","Rotation measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial organs","computer vision","eye","multichip modules","Poisson distribution","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike statistics","winner-take-all network","vision system","real-time vision","multilayered multichip system","artificial retina","convolution filter bank","position detection","moving object","Poisson distribution","Gaussian profile","asynchronous spiking representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying Input and Output Spike Statistics of a Winner-Take-All Network in a Vision System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539065","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying Input and Output Spike Statistics of a Winner-Take-All Network in a Vision System","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048736S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252770,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Kristian Otnes Berge","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Hans Kristian Otnes","lastName":"Berge","id":"37688051400"},{"name":"Philipp Hafliger","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Hafliger","id":"37265468900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252770","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Application specific integrated circuits","Timing","Protocols","Low voltage","Pulse circuits","Wires","Programmable logic arrays","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","multichip modules","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed serial AER","FPGA","high speed serial address-event representation link","low voltage differential signaling interface","ASIC implementation","multichip PCB","high speed serial link"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252770","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378041","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","abstract":"The paper presents a high speed serial address-event representation (AER) link with a capacity of 41.66Mevents/sec.

Although the feature fusion method performs well for high and moderate SNRs, its performance degrades rapidly at low SNRs. Moreover, auxiliary features that are robust to acoustic noise may sometimes be unreliable, because of sensor misplacements etc, which can further degrade the performance. Furthermore, noisy sensor signals may exist not only in the test data but also in the training data. Here, the feature fusion method is combined with a missing data technique to improve noise-robustness at low SNRs. An auxiliary feature is used both for feature fusion and for detecting the unreliable speech frames. Noisy auxiliary features are addressed using a missing data approach both in the decoding and training systems.

When a flash picture is encoded, the intensity changes drastically and non-uniformly so that motion estimation can not find a well-matching block in reference pictures. Accordingly, much more bits are generated than the neighboring non-flash pictures. In this paper, a novel flash picture coding method which represents a new concept of video coding is proposed. Based on human vision system (HVS) property, rather than encoding the original flash picture, it encodes an artificial flash picture which is made up of an artificial non-flash (or de-flashed) picture and some parameters for flash effect modeling. Experiments show the proposed flash picture coding method greatly reduces the coded bits of the flash picture while still provides a competitive subjective quality.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378135","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"989","endPage":"992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Human Vision System based Flash Picture Coding Method for Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Human Vision System based Flash Picture Coding Method for Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252803/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539144","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252803/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Human Vision System based Flash Picture Coding Method for Video Coding","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039763S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252807,"authors":[{"name":"Huanxin Guan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Huanxin","lastName":"Guan","id":"37543340800"},{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Zhanshan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhanshan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291899000"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Derong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252807","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Recurrent neural networks","Delay effects","Neural networks","Symmetric matrices","Sufficient conditions","Information science","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Associative memory","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","functional equations","linear matrix inequalities","recurrent neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability","recurrent neural networks","time varying delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory","functional differential equations","linear matrix inequality approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378139","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252807.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Asymptotic Stability of Recurrent Neural Networks with Time Varying Delays","abstract":"In this paper, two sufficient conditions are established for the global asymptotic stability of recurrent neural networks with multiple time varying delays.

Clearly there is room for further improvement on even optimal technology mapping results if logic perturbation can be applied. In this paper, we propose logic-aware minimization methods to further reduce both depth and area for the purely-graph-based depth-optimal FPGA mapped results. For area minimization, the proposed method perturbs the subject circuit using rewiring technique and incrementally reduce the mapping area. Improving the outstanding technology mapping algorithm DAOMap, the method can further reduce area by 10.9%. An area reduction of 13.4% is achieved with synthesis results from BDS-pga. A logic level reduction scheme is also proposed and it further reduces LUT depth for half of the circuits tested without area penalty. A combination of logic level reduction and area minimization techniques can improve both the LUT depth and area by 11.3% and 6.1%, compared to results of FlowMap and FlowSYN respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378150","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252818.pdf","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Further Improve Excellent Graph-Based FPGA Technology Mapping by Rewiring","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539123","htmlLink":"/document/4252818/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Improve Excellent Graph-Based FPGA Technology Mapping by Rewiring","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064992S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252819,"authors":[{"name":"Shilpa Bhoj","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Bhoj","id":"37660369300"},{"name":"Dinesh Bhatia","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37331957500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252819","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Power system modeling","Temperature sensors","Temperature distribution","Power dissipation","Power system reliability","Fabrics","Thermal conductivity","Integrated circuit modeling","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal modeling","temperature driven placement","FPGA","resistive mesh model","thermal profiling"]}],"abstract":"With rapid technology scaling and increased use of FPGAs in mobile and low power applications, the effect of temperature on power, performance and reliability has become a challenge for system designers.

The model exploits the characteristic features of the reconfigurable fabric to produce an efficient and accurate thermal estimate. We then employ the thermal model in a novel temperature driven placement tool for FPGAs. Our placement tool achieves an average temperature reduction of 2.26degC and produces a more uniform thermal distribution.

hardware architecture for a flexible probability density estimation unit to be used in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, and targeted for mobile platforms. The speech recognition system is based on hidden Markov models and consists of two computationally intensive parts - the probability density estimation using Gaussian distributions, and the Viterbi decoding. The power hungry nature of these computations prevents porting the application successfully to mobile devices. We have designed a flexible probability estimation unit that is both power efficient and meets real time requirements while being flexible enough to handle emerging speech recognition techniques. The flexible nature of the design allows it to utilize emerging power and computation reduction techniques (at the algorithm level) to achieve up to an 80% power reduction as compared to conventional designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508282","htmlLink":"/document/4252835/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flexible Low Power Probability Density Estimation Unit For Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Low Power Probability Density Estimation Unit For Speech Recognition","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059633S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252847,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Zhang","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37695227100"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37273386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252847","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":439},"abstract":"This paper presents a low power 4-bit ADC for sub-GHz Ultra Wideband (UWB) receivers. The power efficiency is achieved by taking advantage of the low duty cycle feature of UWB impulse. After the synchronization is achieved, the burst-mode sampling approach is employed to avoid unnecessary operations. So, the ADC only samples at the time when a pulse is expected and stays in standby during the rest of the time. The proposed burst sampling ADC employs five interleaved pipeline flash ADCs controlled by a low duty cycle 25 MHz sampling clock with five different phases. The resistor ladder reference circuit is eliminated by using a modified Quantum Voltage comparator, which can generate the reference voltages internally. The proposed ADC has been designed and simulated by using TSMC 0.18\u03bcm CMOS process. Simulation results show that the proposed 4-bit ADC can operate at 1G sample/s for UWB impulse with power consumption of 7.6 mW.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Voltage","Circuit simulation","Ultra wideband technology","Receivers","Synchronization","Pipelines","Clocks","Resistors","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","ladder networks","radio receivers","reference circuits","sampling methods","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved burst sampling ADC","impulse UWB radio","low power ADC","ultra wideband receivers","UWB receivers","power efficiency","burst-mode sampling approach","pipeline flash ADC","resistor ladder reference circuit","modified quantum voltage comparator","CMOS process","25 MHz","7.6 mW","0.18 micron","4 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378257","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252847.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Power 4-bit Interleaved Burst Sampling ADC for Sub-GHz Impulse UWB Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low Power 4-bit Interleaved Burst Sampling ADC for Sub-GHz Impulse UWB Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252847/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252847/","accessionNumber":"9539243","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Power 4-bit Interleaved Burst Sampling ADC for Sub-GHz Impulse UWB Radio","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045263S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4252848,"authors":[{"name":"Kwen-Siong Chong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kwen-Siong","lastName":"Chong","id":"37265465500"},{"name":"Bah-Hwee Gwee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bah-Hwee","lastName":"Gwee","id":"37271115600"},{"name":"Joseph S.

The algorithm optimizes pattern matching process through two key innovations of parallel pattern matching using incoming content filter and multiple character matching using trie pruning. The hardware implementation is capable of performing at line-speeds and handle traffic rates up to OC-192, the underlying architecture allows for multiple patterns to be detected and for the system to gracefully recover from a failed partial match, the throughput of the system does not degrade with the increase in the number of patterns or the length of the patterns to be matched. The solution described outperforms most current implementations in terms of speed and memory requirement and outperforms TCAM based solutions in terms of power consumption, area, and cost while remaining competitive in terms of throughput and update times. The complete Snort rule set (2005 release) and VoIP RFC were used to validate our performance and achieve a throughput of 12Gbps with 6KBytes of content filter memory and 0.3 MBytes of total memory for Snort and 0.5KBytes of filter memory and 12KBytes of total memory for SIP.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252902.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1372","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Architecture of a Parallel Pattern Matching Engine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Pattern matching","Engines","Throughput","Computer architecture","Payloads","Technological innovation","Matched filters","Degradation","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","data communication","digital circuits","logic circuits","parallel processing","quality of service","string matching","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel pattern matching engine","network security","QoS applications","multiple string matches","hardware algorithms","parallel pipelined pattern matching engine","trie based pattern matching","multiple character matching","trie pruning","OC-192","Snort rule set","VoIP RFC","12 Gbit/s","0.3 MBytes","0.5 Mbyte","6 kBytes","12 kBytes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Architecture of a Parallel Pattern Matching Engine","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252902/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539187","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Architecture of a Parallel Pattern Matching Engine","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049291S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4252904,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Jain","affiliation":["IP Development, CoWare India Private Limited, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Jain","id":"37084309500"},{"name":"Preeti Ranjan Panda","affiliation":["Department of CSE, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Preeti Ranjan","lastName":"Panda","id":"37337867200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252904","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":258},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Pipelined VLSI Architecture for Lifting-Based 2D-Discrete Wavelet Transform","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252904.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1380","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Delay","Buffer storage","Image coding","Hardware","Computer architecture","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined VLSI architecture","lifting-based 2D-discrete wavelet transform","JPEG2000 image compression","multiplier latency","power saving","area saving"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252904","abstract":"The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) forms the core of the JPEG2000 image compression algorithm.

The authors have shown that the constant multipliers defined by JPEG2000 standard, have latency of about 1.6 times the general adder latency. Hence, while finding the critical path, the basic assumption of multiplier latency being much greater than the adder latency does not hold for DWT in JPEG2000.

CPG networks display oscillatory activities that actuates individual or groups of muscles in a coordinated fashion so that the limbs of the animal are flexed and extended at the appropriate time and with the required velocity for the animal to efficiently traverse various types of terrain, and to recover from environmental perturbation. Typically, the CPG networks are constructed with many neurons, each of which has a number of control parameters. As the number of muscles increases, it is often impossible to manually, albeit intelligently, select the network parameters for a particular movement. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to reconfigure the parameters on-line. This paper describes how genetic algorithms (GA) can be used for on-line (re)configuring of CPG networks for a bipedal robot. We show that the neuron parameters and connection weights/network topology of a canonical walking network can be reconfigured within a few of generations of the GA. The networks, constructed with integrate-and-fire-with-adaptation (IFA) neurons, are implemented with a microcontroller and can be reconfigured to vary walking speed from 0.5Hz to 3.5Hz. The phase relationship between the hips and knees can be arbitrarily set (to within 1 degree) and prescribed complex joint angle profiles are realized. This is a powerful approach to generating complex muscle synergies for robots with multiple joints and distributed actuators.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378701","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252941.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1528","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuring of Spiking Central Pattern Generator Networks for Bipedal Walking Using Genetic Algorthms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Configuring of Spiking Central Pattern Generator Networks for Bipedal Walking Using Genetic Algorthms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9539240","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4252941/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuring of Spiking Central Pattern Generator Networks for Bipedal Walking Using Genetic Algorthms","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048186S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4252942,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Uysal","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37396825300"},{"name":"Harsha Sathyendra","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Harsha","lastName":"Sathyendra","id":"37688136400"},{"name":"John G.

As a benchmark, the feature set is used in a biologically plausible model with a spike-based, liquid state machine classifier for a simple acoustic classification task.

These previous algorithms are performed independently of a video compression standard and therefore do not take advantage of the information obtained during the processing of the compression standard. This paper proposes a new recompression algorithm that makes use of the information from H.264 intra prediction results. The proposed algorithm decomposes a frame into 4times4 blocks which are then compressed into 64-bit segments. The result of 4times4 intra prediction is used to select the scan order of the 4times4 block and DPCM (differential pulse code modulation) is performed along this scan order. Then, the DPCM results are further compressed by Golomb-Rice coding. The proposed recompression algorithm is implemented in hardware and integrated with an H.264 encoder. The proposed algorithm improves the average PSNR by 2.9dB compared to the previous work in (Lee, 2003). The hardware cost for the implementation of the recompression algorithm is 28 K gates and the additional latency to read the compressed frame memory is 162 cycles per a macroblock","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378829","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252965.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Frame Recompression Algorithm Integrated with H.264 Video Compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4252965/","displayDocTitle":"A New Frame Recompression Algorithm Integrated with H.264 Video Compression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508324","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4252965/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Frame Recompression Algorithm Integrated with H.264 Video Compression","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038871S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4252965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4252971,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Gunnam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Gunnam","id":"37281719700"},{"name":"Gwan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37272560200"},{"name":"Weihuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Weihuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292853600"},{"name":"Mark Yeary","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Yeary","id":"37279024700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4252971","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":252,"totalDownloads":915},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Code standards","Iterative decoding","Computer architecture","Message passing","Bit error rate","Iterative algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Turbo codes","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","codecs","IEEE standards","message passing","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate layered decoder architecture","block LDPC codes","low density parity check codes","IEEE 802.11n wireless standard","value-reuse property","block-serial scheduling","turbo decoding message passing algorithm","data-forwarding","out-of-order processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4252971","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04252971.pdf","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378835","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Rate Layered Decoder Architecture for Block LDPC Codes of the IEEE 802.11n Wireless Standard","abstract":"We present a new multi-rate architecture for decoding block LDPC codes in IEEE 802.11n standard.

Previously, we have demonstrated the noise-robust performance of the predictive ESN classifier in automatic speech recognition experiments in which the network was trained to predict the next frame of speech features. Classification performance was limited because the predictive models lacked discriminability, so we changed the model output to a one-of-many output encoding scheme and trained the model discriminatively. Performance was compared to a hidden Markov model (HMM) in small-vocabulary ASR experiments with additive noise. Accuracy of 50% was achieved by a discriminative ESN classifier at -8.5 dB SNR, compared to 0.4 dB SNR for a predictive ESN classifier and 6.6 dB SNR for an HMM. With discriminative training, a larger reservoir was employed for the discriminative ESN classifier compared to the predictive ESN classifier which resulted a larger memory depth and more noise-robust performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378015","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253002.pdf","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-robust automatic speech recognition using a discriminative echo state network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Noise-robust automatic speech recognition using a discriminative echo state network","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253002/","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539255","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253002/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-robust automatic speech recognition using a discriminative echo state network","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077391S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4253005,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshifumi Tada","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Tada","id":"37698565000"},{"name":"Yoko Uwate","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoko","lastName":"Uwate","id":"37332058800"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Nishio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Nishio","id":"37270701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253005","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253005","abstract":"Many people propose the method adding chaos noise to Hopfield neural network for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

Given a logic netlist, we first construct reduced order binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs) for the circuit in a partitioned manner, thereby allowing the approach to handle large designs. We place the ITE cells corresponding to the ROBDD nodes in a manner that minimizes crossings in the ROBDD graph. Our placement also effectively 'folds' the ITE cells of different variables into a single row, so as to obtain a layout with a more uniform distribution of ITE cells along each physical row of ITE cells. The design methodology has been demonstrated to implement sequential as well as combinational designs, by customizing the lowest 4 METAL layers along with their associated VIA layers. A low area and delay overhead is achieved, in comparison with an ASIC approach.

This digital signature generation device (SGD) was developed especially for RFID tags. The design parameters were low energy consumption, small chip area, robustness against cryptographic attacks, and flexibility. The SGD was designed to work as digital processor in an RFID tag requiring the tag to provide the secret key storage and a PRNG. The SHA-1 calculation needs to be included into the SGD to avoid a microcontroller on the tag. The asymmetric cryptosystem allows authentication of the tag to untrusted third parties without revealing the secret key. The ECDSA functionality was implemented using a prime field GF(p) and affine coordinates, an alternative way to reduce the die size and the costs of the tag.

Generally, due to the regularly structured parity-check matrix H of QC LDPC codes, the message updating computations in the check node unit (CNU) and the variable node unit (VNU) can be efficiently overlapped, which increases the decoding throughput by maximizing the hardware utilization efficiency (HUE). However, the partially overlapped decoding scheme cannot be used to design a highly-parallel decoding architecture for high-throughput applications. For (3, 5)-regular QC LDPC codes, our proposed method could reduce the hardware complexity by approximately 33% for the CNU and 20% for the VNU in the highly-parallel decoder architecture without any performance degradation. In addition, the power consumption can be minimized by reducing the total number of memory accesses for updated messages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253023/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9539291","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253023/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Highly-Parallel Decoder Architecture for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Highly-Parallel Decoder Architecture for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094416S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4253025,"authors":[{"name":"Akashi Satoh","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Security, AIST, Sotokanda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akashi","lastName":"Satoh","id":"37272588800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253025","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Counting circuits","Throughput","Equations","Cryptography","Binary decision diagrams","Libraries","Application specific integrated circuits","NIST","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","binary decision diagrams","CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","multiplying circuits","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel hardware architecture","Galois counter mode","authenticated encryption mode","CTR mode","multiply-adder","S-boxes","advanced encryption standard","binary decision tree","CMOS standard cell library","hash functions","102 Gbit/s","162 Gbit/s","0.13 micron"]}],"abstract":"Parallel hardware architecture for an authenticated encryption mode GCM (Galois Counter Mode) capable of a throughput higher than 100 Gbps is proposed.

Therefore, a parallel multiply-adder was designed and integrated into the GCM hardware with a 14-stage pipelined AES circuit and two kinds of S-box, composite field and BDD (Binary Decision Tree) versions.

An SRAM cell requires a minimum critical supply voltage (DRV) above which it preserves the stored-bit reliably. Due to process-variations, the intra-chip DRV exhibits variation with a distribution having a diminishing tail. In order to minimize leakage power while preserving data reliably, existing low-power design methods use a worst-case standby supply voltage. This worst-case voltage is larger than the highest DRV among all cells in an SRAM. In contrast, the approach uses aggressive voltage reduction and counters the ensuing unreliability by an error-control code based memory architecture. Using this approach, we explore fundamental trade-offs between power reduction and redundancy present in the SRAM. The authors establish fundamental bounds on the power reduction in terms of the DRV-distribution using techniques from information theory and algebraic coding theory. For an experimental test-chip DRV-distribution in the 90nm CMOS technology, the authors show that 49% power reduction with respect to (w.r.t.) the worst-case is a fundamental lower bound while 40% power reduction w.r.t. the worst-case is achievable by using a practical algebraic coding scheme. The authors also study the power reduction as a function of the block-length for low-latency codes since most applications using SRAM are latency constrained. The authors propose a reliable low-power memory architecture based on the Hamming code for the next test-chip implementation with a predicted power reduction of 33% while accounting for coding overheads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Voltage","Memory architecture","Testing","CMOS technology","Probability distribution","Design methodology","Counting circuits","Redundancy","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","CMOS memory circuits","error correction codes","Hamming codes","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static random access memories","SRAM cell","leakage-power reduction","data retention","standby supply voltage","error-control code","information theory","algebraic coding","CMOS technology","Hamming codes"]}],"publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253026.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378279","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Bounds on Power Reduction during Data-Retention in Standby SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253026/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Bounds on Power Reduction during Data-Retention in Standby SRAM","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508349","htmlLink":"/document/4253026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Bounds on Power Reduction during Data-Retention in Standby SRAM","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050317S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253029,"authors":[{"name":"Riaz Naseer","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Riaz","lastName":"Naseer","id":"37689399600"},{"name":"Younes Boulghassoul","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Younes","lastName":"Boulghassoul","id":"37267536700"},{"name":"Jeff Draper","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Draper","id":"37266688700"},{"name":"Sandeepan DasGupta","affiliation":["Institute for Space and Defense Electronics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeepan","lastName":"DasGupta","id":"37537956300"},{"name":"Art Witulski","affiliation":["Institute for Space and Defense Electronics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Art","lastName":"Witulski","id":"37296625500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253029","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253029","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Random access memory","Predictive models","Circuit simulation","Capacitance","Power supplies","Voltage","Logic circuits","Pulse circuits","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips","technology CAD (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static random access memories","SRAM chips","nodal capacitances","soft error rate","current pulse modeling","90 nm"]}],"abstract":"Due to continuous technology scaling, the reduction of nodal capacitances and the lowering of power supply voltages result in an ever decreasing minimal charge capable of upsetting the logic state of memory circuits.

A persistency of excitation (PE) property of the input signal is required for the algorithm to work. In this paper, the probability of fulfilling the PE property under different situations is studied. Four factors in the algorithm affect the PE property of the input signal: 1) signal constellation used; 2) precoder coefficients; 3) number of consecutive blocks; 4) a number called the repetition index. Theoretical derivations as well as numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the main points of this paper. Important conclusions are 1) that the probability of fulfilling the PE property increases and converges to unity when the number of received blocks increases but is always upper-bounded by a value less than unity when the repetition index increases; 2) that the probability of fulfilling the PE property is smaller when the algorithm is applied in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems than in single-carrier-cyclic-prefix (SC-CP) systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1902","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253034.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Persistency of Excitation for Blind Channel Estimation in Cyclic Prefix Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","OFDM","Numerical simulation","Constellation diagram","Virtual manufacturing","Transmitters","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","cyclic prefix system","excitation persistency","signal constellation","repetition index","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Persistency of Excitation for Blind Channel Estimation in Cyclic Prefix Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253034/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253034/","accessionNumber":"9539309","publicationDate":"May 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Persistency of Excitation for Blind Channel Estimation in Cyclic Prefix Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048028S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4253035,"authors":[{"name":"David Perels","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Perels","id":"37563081100"},{"name":"Christoph Studer","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Studer","id":"38575411500"},{"name":"W.

End-to-end simulations of a complete transistor-level implementation prove the concept under the effect of circuit nonidealities.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378360","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253049.pdf","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter using Random Demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Theory and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter using Random Demodulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253049/","publicationDate":"May 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9539270","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter using Random Demodulation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073133S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"249","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4253052,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

Because of weak coupling between implanted and external coils, obtaining high power efficiency is a challenge. Previous authors have addressed the issue of optimizing power efficiency in these systems. In this paper, we further this analysis for the case of planar spiral \"pancake\" coils at low RF frequencies (100 kHz -10 MHz). We consider practical design constraints such as component variation, power amplifier limitations, and coil voltage limits. We introduce a new, complete expression for total power link efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378508","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253079.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Efficient Inductive Power Links for Implantable Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Designing Efficient Inductive Power Links for Implantable Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253079/","publicationDate":"May 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9539320","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253079/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Efficient Inductive Power Links for Implantable Devices","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157697S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4253081,"authors":[{"name":"Sungchung Park","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungchung","lastName":"Park","id":"38184518500"},{"name":"Yun-Young Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37066725400"},{"name":"Jae-Ho Noh","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Ho","lastName":"Noh","id":"37701618200"},{"name":"Jun-Jin Kong","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Jin","lastName":"Kong","id":"37065228200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253081","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Noise reduction","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency diversity","Maximum likelihood decoding","Channel state information","Very large scale integration","OFDM modulation","Vectors","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI-aided demapping","dual-carrier modulation","multiband-OFDM","channel state information","soft decision values","log-likelihood ratio","Euclidean distances","channel estimation error","quantization noise","VLSI architecture","hardware complexity"]}],"abstract":"A novel CSI-aided demapping method for dual-carrier modulation (DCM) is proposed for multiband-OFDM systems. The proposed method utilizes the channel state information (CSI) to calculate the soft decision values, which are given by the approximate log-likelihood ratio (LLR). In this paper, it is shown that the soft decision values are given as the differences between two squared Euclidean distances. By reducing the noise-amplifying effect, the proposed method improves the error performance of conventional methods, by a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 3dB in the presence of channel estimation error and quantization noise. The VLSI architecture suitable for this method is also proposed, verifying that the performance gain comes with a slight increase of hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378510","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253081.pdf","startPage":"2088","endPage":"2091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSI-aided Demapping of Dual-Carrier Modulation for Multiband-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253081/","displayDocTitle":"CSI-aided Demapping of Dual-Carrier Modulation for Multiband-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253081/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI-aided Demapping of Dual-Carrier Modulation for Multiband-OFDM","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046463S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4253082,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37676219200"},{"name":"Ting-Chen Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Chen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37702170600"},{"name":"Shyh-Jye Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jye","lastName":"Jou","id":"37270102100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253082","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Cascading style sheets","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Hardware","Costs","Delay","Telecommunication standards","Baseband","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard interval detection","coarse symbol synchronization","DVB-T/H","nondata-aided broadcasting system","blind transmission mode","OFDM symbol parameters","normalized-maximum-correlation architecture","twister memory access scheme"]}],"abstract":"In a non-data-aided (NDA) broadcasting system such as DVB-T/H, blind transmission mode, guard interval (GI) length detection and coarse symbol synchronization (CSS) play important roles to estimate the transmitted OFDM symbol parameters and start the synchronization processes.

The decision-directed PLL is widely used carrier recovery technique for QPSK, which does not work for higher order QAMs. The reduced-constellation phase locked loop (RC-PLL) was proposed for the case of higher-order QAM. However, its performance in frequency offset detection still does not satisfy the system requirement especially when the offsets are large. In this paper, modified RC-PLL with tracking and hold algorithm (MRC-PLL) is proposed in order to improve the performance of RC-PLL in detecting phase offset as well as frequency offset in higher order QAM. Proposed MRC-PLL provides the acquisition range up to 45 degree phase offset and about up to 10 kHz frequency offset with the reduced acquisition time by half in comparison with RC-PLL.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253095.pdf","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2147","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Reduced Constellation PLL for Higher Order QAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Phase detection","Quadrature phase shift keying","Phase frequency detector","Communication cables","Filters","Degradation","Bit error rate","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loops","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified reduced constellation PLL","communication systems","high-order QAM modulation","decision-directed PLL","carrier recovery","QPSK","reduced-constellation phase locked loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modified Reduced Constellation PLL for Higher Order QAM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539388","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Reduced Constellation PLL for Higher Order QAM","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048758S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253101,"authors":[{"name":"Erhan Ozalevli","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Erhan","lastName":"Ozalevli","id":"37270013000"},{"name":"Walter Huang","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Huang","id":"37273207100"},{"name":"Paul Hasler","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Hasler","id":"37270054200"},{"name":"David V.

The value of compensation capacitors can thus be significantly reduced to widen the gain-bandwidth product and decrease the chip area while maintaining the stability of the amplifier.

The performance of this new approach is shown for low and high-order constellation schemes for different values of input backoff (IBO). The results reveal that, in low-IBO regimes, the SMC method shows a significant improvement, relative to the conventional methods where the predistorter is used before the amplifier, especially for high order constellations. Moreover, the SMC method is shown to have more robust behavior to the constellation scaling. Finally, an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo receiver is proposed that adapts itself efficiently to variations in amplifier parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253133.pdf","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2298","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Sequential Monte Carlo to M-QAM Schemes in the Presence of Nonlinear Solid-State Power Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Solid state circuits","Power amplifiers","Sliding mode control","High power amplifiers","Phase distortion","Operational amplifiers","Amplitude modulation","Nonlinear distortion","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation","receivers","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential Monte Carlo framework","nonlinear distortion","solid-state power amplifiers","M-QAM schemes","low constellation schemes","high-order constellation schemes","input backoff","predistorter","adaptive sequential Monte Carlo receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of Sequential Monte Carlo to M-QAM Schemes in the Presence of Nonlinear Solid-State Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253133/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518632","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Sequential Monte Carlo to M-QAM Schemes in the Presence of Nonlinear Solid-State Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04113S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253134,"authors":[{"name":"Ut-Va Koc","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ut-Va","lastName":"Koc","id":"37272601200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253134","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Optical fiber communication","Laser noise","Phase noise","Detection algorithms","Digital signal processing","Phase modulation","Digital modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","phase locked loops","quadrature amplitude modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLL","quadrature-amplitude modulation","coherent optical communication","phase synchronization","transmit laser","phase noise contributors","detection algorithm","digital signal processing techniques","12.5 MHz","100 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In similarity to its electronic counterpart, conventional coherent optical communication requires the difficult task of phase synchronization of a local laser with a transmit laser indiscriminately without regard of individual phase noise contributors.

A predistortion module is usually cascaded in front of the HPA to compensate these nonlinearities.

In order to achieve an autonomous system identification of the unknown predistorter structure, this paper presents an evolutionary algorithm based on genetic programming (GP).

The use of DBNS multiplier coefficients reduces the complexity and power consumption in the hardware implementation of the resulting FRM FIR digital filters. A direct application of GAs to the design of FRM FIR digital filters may result in chromosomes which do not conform to the DBNS format due to the underlying crossover and mutation operations. The proposed algorithm uses a DBNS based indexed look-up table (LUT) to ensure generation of valid DBNS multiplier coefficients through out the course of genetic optimization. An application example is given for the design of an FRM FIR lowpass digital filter. The resulting FIR digital filter outperforms a corresponding infinite-precision digital filter obtained by using the Parks-McClellan technique.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253142.pdf","startPage":"2331","endPage":"2334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of FRM Digital Filters over DBNS Multiplier Coefficient Space","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of FRM Digital Filters over DBNS Multiplier Coefficient Space","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518640","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253142/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Diversity Controlled Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of FRM Digital Filters over DBNS Multiplier Coefficient Space","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040149S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253147,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Abdelhalim","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Abdelhalim","id":"37269464200"},{"name":"Leonard MacEachern","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"MacEachern","id":"37269976500"},{"name":"Samy Mahmoud","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Samy","lastName":"Mahmoud","id":"37280825600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253147","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":919},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","MOSFETs","Voltage","Capacitors","CMOS process","CMOS technology","Biosensors","Capacitance","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Logic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","prosthetics","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanowatt successive approximation ADC","offset correction","implantable sensor applications","analog-to-digital converter","CMOS process technology","MOSFET","0.13 micron","0.35 V","4 V","8 bit"]}],"abstract":"An 8-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with offset correction circuitry is presented for implantable sensor applications.

This paper explores the suitability of such D-T receivers for highly flexible software-defined radio (SDR) receivers. Via symbolic analysis and simulations the authors analyze the properties of D-T receivers, and show that at least three challenges exist to make a D-T receiver work for SDR: 1) the sampling clock frequency is related to the radio frequency, complicating baseband filter design; 2) a frequency-dependent phase shift is introduced by pseudo-quadrature and pseudo-differential sampling; 3) the conversion gain of a charge sampling front-end is strongly frequency-dependent. Compared to a mixer based radio receiver, extra costs are needed to solve these problems.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378752","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253190.pdf","startPage":"2522","endPage":"2525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Suitability of Discrete-Time Receivers for Software-Defined Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253190/","displayDocTitle":"On the Suitability of Discrete-Time Receivers for Software-Defined Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539369","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253190/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Suitability of Discrete-Time Receivers for Software-Defined Radio","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043577S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253191,"authors":[{"name":"Faheem Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Faheem","lastName":"Sheikh","id":"37663950400"},{"name":"Shahid Masud","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Masud","id":"37270616400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253191","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Computer architecture","Transceivers","Iterative methods","Interpolation","Filtering","Iterative algorithms","Hardware","Resource management","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comb filters","iterative methods","software radio","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample rate conversion","software defined radio","multi-standard wireless transceivers","iterative factorization","Comb filters","Farrow interpolator","GSM","IS-95","UMTS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253191","abstract":"A modified architecture for rational sample rate conversion, in the digital IF stage of multi-standard wireless transceivers, has been developed.

The modulator accepts a single-ended microwave signal (2.4 GHz) and converts it to a balanced signal using an active balun. Complementary common-gate switches are then used to select one of the two balun outputs in correspondence with the digital data to produce BPSK modulation.

We simulated the performance degradation with FP for six transmission schemes, namely the Alamouti transmit diversity scheme, spatial multiplexing (SM) under maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, SM under ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) for (2 times 2) MIMO, orthogonal space-time block code (STBC), quasi-orthogonal STBC for (4 times 2) MIMO and interference cancellation with two (2 times 2) Alamouti scheme. We also provide a procedure to analyze roundoff errors in FP MIMO receivers and quantify the effective decision-point SNR. The quantified variance of accumulated quantization noise and decision-point SNR for FP Alamouti scheme corroborates the simulation result. Finally, we provide the minimum word-length precision requirements for these schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377847","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253209.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"2598","endPage":"2601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Word-length Precision on the Performance of MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Word-length Precision on the Performance of MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253209/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539420","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253209/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Word-length Precision on the Performance of MIMO Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057243S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253210,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hao Liao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hao","lastName":"Liao","id":"37399421400"},{"name":"To-Ping Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"To-Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291233100"},{"name":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzi-Dar","lastName":"Chiueh","id":"37273337000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253210","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Rayleigh channels","Hardware","Emulation","Real time systems","Baseband","Mathematical model","AWGN","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fader","real-time channel modeling","hardware implementation","real-time baseband channel emulation","MIMO channel emulation","low hardware complexity"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the algorithm and hardware implementation of a low hardware complexity Rayleigh faders designed for real-time baseband MIMO channel emulation.

Traditionally, systolic array-based QR decomposition (QRD) is used to invert large matrices. However, the matrices involved in MIMO baseband processing in mobile handsets are generally small which means QRD is not necessarily efficient. In this paper, a new method is proposed using programmable hardware units which not only achieves higher performance but also consumes less silicon area. Furthermore, the hardware can be reused for many other operations such as complex matrix multiplication, filtering, correlation and FFT/IFFT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Complex Matrix Inversion for MIMO Software Defined Radio","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377850","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253212.pdf","startPage":"2610","endPage":"2613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Complex Matrix Inversion for MIMO Software Defined Radio","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253212/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539427","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Complex Matrix Inversion for MIMO Software Defined Radio","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050798S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253213,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The resultant image is acquired by electronic means, with either a CCD camera or CMOS imagers. Observation of the fringe pattern gives information about a measurement. Examples of such measurements are displacement of an object, surface deformation, vibration, velocity, etc. Image analysis is required to read and interpret the underlying information conveyed in the fringe pattern.

A hardware design with either of the proposed wrappers can thus be swapped out of the partially reconfigurable logic at runtime in some intermediate state of computation and then swapped in when required to continue from that state. The context data is saved to a buffer in the wrapper at interruptible states, and then the wrapper takes care of saving the hardware context to communication memory through a peripheral bus, and later restoring the hardware context after the design is swapped in. The overheads of the hardware standardization and the wrapper in terms of additional reconfigurable logic resources and the time for context switching are small and generally acceptable. With the capability for dynamic swapping, high priority hardware tasks can interrupt low priority tasks in real-time embedded systems so that the utilization of hardware space per unit time is increased.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378620","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253245.pdf","startPage":"2742","endPage":"2745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Swappable Hardware Design in Partially Reconfigurable Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253245/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Swappable Hardware Design in Partially Reconfigurable Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539368","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253245/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Swappable Hardware Design in Partially Reconfigurable Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090664S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4253247,"authors":[{"name":"Yana Yankova","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yana","lastName":"Yankova","id":"37591196900"},{"name":"Koen Bertels","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Bertels","id":"37284722300"},{"name":"Stamatis Vassiliadis","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stamatis","lastName":"Vassiliadis","id":"37273396800"},{"name":"Roel Meeuws","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Meeuws","id":"37318247800"},{"name":"Arcilio Virginia","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Arcilio","lastName":"Virginia","id":"37691656800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253247","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware design languages","Software design","Application software","Testing","Design optimization","Sparks","Design automation","Laboratories","Software tools","High level languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","hardware description languages","high level languages","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated HDL generation","comparative evaluation","reconfigurable computing systems","general purpose processor","automated hardware generation"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable computing (RC) systems, coupling general purpose processor with reconfigurable components, offer a lot of advantages.

For regular LDPC codes, it is known that the normalized or offset min-sum decoding algorithm with quantization bits less than 6 bits achieves good performances over wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). However, finite precision effects in decoding irregular LDPC codes are different from that in decoding regular LDPC codes which is caused by the difference of convergence speeds between low degree nodes and high degree nodes. This paper proposes a novel method to improve the performance of the conventional normalized or offset min-sum decoding algorithm when it is approximated with finite precision for hardware implementations. The proposed method applies down-scaling factors to intrinsic information which has effects on increasing the reliability of extrinsic information at variable nodes and compensating the quantization errors caused by finite precision. Computer simulation results for irregular LDPC codes show that the proposed normalized and offset min-sum decoding algorithms achieve better performances at high SNR compared to the conventional normalized and offset min-sum algorithms under (6:2) quantization scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253249/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9539372","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Quantized Min-Sum Decoding Algorithms for Irregular LDPC Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Quantized Min-Sum Decoding Algorithms for Irregular LDPC Codes","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044064S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4253250,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Nougarou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Nougarou","id":"37601607800"},{"name":"Daniel Massicotte","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Massicotte","id":"37284131800"},{"name":"Messaoud Ahmed-Ouameur","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Messaoud","lastName":"Ahmed-Ouameur","id":"38276586200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253250","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Field programmable gate arrays","Multiuser detection","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Very large scale integration","Hardware","Interference constraints","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","adaptive filters","code division multiple access","field programmable gate arrays","interference suppression","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive duplicated filters","interference canceller","DS-CDMA systems","FPGA","field programmable gate array","multiuser detection methods","3G cellular network","WCDMA constraints"]}],"abstract":"Many multiuser detection (MUD) methods are proposed in the literature to increase the performance of 3G cellular networks.

Raising the source voltage of SRAM cells in standby mode reduces the leakage currents effectively. However, in order to preserve the state of the cell in standby mode, source voltage cannot be raised beyond a certain level. The maximum source voltage of an SRAM cell is determined by its hold stability in a particular process corner. Hence, in order to achieve the maximum leakage reduction, the source voltage of each individual cell must be raised up to its maximum safe level. However, any cell-based technique realizing this would be practically not feasible. In this paper, we propose an SRAM leakage reduction technique, referred to as adaptive sleep transistor biasing, which automatically fine-tunes the source voltage of individual memory blocks to their optimum level. Thus, maximum leakage savings can be expected while data is safely retained during standby mode. Preliminary study shows that the proposed scheme has the potential of providing substantial saving in leakage power over those by using the conventional techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Sleep Transistor Biasing Scheme for Low Leakage SRAM","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378632","startPage":"2790","endPage":"2793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253257.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Sleep Transistor Biasing Scheme for Low Leakage SRAM","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253257/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518751","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Sleep Transistor Biasing Scheme for Low Leakage SRAM","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064069S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253260,"authors":[{"name":"Chyuen-Wei Ang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore","National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chyuen-Wei","lastName":"Ang","id":"37401128300"},{"name":"Yuanjin Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yuanjin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37281046000"},{"name":"Chun-Huat Heng","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chun-Huat","lastName":"Heng","id":"37273015300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253260","dbTime":"57 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":812},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Circuit noise","Broadband amplifiers","CMOS technology","Noise measurement","Noise figure","Signal design","Circuit topology","Wideband","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","notch filters","radio receivers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low noise amplifier","wireless receivers","circuit topology","wideband LNA","notch filters","figure of merit","noise figure","power consumption trade-offs","0.935 to 5.825 GHz","8 dB","15 to 24 dB","4.4 to 4.78 dB","0.18 micron"]}],"abstract":"A novel multi-band low noise amplifier (LNA) that allows simultaneous reception of signals from several wireless standards is designed and implemented using a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology.

We present analytical design equations in this paper for Class-E power amplifier taking into account both finite drain inductance and switch on-resistance. The analysis indicates the existence of infinitely many design equations; conclusions include: 1) Class-E conditions (e.g. zero voltage and zero slope) can be satisfied in the presence of switch-on

Conversion of photodiode voltage to output current is done using transistors operating in velocity saturation region. The high output impedance of this region makes it more suitable for current-sourcing operation than the linear region. The transistors also exhibit high linearity, allowing us to suppress fixed pattern noise (FPN) by correcting for both offset and gain variations among pixels. Experimental results on the fabricated 110times200 pixel array are presented. With conventional correlated double sampling (CDS), FPN is reduced from 3.8% to 0.85%. Further reduction requires compensation of gain variations, and results in a final FPN of 0.19%. A triple sampling approach is introduced to implement the described correction in hardware.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378764","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253270.pdf","startPage":"2842","endPage":"2845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Fixed Pattern Noise Current-mode Imager Using Velocity Saturated Readout Transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low Fixed Pattern Noise Current-mode Imager Using Velocity Saturated Readout Transistors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539598","htmlLink":"/document/4253270/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Fixed Pattern Noise Current-mode Imager Using Velocity Saturated Readout Transistors","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066066S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4253271,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Gruev","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Gruev","id":"37269503900"},{"name":"Zheng Yang","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37676937900"},{"name":"Jan Van der Spiegel","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Van der Spiegel","id":"37284390100"},{"name":"Ralph Etienne-Cummings","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Etienne-Cummings","id":"38271387300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253271","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Switches","Linearity","Pixel","High-resolution imaging","Photodiodes","Transconductance","Photoconductivity","Image sampling","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","current-mode circuits","image sensors","imaging","photodiodes","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current mode active pixel sensor","high resolution imaging","photo pixel","photodiode","transconductance amplifier transistor","switch transistor","photocurrent","image sensor","spatial variations","fix pattern noise","temporal noise limitations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253271","abstract":"A novel current mode active pixel sensor for high resolution imaging is presented.

To solve the bottleneck of memory bandwidth for H.264/AVC HD applications, three combined bandwidth optimization strategies are proposed to minimize the memory bandwidth for MB-based decoding. To improve the interpolation hardware utilization and reduce the interpolation cycles, an interpolation classification scheme is proposed. By classifying the fifteen fractional pixels into five types and processed correspondingly, the interpolation cycles decrease significantly. A direct mapping memory cache characterized with circular addressing, byte-aligned addressing and horizontal and vertical parallel access is designed to support the proposed scheme. Averagely 60-80% reduced memory bandwidth can be offered and the interpolation hardware can be fully utilized and interpolate one MB within 304 cycles, which can satisfy the real time constraint for H.264/AVC HD (1920times1088) 30fps decoder with 32K logic gates, operating at 100MHz.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377857","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Cache Based Motion Compensation Architecture for HDTV H.264/AVC Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory Cache Based Motion Compensation Architecture for HDTV H.264/AVC Decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253286/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518760","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253286/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Cache Based Motion Compensation Architecture for HDTV H.264/AVC Decoder","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056179S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253287,"authors":[{"name":"Dajiang Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403106700"},{"name":"Peilin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peilin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402099000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253287","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Interpolation","Decoding","Costs","Video coding","Standards development","Finite impulse response filter","Pipelines","Streaming media","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","interpolation","motion compensation","video codecs","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-efficient dual-standard VLSI architecture","MC interpolation","AVS standard","H.264 standard","video coding standards","dual-mode VLSI decoder","reconfigurable FIR filters","adaptive pipeline strategy","real-time video streams"]}],"abstract":"H.264 and AVS are the two latest video coding standards.

Previous evaluations of convolutive blind source separation methods for speech enhancement have considered situations where the signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) of all the talkers' speech signals are nearly equal in the recorded signal mixtures. This paper presents real-world separation experiments of two- and three-talker signal mixtures in which the level of one talker's speech is lower than those of the others. Methods based on decorrelation, frequency-domain information maximization, and time-domain contrast optimization are studied. Experimental evaluation shows that the weaker talker's speech receives the most enhancement in the separated system's outputs, whereas the stronger talker's speech signals receive moderate to little enhancement beyond a limiting value.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253304.pdf","startPage":"2978","endPage":"2981","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Convolutive Blind Source Separation of Mixtures of Unequal-Level Speech Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Speech analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Speech enhancement","Decorrelation","Dispersion","Telephony","Acoustic testing","Interference","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","decorrelation","optimisation","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutive blind source separation","unequal-level speech signals","signal enhancement","signal-to-interference ratios","recorded signal mixtures","decorrelation method","frequency-domain information maximization","time-domain contrast optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Convolutive Blind Source Separation of Mixtures of Unequal-Level Speech Signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539481","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Convolutive Blind Source Separation of Mixtures of Unequal-Level Speech Signals","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045889S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4253310,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The 1K-bit PRAM test chip with 128\u00d78bits is implemented with a 0.8\u03bcm CMOS technology with a 0.5\u03bcm GST cell.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377981","startPage":"3014","endPage":"3017","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253313.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Power Phase-Change Random Access Memory using a Data-Comparison Write Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253313/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Low Power Phase-Change Random Access Memory using a Data-Comparison Write Scheme","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9539492","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253313/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Power Phase-Change Random Access Memory using a Data-Comparison Write Scheme","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046671S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4253314,"authors":[{"name":"Jungseob Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Jungseob","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065076400"},{"name":"Azadeh Davoodi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Davoodi","id":"37285021400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253314","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delay","Threshold voltage","Process design","Probability density function","Fluctuations","Robustness","Stability analysis","Leakage current","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","logic design","low-power electronics","Monte Carlo methods","probability","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-Vt configurations","SRAM cell","process-induced variations","dual threshold voltage assignment","leakage power reduction","process parameter variations","deca-nanometer designs","probability density functions","read delay","leakage current","read stability","Monte Carlo simulations","90 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253314","abstract":"This paper is a case study of dual-14 configurations of an SRAM cell considering process-induced V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n variations.

We prioritize on how well and efficiently code could be actually implemented and propose high speed, minimal area, and low power SEC code for DRAMs with large I/O data widths. The proposed code minimizes the column weight, row weight and total weight of the H-matrix. Consequently, the area overhead and power consumption of the check bit generator are reduced by 17.7% at the most. The propagation delay is also decreased by reducing the level of XOR trees. Moreover, maximal power reduction is possible as the optimal H-matrix variants can be formulated to specifically tailor for various system applications with different spatial and temporal data correlations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Speed, Minimal Area, and Low Power SEC Code for DRAMs with Large I/O Data Widths","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377984","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253316.pdf","startPage":"3026","endPage":"3029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.377984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"High Speed, Minimal Area, and Low Power SEC Code for DRAMs with Large I/O Data Widths","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253316/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518773","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Speed, Minimal Area, and Low Power SEC Code for DRAMs with Large I/O Data Widths","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054039S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4253317,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Patil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Patil","id":"37692985500"},{"name":"Michael Wieckowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wieckowski","id":"37281691400"},{"name":"Martin Margala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Margala","id":"37271535300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253317","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":678},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Charge transfer","Latches","Random access memory","Integrated circuit interconnections","Multiplexing","Threshold voltage","Application software","Costs","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","charge-coupled devices","flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-biased charge-transfer sense amplifier","high performance static memory","internal biasing mechanism","static output latch","input capacitance mismatch"]}],"abstract":"A self-biased charge-transfer sense amplifier (SB-CTSA) is proposed for applications in high performance static memory.

Using a multirate DSP approach, we introduce a new discrete time transceiver that i) generalizes and unifies previous work, ii) gives a complete solution to the L/M fractionally spaced receiver and the periodic non-uniformly spaced one and iii) provides new insight by relating the obtained solutions to the so-called polyphase components of the channel.

To realize the area-efficient and high speed MAC unit proposed in this work, first we examine the critical delays and hardware complexities of conventional MAC architectures to derive at a unit with low critical delay and low hardware complexity. The new architecture is based on binary trees constructed using a modified 4:2 compressor circuits. Reducing the overall area is achieved by the full utilization of the compressors instead of putting zeros in free inputs. Increasing the speed of operation is achieved by avoid using the modified compressor in the critical path. Feeding the bits of the accumulated operand into the summation tree before the final adder helps to increase the speed too. The proposed MAC unit and the previous merged MAC unit are mapped on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip, in order to compare between them. The simulation result shows that the proposed system for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit MAC unit reduces area by 6.25%, 3.2 %, and 2.5% and increases the speed by 14%, 16%, and 19% respectively.

The filter is designed to meet the constraints of channel equalization for fixed wireless communications that typically requires a large number of taps, but a serial updating of the filter coefficients, based on the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, is allowed. Previous work showed that the use of the residue number system (RNS) for the variable FIR filter grants advantages both in area and power consumption. On the other hand, the use of a binary serial implementation of the adaptation algorithm eliminates the need for complex scaling circuits in RNS. The advantages in terms of area and speed of the presented filter, with respect to its two's complement counterpart, are evaluated for implementations in standard cells.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378155","startPage":"3211","endPage":"3214","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253362.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power adaptive filter based on RNS components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Finite impulse response filter","Least squares approximation","Energy consumption","Signal processing algorithms","Circuits","Matched filters","Adaptive algorithm","Radio frequency","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","equalisers","FIR filters","least squares approximations","low-power electronics","residue number systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power adaptive filter","RNS components","adaptive FIR filter","channel equalization","fixed wireless communications","least mean squares","residue number system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low-power adaptive filter based on RNS components","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253362/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539529","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power adaptive filter based on RNS components","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060685S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253364,"authors":[{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"},{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Nieuwoudt","id":"37299372300"},{"name":"Tamer Ragheb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ragheb","id":"37299375200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253364","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Optimization methods","Wideband","Integrated circuit synthesis","Impedance matching","Coupling circuits","Design optimization","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","impedance matching","low noise amplifiers","network synthesis","optimisation","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variability-aware synthesis","systematic synthesis","fully integrated wideband low noise amplifiers","impedance matching","noise figure","wideband model","global optimization","convex optimization","statistical process variations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253364","abstract":"In this paper, we present a systematic synthesis methodology for fully integrated wideband low noise amplifiers (LNA) that simultaneously optimizes impedance matching, noise figure, and other performance parameters.

Yet the extension is nontrivial, since the formulation of the MIMO-OFDM signal and the related blind constraint cannot easily be obtained from the MIMO counterpart.

Conventionally, the correlation coefficient of separated signal envelopes is calculated to judge whether or not the separated signals originate from the same source. In this paper, we propose a new measure that represents the dominance of the separated signal in the mixtures, and use it for calculating the correlation coefficient, instead of a signal envelope. Such dominance measures exhibit dependence/independence more clearly than traditionally used signal envelopes. Consequently, a simple clustering algorithm with centroids works well for grouping separated signals. Experimental results were very appealing, as three sources including two coming from the same direction were separated properly with the new method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"3247","endPage":"3250","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253371.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring Dependence of Bin-wise Separated Signals for Permutation Alignment in Frequency-domain BSS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253371/","displayDocTitle":"Measuring Dependence of Bin-wise Separated Signals for Permutation Alignment in Frequency-domain BSS","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539533","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring Dependence of Bin-wise Separated Signals for Permutation Alignment in Frequency-domain BSS","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068794S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4253379,"authors":[{"name":"Viral K.

The conventional band-pass \u03a3\u0394 structures required to achieve such noise shaping are hardware intensive and do not meet the timing requirements when synthesized in 90nm technology using a static CMOS implementation. The loop-unrolling concept was recently presented as a solution for getting required rate of operation. However, this approach requires larger area and consumes higher power. In this work, we present a new architecture to achieve the necessary noise shaping at required rate of operation. The proposed structure has the different Noise Transfer Function (NTF) compared to conventional band-pass structures and hence it gives more control over the location of zeros. It also meets timing requirements of 900 MHz across all PVT corners and shows significant saving in area and power.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"3279","endPage":"3282","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253379.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253379","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Digital modulation","Transmitters","Noise shaping","Timing","Data conversion","Quantization","Hardware","CMOS technology","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","radio transmitters","sigma-delta modulation","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital band-pass sigma-delta modulator","wireless transmitters","CMOS wireless SoC","high-resolution data conversion","quantization noise","noise shaping","loop-unrolling concept","noise transfer function","sigma-delta dithering","900 MHz","90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sigma-delta modulator","comb NTF","sigma-delta dithering","low power","wireless","DRP","EDGE","SAW filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Low Area and Low Power Digital Band-Pass Sigma-Delta Modulator for Wireless Transmitters","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518885","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253379/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253379/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Area and Low Power Digital Band-Pass Sigma-Delta Modulator for Wireless Transmitters","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050642S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4253392,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Shepherd","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Shepherd","id":"37427679100"},{"name":"Pantelis Georgiou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Pantelis","lastName":"Georgiou","id":"37302145800"},{"name":"Chris Toumazou","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Toumazou","id":"37271540100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253392","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":125,"totalDownloads":1254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Threshold voltage","Biomedical engineering","Educational institutions","Clamps","Circuit topology","Energy consumption","MOSFET circuits","Sensor arrays","Insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","ion sensitive field effect transistors","peripheral interfaces","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISFET sensor interface","ion-sensitive field effect transistors","voltage clamping","strong inversion operation","weak inversion operation","pseudodifferential ISFET-REFET topology","on-chip reference electrode","UMC CMOS technology","1 nA","0.185 mW","13 nW","0.25 micron","1.5 V","2.5 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253392","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253392.pdf","startPage":"3331","endPage":"3334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel voltage-clamped CMOS ISFET sensor interface","abstract":"This paper presents a novel interface for ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFET) in which operation at a fixed electrical bias is achieved by voltage clamping.

As a drawback of such converters, mismatches between the channels impair their performance, e.g., the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). One characteristic that varies among all channels is the magnitude response. The authors proposed a method to compensate magnitude response mismatches in two-channel TI-ADCs. In this paper the authors extend this method to an arbitrary number of channels, discuss a possible implementation, and evaluate its performance.

Previous blind equalization algorithms based on subspace decomposition and LP methods have problems when the channel order is under/over estimated. Previous subspace based algorithms exhibit significantly higher residual output mean square error if the estimation of channel length is off even by one, (Tong et al., 1994), (Li and Fan, 2000). In a practically noisy environment, accurate rank determination may be difficult. Even the linear prediction algorithms (Slock, 1994), (Liavas et al., 2000) are not robust to order over-estimation because solving the Yule Walker equation requires the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the noise free correlation matrix, for which the theoretical rank of the noise-free correlation matrix needs to be known. If the channel order is over-estimated, some of the small eigen-values (corresponding to noise) are erroneously classified in the signal subspace and are then inverted, and the LP algorithms exhibit large mean square errors (Liavas et al., 2000). In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid linear prediction and subspace based blind equalization algorithm. The superior performance of subspace based methods in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is thus integrated into our method. Our algorithm is robust to channel order under/over estimation. Our algorithm is a data based (as opposed to channel based) algorithm and avoids effects of channel estimation errors. Simulations clearly indicate that our algorithm performs very well under channel order under/over-estimation, when LP and subspace based blind equalizers fail.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","startPage":"3479","endPage":"3482","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253429.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Linear Prediction and Subspace Based Blind Equalizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253429/","displayDocTitle":"Combined Linear Prediction and Subspace Based Blind Equalizers","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539491","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Linear Prediction and Subspace Based Blind Equalizers","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077198S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4253431,"authors":[{"name":"Mitsuru Kawamoto","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Kawamoto","id":"37266564800"},{"name":"Kiyotaka Kohno","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Control Systems Engineering, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Kohno","id":"37266572100"},{"name":"Yujiro Inouye","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Control Systems Engineering, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan"],"firstName":"Yujiro","lastName":"Inouye","id":"37266573300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253431","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","MIMO","Source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Blind source separation","Electrical equipment industry","Electronics industry","Industrial control","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","deconvolution","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","IIR filters","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvector algorithms","blind deconvolution","MIMO-IIR systems","multiple input multiple output infinite impulse response","convolutive mixtures","reference signals"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents eigenvector algorithms (EVAs) for blind deconvolution (BD) of multiple-input multiple-output infinite impulse response (MIMO-IIR) channels (convolutive mixtures).

For this kind of application a base-station transmitter operating with a single analog up-conversion path shared by all WCDMA channels represents an attractive solution. In particular sharing a single power amplifier (PA) can largely reduce the costs of a base station. The M-carrier WCDMA signal has on the other hand the disadvantage of a large peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Efficient transmission of such wide band signals is limited by the non-linearity of the PA which causes interference within and outside the signal band. Without any measures this interference can be reduced only with a sufficient back off of the PA input. In order to achieve a better efficiency in the PA, in addition to pre-distortion methods, the signal PAPR should be reduced. This work proposes an algorithm which limits the PAPR without introducing additional out of band emission. Simulations for the WCDMA downlink signal for the case of a 3-carrier base-station indicates that the PAPR can be reduced by 4 dB ensuring still a secure margin on the maximum distortion allowed by the standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technique for Peak to Average Power Ratio Reduction suited for M-carrier WCDMA Base Station Transmitters","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378442","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253440.pdf","startPage":"3522","endPage":"3525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Technique for Peak to Average Power Ratio Reduction suited for M-carrier WCDMA Base Station Transmitters","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253440/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539526","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technique for Peak to Average Power Ratio Reduction suited for M-carrier WCDMA Base Station Transmitters","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077223S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4253441,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A corresponding VLSI implementation provides reference for the true silicon complexity and for the complexity increase associated with the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378444","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253442.pdf","startPage":"3530","endPage":"3533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Frequency Domain Equalization Algorithm and its VLSI Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253442/","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Frequency Domain Equalization Algorithm and its VLSI Implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9539532","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253442/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Frequency Domain Equalization Algorithm and its VLSI Implementation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053634S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253450,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Mason","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Mason","id":"37265591100"},{"name":"Yue Huang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291620000"},{"name":"Chao Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291793900"},{"name":"Jichun Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jichun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37337405500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253450","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Electrodes","Biosensors","Semiconductor device measurement","Proteins","Current measurement","Integrated circuit measurements","Voltage","Signal resolution","Nanobioscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amperometric sensors","biosensors","CMOS integrated circuits","digital readout","electrodes","voltammetry (chemical analysis)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amperometric readout","electrode array chip","bioelectrochemical sensors","nanostructured bioelectronic interfaces","bioelectrochemical measurements","CMOS potentiostat","on-chip chronoamperometry","cyclic voltammetry assays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253450","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253450.pdf","startPage":"3562","endPage":"3565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amperometric Readout and Electrode Array Chip for Bioelectrochemical Sensors","abstract":"As nanostructured bioelectronic interfaces continue to evolve for sensor applications, new readout circuits are needed to harness their capabilities.

The compression rate is increased by more than 40% and the design area is decreased by more than 30%. The effect of the selected buffer's size on the compression ratio is analyzed.

This is done by enabling routing resource sharing between different types: (1) long interconnects can be constructed with short bypass interconnects without sacrificing delay performance. (2) switch boxes and connection boxes both are embedded in the switching core of the routing modules. Therefore routing resources such as MUXs can be shared between them on a per-mapping basis. (3) the switching core in CRA can dynamically extend its switching capability, whereas in a conventional switch box, switch matrix is predetermined and therefore static. These architectural features demonstrate significant performance improvements. Using the same logic placement, the CRA yields about 25% reduction in the minimum routing channel width, 20% improvement in overall delay performance for 20 largest MCNC benchmark circuits, when compared with a Virtex-II style baseline FPGA.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253484.pdf","startPage":"3700","endPage":"3703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378646","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Routing Architecture for FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Routing Architecture for FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253484/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4253484/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518840","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Routing Architecture for FPGA","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052279S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253485,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Farrugia","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Meylan, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Farrugia","id":"37692078600"},{"name":"Franck Mamalet","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Meylan, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Mamalet","id":"37331859300"},{"name":"Sebastien Roux","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Meylan, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Roux","id":"37529520800"},{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["Laboratoire LE2I, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538164900"},{"name":"Michel Paindavoine","affiliation":["Laboratoire LE2I, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Paindavoine","id":"37273346400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0920-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0921-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"4253485","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Space exploration","Convolutional codes","Parallel architectures","Software algorithms","Neural networks","Hardware","Design methodology","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","face recognition","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face detection system","FPGA","convolutional face finder algorithm","parallel architecture","architecture algorithm adequation methodology","SynDEx software","processor element","algorithm parallelization","DSP48 dedicated blocks","Virtex 4 SX35 device","352 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a methodology for designing a system for face detection and its implementation on FPGA.

To speed up the operation, the Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm is employed to eliminate the trial division, and the carry-save addition is used to alleviate the carry propagation delay. In this paper, we propose a unified Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm that can be applied to fulfil either the conventional modular multiplication or squaring operation in carry-save form so as to achieve area-efficient design of modular exponentiation. Meanwhile, we reduce the number of input operands for carry-save addition by mathematical manipulation to minimize the resulting critical path delay. Compared with the existing works, our modular exponentiation design obtains the least hardware complexity and outperforms them in terms of area-time (AT) complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007

To achieve this goal, we propose a method to calculate the rate of innovation (RI) of signals in the Hilbert space. The RI is then used to identify a suitable sampling kernel as well as the sampling rate for a specific signal. We show that the RI of the kernel should be greater or equal to the RI of the signal for the signal to be perfectly reconstructible. The minimum sampling rate depends on the RI of the signal. Examples are included to demonstrate how our method is applied to calculate the RI. Some known sampling theories can also be fitted into the framework of sampling system with minimum sampling rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Kernel","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Space technology","Hilbert space","Signal design","Technological innovation","Design engineering","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hilbert spaces","interpolation","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum sampling rate","sampling system","shift invariant Hilbert space","rate of innovation","signal reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378796","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4252534/4252535/04253560.pdf","startPage":"4004","endPage":"4007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4252535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling at Minimum Sampling Rate for Signals in Shift Invariant Spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling at Minimum Sampling Rate for Signals in Shift Invariant Spaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253560/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253560/","accessionNumber":"9539679","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling at Minimum Sampling Rate for Signals in Shift Invariant Spaces","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISCAS-00-1025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097423S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4252534","isNumber":"4252535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4252534","xplore-issue":"4252535","articleId":"4253560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4253570,"authors":[{"name":"Jiejun Kong","affiliation":["Scalable Network Technologies, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiejun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37277189000"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Hong","id":"37289739700"},{"name":"Mario Gerla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gerla","id":"37269066800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"4253570","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks","Privacy","Reconnaissance","Wireless communication","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Mobile communication","Protection","Communication system security","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","routing protocols","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity-free routing scheme","on-demand routing scheme","anonymity threats","mobile ad hoc networks","node mobility","mobile wireless security research","network complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anonymity","identity-free routing","negligibility","ad hoc network","network complexity theory."]}],"abstract":"Introducing node mobility into the network also introduces new anonymity threats.

To realize the DTN vision, routes must be found over multiple unreliable, intermittently-connected hops. In this paper we present a practical routing protocol that uses only observed information about the network. We designed a metric that estimates the average waiting time for each potential next hop. This learned topology information is distributed using a link-state routing protocol, where the link-state packets are \"flooded\" using epidemic routing. The routing is recomputed each time connections are established, allowing messages to take advantage of unpredictable contacts. A message is forwarded if the topology suggests that the connected node is \"closer\" to the destination than the current node. We demonstrate through simulation that our protocol provides performance similar to that of schemes that have global knowledge of the network topology, yet without requiring that knowledge. Further, it requires significantly less resources than the alternative, epidemic routing, suggesting that our approach scales better with the number of messages in the network. This performance is achieved with minimal protocol overhead for networks of approximately 100 nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.1016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4253565/04253574.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.1016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4253565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4253574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4253574/","displayDocTitle":"Practical Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks","volume":"6","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9621299","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4253574/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"h0943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072101S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4253565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4253565","articleId":"4253574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4257432,"authors":[{"name":"Ganlin Ye","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communications Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ganlin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37688660200"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communications Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li","id":"37598891200"},{"name":"Aiping Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communications Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275718700"},{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Hwa","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281172400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4257432","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference","Autocorrelation","Multipath channels","Propagation delay","Delay effects","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","m-sequences","sequential codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZCZ code","m-sequences","CDMA systems","zero-correlation zone code","auto-correlation function","cross-correlation function","interference-resist capability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) code, called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n-ZCZ code.

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the interleave- division multiple-access (IDMA) scheme in the block error rate even for severely frequency-selective channel, while providing considerably lower computational complexity.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4257430/04257434.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4257430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2007.070063","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2007.070063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4257434","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Frequency modulation","Interleaved codes","Transmitters","Interference","Iterative methods","Frequency domain analysis","Computational modeling","Error analysis","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","iterative methods","multi-access systems","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-selective channel","block error rate","iterative detection method","multiuser interference","user-specific interleaving","frequency-domain equalization","single-carrier modulation","iterative multiuser detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4257434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Multiuser Detection for Single-Carrier Modulation with Frequency-Domain Equalization","accessionNumber":"9689779","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4257434/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Multiuser Detection for Single-Carrier Modulation with Frequency-Domain Equalization","sourcePdf":"cl_0706_471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044975S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4257430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4257430","articleId":"4257434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4257435,"authors":[{"name":"Seungjae Bahng","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunications Research Division, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjae","lastName":"Bahng","id":"37284779200"},{"name":"Seokjoo Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokjoo","lastName":"Shin","id":"37067029000"},{"name":"Youn-Ok Park","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunications Research Division, Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youn-Ok","lastName":"Park","id":"37293570500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4257435","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detection algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Detectors","Interference cancellation","Phase shift keying","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel","multiple input multiple output systems","maximum likelihood method","orthogonal projection","MIMO Detection"]}],"abstract":"A detection algorithm for spatially multiplexed multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems is proposed.

In order for the BS to obtain the CSI of the distant link (i.e. RS-MS link), RS amplifies a pilot signal received from MS with a pre-defined amplification factor, and forwards it to BS.

Based on this model, a simpler model is proposed to facilitate the calibration and correction of FPN. To avoid nonlinear optimization, the variation of photodiode leakage current from one pixel to another is neglected. The simplified model uses the dark response of pixels, which depends only on temperature, to help predict FPN in the light response, which depends on temperature and illuminance. Calibration requires images of a uniform stimulus taken at different temperatures and illuminances, which need not be measured. After calibration, FPN is corrected in an arbitrary image using a dark image at the same temperature, which is taken infrequently. Through simulation, using mismatch data from a real CMOS process, an improvement is shown in the residual error per image after calibration, when the proposed method is compared to an established method that does not account for temperature dependence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Dependence of Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379019","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Dependence of Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258059/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9718197","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Dependence of Fixed Pattern Noise in Logarithmic CMOS Image Sensors","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083888S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258070,"authors":[{"name":"Leopoldo Angrisani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di InformaticaSistemistica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italia"],"firstName":"Leopoldo","lastName":"Angrisani","id":"37274884900"},{"name":"Mauro D'Arco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italia"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"D'Arco","id":"37274880100"},{"name":"Charles Greenhall","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory (CIT), Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Greenhall","id":"37372581300"},{"name":"Rosario Schiano Lo Moriello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di InformaticaSistemistica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italia"],"firstName":"Rosario Schiano Lo","lastName":"Moriello","id":"37273785500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258070","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"abstract":"Measurement of phase noise affecting oscillators or clocks is a fundamental practice whenever the need of a reliable time-base is of primary concern. In spite of the number of methods or techniques either available in literature or implemented as personalities in general purpose equipment, very accurate measurement results can be gained only from expensive, dedicated instruments. To offer a cost-effective alternative to dedicated instruments, the authors have already realized a DSP-based phase noise meter, capable of assuring high performance and real-time operation. The meter, however, suffers from a reduced analysis bandwidth (about 250 kHz) and needs an external time-base for input signal digitization. To overcome these drawbacks, the authors propose hereinafter the adoption both of bandpass sampling strategies and internal time-base. After some remarks on the previous version of the meter, key features of the adopted time-base and proposed sampling strategy are described in detail. Results of experimental tests, carried out on sinusoidal signals provided both by function and arbitrary waveform generators, are presented and discussed; evidence of the meter's reliability and efficacy is finally given.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Phase noise","Sampling methods","Instruments","Noise measurement","Phase measurement","Oscillators","Clocks","Gain measurement","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","noise measurement","oscillators","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input frequency range","phase noise meter","bandpass sampling","quadrature demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase noise measurement","phase noise meter","quadrature demodulation","bandpass sampling","bandwidth enlargement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379066","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enlarging the Input Frequency Range of a Phase Noise Meter through Bandpass Sampling Strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enlarging the Input Frequency Range of a Phase Noise Meter through Bandpass Sampling Strategies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258070/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258070/","accessionNumber":"9718221","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enlarging the Input Frequency Range of a Phase Noise Meter through Bandpass Sampling Strategies","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059796S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258091,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We show that outlier removal almost always improves modeling capabilities of considered techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379222","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258091.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of the Influence of Methods for Outliers Detection on the Performance of Data Driven Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of the Influence of Methods for Outliers Detection on the Performance of Data Driven Models","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4258091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9718099","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Analysis of the Influence of Methods for Outliers Detection on the Performance of Data Driven Models","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098253S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4258110,"authors":[{"name":"Rini Akmeliawati","affiliation":["Monash University, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rini","lastName":"Akmeliawati","id":"37296098000"},{"name":"Melanie Po-Leen Ooi","affiliation":["Monash University, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Melanie Po-Leen","lastName":"Ooi","id":"37403128000"},{"name":"Ye Chow Kuang","affiliation":["Monash University, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ye Chow","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37296760200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258110","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258110","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handicapped aids","Neural networks","Natural languages","Deafness","Real time systems","Cameras","Instrumentation and measurement","Signal processing","Torso","Auditory system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","handicapped aids","image colour analysis","image segmentation","language translation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time Malaysian sign language translation","colour segmentation","neural network","automatic visual-based sign language translation system","real-time English translation","sign language recognition","fingerspelling","sign gestures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","sign language","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379311","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Malaysian Sign Language Translation using Colour Segmentation and Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper we present an automatic visual-based sign language translation system.

On the first place, however, this technology gives the designer the possibility to increase efficiency of designed system by exploitation of parallelisms of implemented algorithms. Moreover, it is possible to apply special techniques, such as distributed arithmetic (DA). Since in this approach general purpose multipliers are replaced by combinational LUT blocks, it is possible to construct digital filters of very high performance. However LUT blocks can be of considerable size thus advanced synthesis methods have to be used to map them efficiently into FPGA resources. In this paper an application of the functional decomposition based synthesis in implementation of digital filters for wavelet transform has been investigated. The paper presents many examples confirming that decomposition allows reducing logic cell utilisation of filter implementation based on distributed arithmetic concept with no performance degradation and even increasing it.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379362","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258121.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition-Based Synthesis in Implementation of Digital Filters for Wavelet Transform Application Targeted FPGA Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Decomposition-Based Synthesis in Implementation of Digital Filters for Wavelet Transform Application Targeted FPGA Devices","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258121/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9717890","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition-Based Synthesis in Implementation of Digital Filters for Wavelet Transform Application Targeted FPGA Devices","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039315S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258122,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Barford","affiliation":["Agilent Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lee Barford","id":"37087021117"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258122","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"abstract":"The emerging availability of precision time synchronization, such as that provided by IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, make it desirable to have signal processing methods available for signals that are sampled at non-uniform intervals but have the sample times accurately recorded, or time-stamped.

DNA microarray technologies are an essential part of modern biomedical research. The analysis of DNA microarray images allows the identification of gene expressions in order to draw biologically meaningful conclusions for applications that ranges from the genetic profiling to the diagnosis of oncology diseases. Unfortunately, DNA microarray technology has a high variation of data quality. Therefore, in order to obtain reliable results, complex and extensive image analysis algorithms should be applied before actual DNA microarray information can be used for biomedical purpose. In this paper, we present a novel hardware acceleration architecture specifically designed to process and measure DNA microarray images. The proposed architecture uses several units working in a single instruction-multiple data fashion managed by a microprocessor core. An FPGA-based prototypal implementation of the developed architecture is presented. Experimental results on several realistic DNA microarray images show a reduction of the computation time of one order of magnitude if compared with previously developed software-based approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258145.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new FPGA-based edge detection system for the gridding of DNA microarray images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","DNA","Computer architecture","Microscopy","Solids","Glass","Plastics","Silicon","Image analysis","Gene expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA","edge detection","field programmable gate arrays","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based edge detection system","DNA microarray images gridding","deoxyribonucleic acid microarray","microscopic DNA spots","gene expressions","genetic profiling","oncology disease diagnosis","image analysis algorithms","hardware acceleration architecture","biomedical research"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA microarray","image data-processing","edge detection","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A new FPGA-based edge detection system for the gridding of DNA microarray images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9718100","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new FPGA-based edge detection system for the gridding of DNA microarray images","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057617S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258186,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, the internal states are generally not directly accessible to due to high costs and physical limitations; hence they are estimated from an observer. The states observer is a mathematical model that estimates the unavailable internal states from the system input and output data. The majority of the differential equation systems encountered in control applications are ordinary differential equations (ODE). There have been previous attempts to use artificial neural networks to solve the ODE, but they were never implemented as multi-dimensional state observers in particular. Moreover, these attempts have high memory requirements and also required powerful general purposed processors to perform the required computation which can be rather costly to implement. This paper proposes solve ODE for a states observer using an artificial neural network rather than general purpose processor. The use of artificial neural networks to solve ordinary differential equations in the observer takes advantage of a set of unique constraints and opportunities that earlier proposals overlooked. This implementation appears to be a faster and cheaper method and has the potential application of solving differential models on real-time embedded system such as smart sensors and self-diagnostic systems.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379436","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258210.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Faster and Cheaper Method of Implementing States Observers using Artificial Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Observers","Differential equations","State estimation","Control theory","Costs","Mathematical model","Control systems","High performance computing","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","neural nets","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state observers","artificial neural networks","modern control theory","functional block","mathematical model","differential equation systems","ordinary differential equations","multi-dimensional state observers","smart sensors","self-diagnostic systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","differential equation","observer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Faster and Cheaper Method of Implementing States Observers using Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9718038","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Faster and Cheaper Method of Implementing States Observers using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109829S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4258236,"authors":[{"name":"Felice Crupi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Felice","lastName":"Crupi","id":"37273527500"},{"name":"Gino Giusi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Gino","lastName":"Giusi","id":"37273874300"},{"name":"Calogero Pace","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Calogero","lastName":"Pace","id":"37273530000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258236","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device noise","Power amplifiers","Noise generators","Impedance measurement","Circuit noise","CMOS technology","Instruments","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric noise measurement","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage noise measurements","two-channel amplifier","high-sensitivity","noise elimination","SPICE simulations","prototype circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier noise","noise measurement","cross-correlation","spectral analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258236","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258236.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-channel amplifier for high-sensitivity voltage noise measurements","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new method for the measurement of a voltage noise source that allows, at least in principle, the complete elimination of the noise introduced by the amplifiers used for the measurements.

Moreover, we show a significantly more efficient solution of spectral observation for a special case of uneven sampling, namely when the sampling time instants are uneven but periodic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4258316/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9718075","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Observers for Unevenly Sampled Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Observers for Unevenly Sampled Data","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034143S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258317,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran George","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"George","id":"37273322700"},{"name":"Chien-In Henry Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chien-In Henry","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280751800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258317","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":783},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Kernel","Table lookup","Discrete Fourier transforms","Dynamic range","Fast Fourier transforms","Processor scheduling","Signal resolution","Frequency response","Instrumentation and measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","microprocessor chips","microwave receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT processor","wideband communication","fast Fourier transform","lookup table","uniform bit truncation","optimum bit truncation","wideband digital receiver","digital wideband receiver","instantaneous dynamic range","digital microwave receiver","monobit receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","Kernel function FFT","look-up table (LUT)","wideband communication","two-signal instantaneous dynamic range (IDR)","digital microwave receiver","digital receiver","digital wideband receiver","Monobit receiver","Receiver-on-a-Chip (ROC)"]}],"abstract":"A practical fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor can contain several millions of gates, so effective design techniques usually are required in order to guarantee high-speed products.

The FFT processors are designed using a standard 130 nanometer CMOS process and operates down to 120 mV.

The required time for configurable LUT 12-b 1024-point FFT processing is 61 ns.

The aim is to achieve real-time recognition of different kinds of surfaces using a phase-shift rangefinder and a neural network, at a remote distance between the rangefinder and the target varying from 0.5m up to 2m and with a laser beam incidence angle with regards to the target varying between -\u03c0/5 and \u03c0/5. The NN architecture is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with two inputs, three processing neurons in the hidden layer and one output neuron. Both inputs receive analog signals directly issued from the rangefinder. The output neuron gives a voltage that indicates which surface has been detected. The ANN design presented in this paper is completely analog in order to avoid signal pre-processing before the network and to limit power consumption. The 3.3V voltage supply, relative to AMS CMOS 0.35\u03bcm chosen technology, allows also a low system power consumption but important optimization of each circuit design is required. Each cell transfer is achieved with differential currents. Sigmoid function bias current is set outside the chip in order to control the tangent hyperbolic cell linearity range. NN global consumption is equal to 15mA, with 4.4mA per neuron. The neuron size is about 276\u03bcmx148\u03bcm.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379089","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258351.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Neural Network Design for Real-Time Surface Detection with a Laser Rangefinder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Optical design","Surface emitting lasers","Neurons","Voltage","Energy consumption","Target recognition","Laser beams","Multilayer perceptrons","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser ranging","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog neural network design","real-time surface detection","laser rangefinder","optoelectronic measurement system","phase-shift rangefinder","multi-layer perceptron","signal pre-processing","CMOS","circuit design","tangent hyperbolic cell linearity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog neural network","multi-layer perceptron","analog multiplier","analog processing","surface detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analog Neural Network Design for Real-Time Surface Detection with a Laser Rangefinder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258351/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9717938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Neural Network Design for Real-Time Surface Detection with a Laser Rangefinder","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064017S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4258354,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Russo","affiliation":["D.E.E.I, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Russo","id":"37273910400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0588-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4258354","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian noise","Digital images","Genetic algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Piecewise linear techniques","Training data","Computer simulation","Nonlinear filters","Noise reduction","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","Gaussian noise","image processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise estimation","digital images","nonlinear sharpening","genetic optimization","nonlinear amplification","multiparameter piecewise linear"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise estimation","nonlinear filters","genetic algorithms","image processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379092","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258354.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Noise Estimation in Digital Images Using Nonlinear Sharpening and Genetic Optimization","abstract":"A new approach to estimation of Gaussian noise in digital images is presented.

With such growing demand, manufacturers are constantly striving to build more densely packed FPGAs with higher logic capacity thus increasing the probability of errors. The proposed architecture is capable of correcting faults in the FPGA cells within the same clock cycle. This architecture consists of an array of identical FPGA cells each of which may be used for logic functionality, for interconnect, or for both, thus avoiding any intricate network of interconnects, switching boxes, or routers commonly found in commercially available FPGAs. An FPGA cell can have different modes of operation and, collectively a group of such cells can implement any logic function that is either registered or combinational. The built-in fault tolerance is capable of correcting, on average, one error per cell where the errors can result from either permanent faults (such as stuck-at faults) or transient faults (errors resulting from radiation or other transient effects). Thus, an on-line fault tolerant FPGA architecture has been proposed that is more suited for tolerating transient faults within every FPGA cell in the same clock cycle. This is unlike any of the currently available commercial FPGA devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel FPGA Architecture with Built-in Error Correction","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379193","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258367.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel FPGA Architecture with Built-in Error Correction","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258367/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9717943","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel FPGA Architecture with Built-in Error Correction","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054869S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4258374,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

Low power is realized mainly by using a first-order architecture and minimizing the capacitors. For the modulator, a boosted-folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is optimized to achieve a gain of 90dB with a unity-gain bandwidth of 300MHz. The decimator is also optimized by placing part of the circuit at the chip level. Zero distortion is possible in the decimator due to the discrete-time nature of the input signal. The proposed ADC allows a reduction in the read-out nonlinearity of a CMOS image sensor, enabling a high SNR to be realized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Delta-Sigma ADC for Column-Level Data Conversion in CMOS Image Sensors","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2007.379253","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Technology Conference IMTC 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258011/4258012/04258383.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2007.379253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Delta-Sigma ADC for Column-Level Data Conversion in CMOS Image Sensors","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258383/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9702819","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Delta-Sigma ADC for Column-Level Data Conversion in CMOS Image Sensors","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05347S","chronDate":"1-3 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258011","isNumber":"4258012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258011","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4258012","articleId":"4258383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258434,"authors":[{"name":"Nawaf N.

The method is based on the comparison of the DAC output voltage signal with a reference one furnished by a calibrator instrument.

The variation in the time domain of the zero crossing sequence distribution respect to that occurring in the sinusoidal reference signal is used to evaluate the DAC transfer characteristic, the INL and the DNL. The advantage of the method consists in the fact that the analog to digital converter to be used to acquire the resulting signal can be characterized by a lower resolution respect to the DAC under test.

Model estimations show excellent consistence with measured data. As well, cell-breathing phenomenon has been detected. In estimating the Downlink pole capacity of WCDMA radio network, we propose a new algorithm to calculate orthogonality factor for different spreading codes and derive a dual logarithm equation for the orthogonality factor with respect to the data bit rate.

The management algorithm reduces the amount of physical capacity required to support a specified rate of SLA violations for a given workload by as much as 50% as compared to static consolidation approach. Another result is that the rate of SLA violations at fixed capacity may be reduced by up to 20%.

We consider the problem of such automated modeling in server-type applications whose performance degrades depending on the \"work\" done since last rejuvenation, for example the number of served requests. This type of performance degradation - caused mostly by resource depletion - is common, as we illustrate in a study of the popular Axis Soap server 1.3. In particular, we propose deterministic models for approximating the leading indicators of aging and an automated procedure for statistical testing of their correctness. We further demonstrate how to use these models for finding optimal rejuvenation schedules under utility functions. Our focus is on the important case that the utility function is the average of a performance metric (such as maximum service rate). We also consider optional SLA constraints under which the performance should never drop below a specified level. Our approach is verified by a study of the aging processes in the Axis Soap 1.3 server. The experiments show that the deterministic modeling technique is appropriate in this case, and that the optimization of rejuvenation schedules can greatly improve the average maximum service rate of an aging application.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2007.374780","startPage":"159","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258513/4258514/04258532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 10th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2007.374780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic Models of Software Aging and Optimal Rejuvenation Schedules","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Application software","Degradation","Software performance","Yarn","Operating systems","Service oriented architecture","Space vehicles","Military communication","Production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program testing","scheduling","software fault tolerance","software maintenance","software metrics","software performance evaluation","statistical testing","utility programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software aging deterministic model","optimal adaptive software rejuvenation schedule","cost-effective usage","self-healing technique","server-type application","resource depletion","utility function","software performance metric","SLA constraint","software reliability","statistical software correctness testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic Models of Software Aging and Optimal Rejuvenation Schedules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10289867","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic Models of Software Aging and Optimal Rejuvenation Schedules","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"INM-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1546S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258513","isNumber":"4258514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258513","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4258514","articleId":"4258532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4258546,"authors":[{"name":"Irina Rish","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Due to infeasibility of exhaustive pairwise measurements, a natural alternative is to predict unobserved end-to-end performances from available historic data, with minimal additional measurements. In this paper we present an approach to this based on Collaborative Prediction (CP), an estimation method designed to work with sparse data, that has enjoyed much success in other domains (e.g. product recommendation systems), and obviates the need for landmark nodes commonly assumed in other approaches. Specifically, we use Max-Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF), a linear factor model for CP that has outperformed state- of-art CP techniques. Moreover, our approach readily admits active sampling based on prediction confidence, and we further propose a novel active-sampling CP approach yielding even higher predictive accuracy, while allowing a flexible trade-off between \"exploration\" (choosing suboptimal samples to improve estimation accuracy) and \"exploitation\" (choosing node with best estimated performance).

However, the standard technique of placing sensors in a perimeter is not optimal. Using optimization techniques to determine sensor placement can improve the effectiveness of the sensor network. The optimization should take into account the environmental conditions and place sensors to take advantage of these conditions. Additionally, there are multiple objectives to consider in sensor placement, specifically the probability of detection and the time to detect. Genetic algorithms are capable of optimizing both objectives simultaneously, achieving the Pareto-optimal curve. This allows the designer of the network to specify a necessary value for one objective and get sensor placements that optimize the other objective.

Using our techniques, unusual regions of a graph can be selected for deeper analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ISI.2007.379473","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Intelligence and Security Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Intelligence and Security Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258655/4258656/04258699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISI.2007.379473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258656","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomalies in Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomalies in Graphs","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258699/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9703608","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4258699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Anomalies in Graphs","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"ISI-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041569S","chronDate":"23-24 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258655","isNumber":"4258656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258655","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4258656","articleId":"4258699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4258770,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Palmese","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Palmese","id":"37300998800"},{"name":"Andrea Trucco","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Trucco","id":"37300998200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0964-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0965-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-2809"}],"articleNumber":"4258770","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":314},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4258770","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Underwater acoustics","Image generation","Layout","Signal generators","Planar arrays","Image sensors","Acoustic sensors","Sensor arrays","Acoustic beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","computational complexity","transforms","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain digital near field beamforming algorithm","real-time 3D underwater acoustic image generation","planar sensor array","chirp Zeta transform","linear array","wideband signal processing","Fresnel approximation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sonar systems","3-D acoustic imaging","planar arrays","frequency-domain near field beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IST.2007.379570","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/4258758/4258759/04258770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2007.379570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4258759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Near Field Beamforming for Efficient 3-D Underwater Acoustic Image Generation","abstract":"To generate volumetric underwater acoustic images a planar array of sensors is required to collect the signals coming from a 3-D scene. The method most frequently used to perform the spatial elaboration of the acquired signals is the beamforming algorithm. In general, owing to the huge number of sensors and the massive number of beam signals, computational load becomes prohibitive for real-time image generation. An efficient frequency beamforming implementation based on the use of the Chirp Zeta Transform (CZT) has been proposed in the literature for the case of a scene placed in the far-field and involving linear arrays. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to perform CZT beamforming on the wideband signals collected by a planar array and generated by a scene placed in the near-field. This extension becomes simpler and feasible thanks to (i) a non-conventional method of defining the azimuth and elevation angles; (ii) the Fresnel approximation in the delay computation; (iii) an adequate organization of the different operations. In terms of computational complexity, the analysis compares the solution developed with traditional beamforming techniques, showing several advantages of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4258770/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9702299","publicationDate":"May 2007","conferenceDate":"5-5 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4258770/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital Near Field Beamforming for Efficient 3-D Underwater Acoustic Image Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Near Field Beamforming for Efficient 3-D Underwater Acoustic Image Generation","confLoc":"Cracovia, Poland","sourcePdf":"IST-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059028S","chronDate":"5-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4258758","isNumber":"4258759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4258758","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4258759","articleId":"4258770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4258784,"authors":[{"name":"Pawel Turcza","affiliation":["Department of Instrumentation and Measurement, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland","Center of Innovation, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Turcza","id":"37268980800"},{"name":"Mariusz Duplaga","affiliation":["Center of Innovation, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Duplaga","id":"37295609400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0964-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0965-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-2809"}],"articleNumber":"4258784","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Endoscopes","Discrete cosine transforms","Wireless sensor networks","CMOS image sensors","Chromium","Entropy","Energy consumption","Data processing","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","endoscopes","image coding","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power image compression","wireless capsule endoscopy","communication bandwidth","power limitation","discrete cosine transform","DCT","entropy Huffman coder","high-quality lossy compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video capsule","Endoscopy","Image compression"]}],"abstract":"In the paper image compression algorithm suitable for wireless capsule endoscopy is proposed.

The estimated peaks in the pre- and post-compression signals are assigned to each other by a peak matching technique with the goal of minimizing the number of false matches. The method allows local shifts of the tissue to be estimated. The method has been tested in one-dimensional simulations and phantom experiments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the rms error are shown to be better than for the standard cross-correlation method (CC). The new estimator remains unbiased for up to 10% strain which is a larger range than that of CC. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is 3 times as high as that of the CC method, showing higher sensitivity as well. The method is computationally efficient, achieving 0.7 msec/RF line on a standard personal computer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency

At Intel, DFM techniques are utilized to combat variability at all stages of product delivery-design, tape-out, mask generation, fab processing and assembly. Statistical process control (SPC), advanced process control (APC) and fault detection and classification (FDC) are examples of key capabilities used in the fab for variability detection, containment and correction on processing equipment and manufacturing process. This paper will focus on adaptive metrology sampling (AMS) and its role in variability detection and control during fab processing. AMS includes lot, wafer and field level metrology sampling strategies that varies the amount of sampling based on previous observations which include fab events and/or process control feedback. Adaptive sampling if implemented appropriately will improve precision in excursion detection, reduce detection time, minimize the quantity of silicon at risk and yield losses from such excursions. This paper will illustrate key strategies and techniques that should be considered for a successful AMS implementation. This includes details on system architecture, data inputs, sample material selection rules, and metrology capacity management strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.2007.375072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.2007.375072","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259214/4259215/04259238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Metrology Sampling techniques enabling higher precision in variability detection and control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Metrology Sampling techniques enabling higher precision in variability detection and control","conferenceDate":"11-12 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259238/","accessionNumber":"9881763","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259238/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Metrology Sampling techniques enabling higher precision in variability detection and control","confLoc":"Stresa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ASMC-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04465S","chronDate":"11-12 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259214","isNumber":"4259215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259214","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4259215","articleId":"4259238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4259287,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Drozda-Freeman","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Drozda-Freeman","id":"38273185400"},{"name":"Mike McIntyre","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"McIntyre","id":"37357584800"},{"name":"Mike Retersdorf","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Retersdorf","id":"37698561000"},{"name":"Christopher Wooten","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Wooten","id":"38273444400"},{"name":"Xin Song","affiliation":["Rudolph Technologies, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Song","id":"38278106800"},{"name":"Adam Hesse","affiliation":["Rudolph Technologies, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Hesse","id":"38273731300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0652-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0653-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1078-8743"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6697"}],"articleNumber":"4259287","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Manufacturing automation","Semiconductor device manufacture","Libraries","Pattern classification","Engines","Humans","Production facilities","Shape","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","semiconductor device manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated spatial pattern recognition","semiconductor manufacturing","wafers","Rudolph Technologies","AMD manufacturing","test facilities","problem identification"]}],"abstract":"Modern semiconductor manufacturing facilities process thousands of wafers a week and produce enormous volumes of data that must be quickly and efficiently mined for yield signals.

The motivation of this proposal is to address the disadvantages of OFDM system, i.e., the high peak to average power ratio and sensitivity to carrier frequency offset at the same time. Although more robust performance and higher bandwidth efficiency are achieved, the implementation of the MSE-OFDM receiver is substantially more complicated than OFDM. In this paper, we propose a new cyclic prefix using pseudo random sequence for MSE-OFDM. With the new introduced cyclic prefix, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) within one MSE-OFDM frame can be easily canceled in time domain. It is shown that the implementation complexity of the MSE-OFDM receiver with the new cyclic prefix is comparable to the traditional OFDM.

A limitation of OFDM systems is the high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmitted signal, which reduces the efficiency of the power amplifier. This paper investigates the selected mapping method (SLM) for PAR reduction of BI-COFDM-ID. It is shown that, while maintaining the error performance, applying SLM substantially reduces the PAR with a minimal increase in receiver complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On PAR Reduction of Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM with Iterative Decoding","publicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2007.375694","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259730/4259731/04259748.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2007.375694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259748","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On PAR Reduction of Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM with Iterative Decoding","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259748/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9815664","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On PAR Reduction of Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM with Iterative Decoding","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045029S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259730","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","xplore-issue":"4259731","articleId":"4259748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4259756,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"},{"name":"Amir H.

DSC allows a low-complexity encoder, shifting the high complexity to the decoder, making this scheme appropriate for sensor networks. In this paper, we have extended the non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, developed for channel coding, to be used for distributed source coding of correlated non-binary sources. The system consists of an equiprobable memoryless non-binary source with side information at the decoder. The correlation between the sources is modelled as a virtual channel. The results obtained through simulations demonstrate that for rates 1/2 and 3/4, the non-binary compression scheme performs better the equivalent binary compression scheme. This scheme makes it extremely suitable for sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4259766/","accessionNumber":"9815668","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Source Coding using non-binary LDPC codes for sensor network applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Source Coding using non-binary LDPC codes for sensor network applications","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033716S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259730","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4259731","articleId":"4259766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4259767,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali","affiliation":["Coding & Signal Transmission Laboratory, Department of Elec. and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali","lastName":"Maddah-Ali","id":"38556924000"},{"name":"Abolfazl S.

In this scenario, it is assumed that each transmitter is unaware of the other transmitter's data (non-cooperative scenario). This system can be considered as a combination of two broadcast channels (from the transmitters' point of view) and two multi-access channels (from the receivers' point of view). Taking advantage of both perspectives, two signaling schemes for such a scenario are developed. In these schemes, some linear filters are employed at the transmitters and at the receivers which decompose the system into either two non-interfering multi-antenna broadcast sub-channels or two non-interfering multi-antenna multi-access sub-channels. In addition, these filters are designed such that the maximum multiplexing gain (MG) of the system is attained by exploiting the null spaces of the direct and cross channels. It is shown that the proposed scenario outperforms other known non-cooperative schemes in terms of the achievable MG. In particular, it is shown that for some specific cases, the achieved MG is the same as the MG of the system if the full cooperation is provided either between the transmitters or between the receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition of the MIMO X Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2007.375713","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259730/4259731/04259767.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2007.375713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259767","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Decomposition of the MIMO X Channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259767/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9815669","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition of the MIMO X Channels","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086852S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259730","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4259731","articleId":"4259767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4259768,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy H.

We begin by providing insight into the way in which these constellations are structured, and we then provide two new techniques for designing them. The first technique enables joint design of all the constellation points by exploiting a new method (proposed herein) for simultaneous optimization of multiple points on the Grassmann manifold. This in contrast to most existing techniques in which the points are designed sequentially. The second technique is a more efficient method for designing large constellations. By expressing large constellations as the disjoint union of rotated versions of a 'proto-constellation', one can partition the design problem into the design of a (small) proto-constellation and that of the rotation matrices. It will be shown that, in addition to providing storage and regeneration convenience, the rotation-based design retains two desirable features of the optimal design. Finally, we will provide numerical simulations that illustrate the performance of the constellations designed with the proposed techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259730/4259731/04259768.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2007.375714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2007.375714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of Grassmannian constellations for non-coherent MIMO communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Design optimization","Design methodology","Numerical simulation","Transmitters","Channel state information","Block codes","Constraint optimization","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO communication","optimisation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Grassmannian constellation design","noncoherent MIMO communication system","wireless communication","optimization","rotation matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the design of Grassmannian constellations for non-coherent MIMO communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259768/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9815670","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of Grassmannian constellations for non-coherent MIMO communication systems","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053785S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259730","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4259731","articleId":"4259768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4259769,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Botros Shenouda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael Botros","lastName":"Shenouda","id":"37542484100"},{"name":"Timothy N.

Based on its channel knowledge, the receiver will select a suitable precoder from a codebook and will feed back the index of this precoder to the transmitter using a limited number of feedback bits. We begin by developing a unified framework for the joint design of the precoder and DFE receiver that embraces a wide range of design criteria. We then characterize the statistical distribution of the optimal precoder in a standard Rayleigh fading environment. Using this distribution, we show that codebooks constructed from Grassmann packings will minimize an upper bound on an average distortion measure. Our simulation study shows that using only a limited number of of feedback bits, the proposed scheme can achieve that same rate of decay of bit error rate with signal to noise ration (SNR) as that achieved with perfect CSI at the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2007.375715","publicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259730/4259731/04259769.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2007.375715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback Design of MIMO Systems with Zero-forcing DFE Using Grassmann Codebooks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259769","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259769/","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback Design of MIMO Systems with Zero-forcing DFE Using Grassmann Codebooks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9815671","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259769/","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback Design of MIMO Systems with Zero-forcing DFE Using Grassmann Codebooks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140835S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4259769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4259773,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Mobasher","affiliation":["Coding & Signal Transmission Laboratory, Department of Elec. and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Mobasher","id":"37418536800"},{"name":"Amir K.

We compute BCH-like bounds on the free distances which can be controlled as in the case of block codes, and establish that the codes have non-catastrophic encoders.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2007.375730","publicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 10th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259730/4259731/04259784.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2007.375730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Convolutional BCH Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259784","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Convolutional BCH Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259784/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9815685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4259784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Convolutional BCH Codes","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"CWIT-00-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050133S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4259730","isNumber":"4259731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259730","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4259731","articleId":"4259784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4259787,"authors":[{"name":"Yufang Hao","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yufang","lastName":"Hao","id":"37667623300"},{"name":"Achim Kempf","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Achim","lastName":"Kempf","id":"37671436200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0768-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0769-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4259787","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Lattices","Signal sampling","Mathematics","Disruption tolerant networking","Heart","Information theory","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonFourier generalization","Shannon sampling theory","Nyquist rate","realistic signal","communication engineering","signal processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259787","abstract":"Shannon sampling theory, which is in ubiquitous use in communication engineering and signal processing, shows that in order to record all information contained in a \u03a9-bandlimited continuous signal it \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">suffices</i>\n to record samples of the signal's amplitude at discrete points in time, namely at the so-called Nyquist rate of 2\u03a9 samples per second.

First, kinematics and dynamics of the mechanical subsystem and the relation between different forces acting on the object using different Jacobians are derived. It is shown that the dynamic model of two robots has the same properties that the dynamic model of a single robot has; this permits to use the control schemes, which are used for control of a robot, to control two cooperating robots. Then the actuator dynamics of each robot is included into dynamic equation of two robots and a third order matrix equation is obtained. At the end, a neural network controller scheme is developed for this third order dynamics and the related Lyapunov function is established. This controller guarantees asymptotic tracking of the object desired trajectory.","doi":"10.1109/WAC.2006.375991","pdfPath":"/iel5/4259800/4259805/04259907.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 World Automation Congress","publicationTitle":"2006 World Automation Congress","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAC.2006.375991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4259805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Control of two Electrically Driven Cooperating 6 DOF Robot Manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4259907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Control of two Electrically Driven Cooperating 6 DOF Robot Manipulators","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9718981","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4259907/","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Control of two Electrically Driven Cooperating 6 DOF Robot Manipulators","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"WAC-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083546S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4259800","isNumber":"4259805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4259800","xplore-issue":"4259805","articleId":"4259907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Press","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4259934,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Lung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Lung","lastName":"Huang","id":"37697408400"},{"name":"Chi-Hsiung Tung","affiliation":["National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hsiung","lastName":"Tung","id":"37693888600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-889335-33-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-4824"}],"articleNumber":"4259934","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic mutations","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Single machine scheduling","Evolutionary computation","Heuristic algorithms","Ant colony optimization","Automation","Information management","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","single machine scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete particle swarm optimization","single machine total weighted tardiness problem","dynamic mutation operator","evolutionary algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Mutation","Genetic algorithm","Scheduling","Total weighted tardiness","Permutation problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4259934","abstract":"This study uses a random transposition for a dynamic mutation operator similar to those used in evolutionary algorithms to optimize the problem of the total weighted tardiness for single machine.

The existing results about the convergence rate for genetic algorithms can be classified into two types. One type is based on Doeblin condition in which some parameters should be estimated. The other type needs to estimate the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix. However, these parameters are difficult to estimate.
