We present a scalable scheduling algorithm which can schedule the tasks of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with a complexity of O(V/sup 2/) in the worst case, where V is the number of nodes of the DAG. This algorithm generates an optimal schedule for a class of DAGs which satisfy certain conditions and if the required number of processors are available. The algorithm initially generates a schedule for a small number of processors. In case the available number of processors are higher than the number of processors required by the initial schedule, the algorithm scales the schedule appropriately in an effort to obtain a lower parallel time by utilizing the extra or idle processors. The algorithm has been applied to some practical DAGs and the results are very promising.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of SPDP '96: 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1996.570320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1996.570320","pdfPath":"/iel3/4218/12269/00570320.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of SPDP '96: 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable scheduling algorithm for distributed memory machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1996","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Scalable scheduling algorithm for distributed memory machines","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465316","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable scheduling algorithm for distributed memory machines","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00570320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036187S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4218","citationCount":"6","articleId":"570320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":570324,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An important issue in the analysis and evaluation of multithreaded execution is the design and performance of the storage hierarchy. Because of the sequential execution of threads, the locality of access within an executing thread can be exploited using registers and cache. At the inter-thread level, however, the locality of accesses to memory and its effect on the cache is not yet well understood.

Our results include improved algorithms for minimum spanning trees, breadth-first search, and single-source shortest paths.

It is targeted to situations where the size of message data is very small, like in invalidation and update messages in distributed shared-memory multiprocessors (DSMs) with hardware cache coherence. The mechanism is a variation of tree-based multicast with pruning to avoid deadlocks. The new scheme does not require that the destination addresses in a given multicast message be ordered, thereby avoiding any ordering overhead. It allows messages to use any deadlock-free routing function and only requires one startup for each multicast message. The new scheme has been evaluated on several k-ary n-cube networks under synthetic loads. The results show that the proposed scheme is faster than other multicast mechanisms when the multicast traffic is composed of short messages.","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1996.570332","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of SPDP '96: 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of SPDP '96: 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4218/12269/00570332.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1996.570332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient implementation of tree-based multicast routing for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=570332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570332/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient implementation of tree-based multicast routing for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5465328","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient implementation of tree-based multicast routing for distributed shared-memory multiprocessors","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00570332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019379S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4218","citationCount":"42","articleId":"570332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":570369,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The authors propose a new combined approach, where a genetic algorithm is improved with the introduction of some knowledge about the scheduling problem represented by the use of a list heuristic in the crossover and mutation genetic operations. This knowledge-augmented genetic approach is empirically compared with a \"pure\" genetic algorithm and with a \"pure\" list heuristic, both from the literature.

Shape modeling is a very important issue for shape recognition for robot vision, representing 3-D shapes in the virtual world, and so on. Superquadrics are often used for shape modeling because they can represent various shapes by using a single equation. The proposed method estimates the superquadric parameters of every object from shading images which are taken with a CCD camera. The parameter estimation is performed by GAs because the GAs can efficiently find the optimized solution. The superquadric parameters are represented by strings. The string is evaluated by the similarity between the given 2-D shading image and the calculated shading image from the 3-D shape represented by the parameters. In the proposed method, the sharing scheme is used for finding multiple solutions efficiently. Some results of the computer experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide good model descriptions from shading images.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.570631","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1593 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.570631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12261","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4195/12261/00570631.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superquadric modeling of multiple objects from shading images using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570631/","displayDocTitle":"Superquadric modeling of multiple objects from shading images using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5545481","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superquadric modeling of multiple objects from shading images using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00570631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034019S","chronDate":"5-10 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4195","citationCount":"2","articleId":"570631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":570643,"authors":[{"name":"Kar-Han Tan","affiliation":["Commotion Laboratory Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kar-Han Tan","id":"37087874753"},{"name":"M.A. Lewis","affiliation":["Commotion Laboratory Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37275839500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3213-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"570643","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=570643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual structures for high-precision cooperative mobile robotic control","abstract":"A key problem in cooperative robotics is the maintenance of a geometric configuration during movement. To address this problem, the concept of a virtual structure is introduced. Control methods are developed to force an ensemble of robots to behave as if they were particles embedded in a rigid structure. The method was tested both using simulation and experimentation with a set of three robots. Results are presented which demonstrate that this approach is capable of achieving high precision movement which is fault tolerant and exhibits graceful degradation of performance. In addition, this algorithm does not require leader selection as in other cooperative robotic strategies. Finally, the method is highly flexible in the kinds of geometric formations that can be maintained.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1996.570643","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Especially, passive optical networks prove to be a cost-effective way to introduce fiber into the access network.

Several algorithms have been proposed but only two return the k-best assignments in reasonable time. One is Danchick and Newnams' [1993] algorithm, which is based on the recognition that determining the best assignment is a classical assignment problem and that determining a ranked set of assignments may be accomplished by solving a series of modified copies of the initial assignment problem. The other algorithm is originally due to Murty [1968] and was most recently described within the context of multitarget tracking. We evaluate the two algorithm using randomly generated data and data obtained from an electrooptical sensor simulation in which 90 missiles are launched. These evaluations show that Murty's algorithm perform significantly better in all scenarios. We show the relationship between the two algorithms and how Danchick and Newnam's algorithm can be very easily modified to Murty's algorithm. Experimental results using Murty's algorithm suggest that a solution to the real-time data association problem is now feasible.","doi":"10.1109/7.570789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/12318/00570789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.570789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12318","startPage":"295","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of two algorithms for determining ranked assignments with application to multitarget tracking and motion correspondence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=570789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of two algorithms for determining ranked assignments with application to multitarget tracking and motion correspondence","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5504000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of two algorithms for determining ranked assignments with application to multitarget tracking and motion correspondence","sourcePdf":"00570789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031377S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"32","articleId":"570789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":570818,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

Bayesian bootstrap filtering is a very powerful technique since it is not restricted by model assumptions of linearity and/or Gaussian noise. The standard implementation of the bootstrap filter, however, is not time efficient for large sample sizes, which often precludes its utilization. We propose an approach that dramatically decreases the computation time of the standard bootstrap filter and at the same time preserves its excellent performance. The time decrease is realized by resampling the prior into the posterior distribution at time instant k by using sampling blocks of varying size, rather than a sample at a time as in the standard approach. The size of each block resampled into the posterior in the algorithm proposed here depends on the product of the normalized weight determined by the likelihood function for each prior sample and the sample size N under consideration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","volume":"33","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5504010","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A fast-weighted Bayesian bootstrap filter for nonlinear model state estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast-weighted Bayesian bootstrap filter for nonlinear model state estimation","sourcePdf":"00570818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041652S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"52","articleId":"570818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":570821,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

The method which uses a time average over a suitably chosen window in order to generate the required gradients, has been used in [2] for the design of an adaptive beamformer. The algorithm essentially uses time diversity to obtain improved performance. We consider a modification which essentially combines spatial and time diversity to obtain an algorithm for adaptive beamforming which has potential application in cellular communication systems.

Traceable e-cash would make it harder to commit many crimes but would also threaten users' privacy. Completely untraceable digital cash would pose new difficulties for law enforcement agencies. Although physical cash has certain properties of an anonymous medium, its anonymous use is significantly constrained by the following considerations: bulk-large amounts of money take up a certain amount of space, but this sort of bulk sometimes helps authorities track money; transactional delays-the process of transferring, verifying, and counting bills takes at least a few seconds and for larger quantities, the times required are even less trivial; palpability-physical cash cannot be transferred over a computer network, and transferring it securely to a remote payee takes time and resources that may render the process somewhat visible; traceability-if law enforcement authorities know the serial numbers of bills being tracked, financial institutions may be able to help identify the next person who deposits them.","doi":"10.1109/6.570827","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","startPage":"35","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel3/6/12295/00570827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.570827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traceable e-cash","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Law enforcement","Counterfeiting","Printing","Delay","Computer networks","Cameras","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial data processing","data privacy","computer crime","government policies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traceable e-cash","electronic cash systems","anonymity","traceability","crimes","user privacy","untraceable digital cash","law enforcement agencies","physical cash","transactional delays","remote payee","serial numbers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Traceable e-cash","volume":"34","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5504018","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/570827/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traceable e-cash","sourcePdf":"0297-035Traceable.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039627S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"2","articleId":"570827","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":570915,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Shin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Shin Lai","id":"37087065521"},{"name":"S.R.

Direct time-of-flight laser rangefinders present themselves as an attractive alternative to other vision systems commonly employed in robotic vision systems, such as triangulation and ultrasound rangefinders, thanks to their superior radial and lateral accuracy. However, laser rangefinders present safety problems, due to the power level of the emitted beam, which condition their use in human environments. In the present work, the authors deal with the problem of safety, reducing the emitted power by employing different means to enhance receiver sensitivity. A first result of this work is presented in this paper, describing the development and preliminary experimental results of a direct detection laser rangefinder, which covers a maximum range of 7 metres with an emitted optical power of only 2 milliwatts.

Generally designed for static environments, roadmaps are often invalidated by any anomaly between the real world and the model of the environment. We investigate the effect on roadmaps when sensor information indicates such an error and describe an algorithm which, by performing further pre-processing on the known environment, generates a mapping between points in the workspace and the road map. Used during on-line planning the mapping enables a valid, although not necessarily connected, roadmap to be maintained if such an error is discovered. We then present a divide and conquer algorithm which uses guided random motion to attempt to reconnect paths affected by the error. This is the first step towards a global planner that could be used in evolving environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The system has separate a conditioned stimulus (CS) input channel and unconditioned stimulus (US) input channel, which is analogous to classical conditioning. During learning, pairs of sequences of spatial patterns are presented to the CS and the US input channels simultaneously and the system learns to associate patterns at successive times in sequence. During retrieval, an imperfect cue sequence, which may be obscured by spatial noise and temporal gaps, causes the system to output the stored spatio-temporal sequence.

The degradation of the reconstructed image quality is less than 0.38 dB in PSNR while the bit rate is reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIGP.1996.571162","startPage":"1504","endPage":"1507 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP'96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4274/12308/00571162.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP'96)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIGP.1996.571162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selectively tree-structured vector quantizer using Kohonen neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computational complexity","PSNR","Tree data structures","Bit rate","Degradation","Computer networks","Image reconstruction","Image quality","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","computational complexity","self-organising feature maps","tree data structures","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kohonen neural network","computational complexity","image fidelity","vector quantization","VQ","real-time applications","three-phase self-organizing feature map","TPSOFM algorithm","three-level tree-structured codebooks","tree-structured vector quantizer","training time","reconstructed image quality","PSNR","bit rate reduction","image coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Selectively tree-structured vector quantizer using Kohonen neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5651762","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selectively tree-structured vector quantizer using Kohonen neural network","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"00571162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029954S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274","articleId":"571162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":571223,"authors":[{"name":"Fuchun Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, National Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fuchun Sun","id":"37087184919"},{"name":"Zengqi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, National Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zengqi Sun","id":"37087143665"},{"name":"Rongjun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, National Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Rongjun Zhang","id":"37087196183"},{"name":"Fuming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, National Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fuming Zhang","id":"37087195166"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3280-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"571223","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Robot control","Neural networks","Control systems","Trajectory","Sun","Nonlinear control systems","Manipulators","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot dynamics","adaptive control","neurocontrollers","large-scale systems","singularly perturbed systems","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate adaptive composite controller","flexible-link robots","neural networks","trajectory tracking control","partially known nonlinear dynamics","singular perturbation method","two time-scale decomposition","slow subsystem","fast subsystem","neural network-based adaptive controller","rigid-link manipulator","equilibrium trajectory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571223","abstract":"A multirate adaptive composite controller using neural networks is presented in this paper for the trajectory tracking control of a flexible-link robot with a partially known nonlinear dynamics.

Thus, separate slow and fast control laws can be designed for each subsystem and then combined into a composite control.

Each CMAC in the new structure has a subset of system inputs as its inputs. Several CMACs that have different subsets of inputs form a submodule and many submodules form a neural network. The output of a submodule is the product of its CMACs' outputs. Each submodule implements a self-generated basis function, which is developed during the learning. The outputs from submodules are added up to be the neural network output. Using only a subset of inputs in each CMAC significantly reduces the needed memory space and overcomes the enormous memory size problem in the conventional CMAC in high-dimensional modeling. With the same size of memory, the new structure is able to achieve much smaller learning error compared to the conventional CMAC.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1996.571298","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1302 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

The key result is that the most area-efficient global routing architecture is one with uniform (or very nearly uniform) channel capacities across the entire chip in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

Given combinatorial problems which are subject to precedence and resource constraints, it is important to develop an efficient representational scheme and effective genetic operators of the GAs for better performance. The GA features a number of advantages. They are robust in the sense that they provide good solution on a wide range of the problem, in addition they can easily be modified with respect to the objective function and constraints. For better performance, we use conjointly the assignment and scheduling problems in order to create new representational scheme (parallel form) for a crossover and mutation operators. These operators can exchange meaningful ordering information of parents effectively without producing illegal solutions.

VRA is analyzed with adaptive beamforming design techniques over a set of likely interference scenarios. The design criterion is determined by a compromise between complexity and performance levels, taking into account both the array geometry and adaptive beamforming methods. Eigenstructure analysis of the data covariance matrix is provided too. Extensive numerical simulations with several sets of interference scenarios show that VRA almost always is a very convenient choice with respect to uniform regular array (URA).

In this paper, we consider modeling of S-dimensional distributed signal sources, in which a distributed source is represented by the center angles and degrees of dispersion. We address estimation of the elevation and azimuth angles of distributed sources based on the proposed distributed source modeling in the 3-dimensional space. Some examples are also included to more explicitly show the estimation procedures under the model: computer simulation results obtained by MUSIC-based methods with two uniform linear arrays are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Direction of arrival estimation","Multiple signal classification","Gas insulated transmission lines","Computer simulation","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear arrays","direction of arrival estimation","DOA estimation","signal source localization","distributed source models","S-dimensional distributed signal sources","center angles","degrees of dispersion","elevation angle estimation","azimuth angle estimation","three-dimensional space","MUSIC-based methods","uniform linear arrays","multiple signal classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571406","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12350/00571406.pdf","startPage":"868","endPage":"872 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of distributed elevation and azimuth angles using linear arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of distributed elevation and azimuth angles using linear arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571406/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5609035","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of distributed elevation and azimuth angles using linear arrays","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036598S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","articleId":"571406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":571407,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is noted that the MMSE receiver will often lose the phase lock on the desired signal when that signal dips into a deep fade. A modification to the MMSE receiver is presented which is demonstrated to function quite nicely in flat fading channels. Analytical results for the modified MMSE receiver are presented and found to agree very well with simulation results. These analytical results are then compared to the theoretical performance of the conventional (i.e., correlator) receiver in terms of both the BER and capacity. As expected, the modified MMSE receiver is found to offer a substantial improvement in both the BER and capacity. Finally, a simple, empirically derived formula is given which provides a good approximation to the BER of the modified MMSE receiver in a Rayleigh fading environment. This formula can also be used to determine the number of users a system can support. It is noted, that as the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ grows, it is quite feasible to approach 100% channel utilization with the MMSE receiver whereas a conventional receiver is typically limited to a utilization of 10-20%.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571412","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12350/00571412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12350","startPage":"898","endPage":"902 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified MMSE receiver for detection of DS-CDMA signals in fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modified MMSE receiver for detection of DS-CDMA signals in fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571412/","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5609041","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified MMSE receiver for detection of DS-CDMA signals in fading channels","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045847S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"16","articleId":"571412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":571413,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

It is proved that the probability that the single channel complexity is greater than A/sup /spl tau// approaches zero exponentially fast as the average number /spl tau/ of simultaneous users in each channel increases, where A is the modulation alphabet size. The moments of the detection complexity function of each channel is found. The ratio of the /spl kappa/-th root of the /spl kappa/-th order moment of the complexity function to the complexity of applying the VOMD directly to a single channel CDMA system with the same number of users approaches zero for all /spl kappa//spl ges/1 as the number of channels increases. The probability distribution of the joint complexity function (JCF) of the aggregate system is also found. It is shown that with a probability close to 1.0 the JCF concentrates in a small region centered at the mean of the JCF, whose order of magnitude is much less than that of applying the VOMD directly to a single channel CDMA system with the same number of simultaneous users.

It has been found that use of the IMSPRT with continuous integration results in negligible noncoherent implementation loss (compared to coherent acquisition) when a moderate number of correlators are used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent hybrid acquisition of DS/CDMA signals","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571430","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '96 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4198/12350/00571430.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"992 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1996.571430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent hybrid acquisition of DS/CDMA signals","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5609059","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent hybrid acquisition of DS/CDMA signals","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028631S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"3","articleId":"571430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":571434,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

The technique uses maximum likelihood principles on the baseband quadrature samples, and has the flexibility to incorporate an arbitrary number of PSK types. The classification performance is examined theoretically and is found to provide better performance than any of the other techniques known in the literature. This is compared in a graphical form with the qLLR and optimum phase methods. The improvement over the qLLR technique is seen to be marginal, but the sensitivity of the new technique due to parametric degradation is seen to be better in the cases examined. In order to improve the computational efficiency, simplifying approximations for the likelihood functions are implemented through the use of Pade approximations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571434/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5609063","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood PSK classifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood PSK classifier","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046724S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4198","citationCount":"13","articleId":"571434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":571462,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Examples of such systems include wavelength division-multiplexed (WDM) fiber optic communication systems which utilize the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as a source of broadband light. The wideband ASE noise from the EDFA is \"spectrum-sliced\" to create multiple light sources which provide a low-cost alternative to multiple coherent lasers for such applications. Each slice of the spectrum is actually a burst of noise which may be modulated individually for a high capacity WDM system. The detection sensitivity of binary OOK and FSK spectrum-sliced communication systems, in which both the signal and noise are stochastic processes, was analyzed. It was shown that when an optical preamplifier receiver is used, there exists an optimum m which minimizes the detection sensitivity (in terms of the average number of photons/bit) for a given error probability. Moreover the evaluated detection sensitivity presents an order of magnitude improvement over conventional detection techniques for such spectrum-sliced communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5629594","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of optical preamplification to optimize receiver sensitivity in spectrum-sliced WDM communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of optical preamplification to optimize receiver sensitivity in spectrum-sliced WDM communication systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028411S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4212","articleId":"571647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":571705,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

This significantly expands the search space, necessitating a heuristic approach, but also is much more reflective of actual communications network design problems.

Traditional statistical process control techniques are inadequate to address control problems in automated processes because of the high degree of data correlation characterized by such processes. Classical process control methods are unsuitable for the control of complex, nonlinear, multivariable processes. This paper discusses on-going research to design, develop, and implement a prototype that addresses product quality by monitoring and modifying, in real-time, dynamic, multivariable processes. The prototype is first described in terms of its components and then current results from testing the prototype are presented. It is anticipated that, when completed, the autonomous control system prototype will provide high level adaptation to changes in the plant, environment, and control objectives. It is also expected to enable real-time quality control of complex processes that do not lend themselves to control by traditional methods. For example, computer chip manufacturing involves a high degree of automation, characterized by significant data correlation. The proposed prototype is designed to handle this situation by using memory and learning techniques to incorporate the correlation into the process model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Evolutionary computation","Automatic control","Prototypes","Quality control","Process control","Control systems","Computer aided manufacturing","Manufacturing automation","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality control","neural nets","production engineering computing","real-time systems","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","evolutionary computation","real-time quality control","complex processes","statistical process control","data correlation","dynamic multivariable processes","autonomous control system prototype","computer chip manufacturing","learning techniques","memory techniques","automated quality control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RAMS.1997.571728","publicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4288/12344/00571728.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1997.571728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and evolutionary computation for real-time quality control of complex processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571728","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and evolutionary computation for real-time quality control of complex processes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571728/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5565877","conferenceDate":"13-16 Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Jan 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and evolutionary computation for real-time quality control of complex processes","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031114S","chronDate":"13-16 Jan 1997","isNumber":"12344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288","citationCount":"2","articleId":"571728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":571743,"authors":[{"name":"U.

This paper reviews the design requirements of SESAM's for stable pulse generation in both the mode-locked and Q-switched regime. The combination of device structure and material parameters for SESAM's provide sufficient design freedom to choose key parameters such as recovery time, saturation intensity, and saturation fluence, in a compact structure with low insertion loss. We have been able to demonstrate, for example, passive modelocking (with no Q-switching) using an intracavity saturable absorber in solid-state lasers with long upper state lifetimes (e.g., 1-/spl mu/m neodymium transitions), Kerr lens modelocking assisted with pulsewidths as short as 6.5 fs from a Ti:sapphire laser-the shortest pulses ever produced directly out of a laser without any external pulse compression, and passive Q-switching with pulses as short as 56 ps-the shortest pulses ever produced directly from a Q-switched solid-state laser.

Two operation regimes; synchronized; and nonsynchronized; and a hysteresis of the transition between the two regimes are clearly observed; while independent modelocking and tunability of the output pulse trains is found in both regimes. Pulses in the range from 15 to 100 fs are synchronized with a timing jitter below 2 fs. The combined effects of cross-phase modulation and negative group velocity dispersion are shown to be responsible for the strong pulse correlation in the synchronized regime. Our experimental observations are in agreement with numerical simulations, thus confirming the theoretical model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/12381/00571746.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/2944.571746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.571746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanism for self-synchronization of femtosecond pulses in a two-color Ti:sapphire laser","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Optical coupling","Optical pulses","Laser modes","Laser theory","Laser transitions","Hysteresis","Timing jitter","Dispersion","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["titanium","sapphire","solid lasers","hysteresis","jitter","colour","high-speed optical techniques","optical dispersion","laser tuning","laser mode locking","phase modulation","optical modulation","synchronisation","laser theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-synchronization","femtosecond pulses","two-color Ti:sapphire laser","nonlinear coupling mechanism","solitary pulses","two-color femtosecond laser","operation regimes","synchronized","nonsynchronized","hysteresis","independent modelocking","tunability","output pulse trains","timing jitter","cross-phase modulation","negative group velocity dispersion","strong pulse correlation","numerical simulations","15 to 100 fs","2 fs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Mechanism for self-synchronization of femtosecond pulses in a two-color Ti:sapphire laser","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5579085","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanism for self-synchronization of femtosecond pulses in a two-color Ti:sapphire laser","sourcePdf":"00571746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039935S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"12381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"58","articleId":"571746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":571747,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Analysis is focused on this last stage where pulses with peak powers corresponding to 10and 12-order solitons are fed at the fiber input end. Experimental results are well described using both the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation and an accurate intensity and phase model of the gain-switched laser diode. Experiments are shown to be correctly described only if both intrapulse stimulated Raman scattering and third-order dispersion are taken into account. Guidelines are then given to optimize the nonlinear fiber compression using laser diodes and fiber amplifiers. The influence of the third-order dispersion in the fiber compressor is first evaluated. Second, the nonlinear self-phase modulation induced in the fiber amplifier is studied. It is shown to be the main factor limiting any further pulse shortening with this technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5579089","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear optical compression of Er/sup 3+/-fiber amplified 1.5-/spl mu/m laser diode pulses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear optical compression of Er/sup 3+/-fiber amplified 1.5-/spl mu/m laser diode pulses","sourcePdf":"00571750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03623S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"12381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"6","articleId":"571750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":571751,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The various dynamic nonlinear terms of gain compression and associated self-phase modulation are derived semiphenomenologically, and are discussed physically. Included are the effects of carrier depletion, carrier heating and spectral hole-burning, as well as linear and two photon absorption and the instantaneous nonlinear index. Additionally, we account for dynamically changing gain curvature and slope. We apply the theory to strong signal cross-phase-cross-gain modulation experiments with /spl sim/500 fs pulses in a broad area GaAs amplifier and show that the model accurately describes the observed complex phenomena. We also present experimental results on single beam strong signal amplification in two different quantum-well amplifiers using 150-200 fs duration pulses. For such pulse lengths, carrier heating becomes an integrating nonlinearity and its self-phase modulation is similar to that due to carrier depletion. Additionally, since the pulse spectrum is broad, the gain slope and curvature shift and narrow it. The resultant spectral distortions are very different than observed (and modeled) earlier for the /spl sim/500 fs pulses. The model is again able to correctly describe the evolution of these ultrashort pulses, indicating that it remains valid, even though pulse durations approach the intraband relaxation time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond self- and cross-phase modulation in semiconductor laser amplifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/2944.571753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/12381/00571753.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.571753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond self- and cross-phase modulation in semiconductor laser amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5579092","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond self- and cross-phase modulation in semiconductor laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00571753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103696S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"12381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"85","articleId":"571753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":571754,"authors":[{"name":"F.X.

This work is aimed at overcoming the limitations for high-accuracy magnetometry of using water as an NMR substance.","doi":"10.1109/19.571784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.571784","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/12386/00571784.pdf","startPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optically pumped /sup 3/He NMR and atomic hydrogen ESR at 0.6 T","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571784/","displayDocTitle":"Optically pumped /sup 3/He NMR and atomic hydrogen ESR at 0.6 T","volume":"46","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5593506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optically pumped /sup 3/He NMR and atomic hydrogen ESR at 0.6 T","sourcePdf":"00571784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058927S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"7","articleId":"571784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":571800,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Semiconductor optical amplifiers have long been considered not suitable for CATV systems which transmit multi-channel AM-VSB video signals, due to the carrier-density-modulation induced second order nonlinear distortions (NLDs). However, despite the fact that these second-order NLD levels cannot be tolerated by AM-VSB signals, they may be acceptable to subcarrier-multiplexed digital video channels using M-QAM format. We use computer simulation techniques to investigate the potential and limitations of TWSOAs when used as external modulators at the transmitter end of multi-channel M-QAM CATV lightwave systems. We have numerically shown that by using 16/64-QAM and a TWSOA as an external modulator, one could transmit up to 400/600 MPEG2 video channels with an optical CATV digital link budget of 34/27 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of M-QAM compressed digital video signals transmission for CATV distribution networks using semiconductor optical amplifier as an external modulator","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings LEOS'96 9th Annual Meeting IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","doi":"10.1109/LEOS.1996.571959","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings LEOS'96 9th Annual Meeting IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","pdfPath":"/iel3/4212/12257/00571959.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"403 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LEOS.1996.571959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=571959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/571959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of M-QAM compressed digital video signals transmission for CATV distribution networks using semiconductor optical amplifier as an external modulator","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5643662","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of M-QAM compressed digital video signals transmission for CATV distribution networks using semiconductor optical amplifier as an external modulator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00571959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038311S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4212","citationCount":"1","articleId":"571959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":571962,"authors":[{"name":"F.B.

Their advantages are efficiency, and insensitivity to small changes in camera viewpoint. However, a histogram is a coarse characterization of an image, and so images with very different appearances can have similar histograms. We describe a technique for comparing images called histogram refinement, which imposes additional constraints on histogram based matching. Histogram refinement splits the pixels in a given bucket into several classes, based upon some local property. Within a given bucket, only pixels in the same class are compared. We describe a split histogram called a color coherence vector (CCV), which partitions each histogram bucket based on spatial coherence. CCVs can be computed at over 5 images per second on a standard workstation. A database with 15,000 images can be queried using CCVs in under 2 seconds. We demonstrate that histogram refinement can be used to distinguish images whose color histograms are indistinguishable.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACV.1996.572008","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision.

It can track a person's face while the person moves freely (e.g., walks, jumps, sits down and stands up) in a room. Three types of models have been employed in developing the system. First, they present a stochastic model to characterize skin color distributions of human faces. The information provided by the model is sufficient for tracking a human face in various poses and views. This model is adaptable to different people and different lighting conditions in real-time. Second, a motion model is used to estimate image motion and to predict the search window. Third, a camera model is used to predict and compensate for camera motion. The system can be applied to teleconferencing and many HCI applications including lip reading and gaze tracking. The principle in developing this system can be extended to other tracking problems such as tracking the human hand.","doi":"10.1109/ACV.1996.572043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACV.1996.572043","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision.

A TV camera is mounted above the highway to monitor the traffic through two slice windows for each traffic lane. One slice window is along the lane and the other perpendicular to the lane axis. Two types of 2D spatio-temporal (ST) images are used in the system: the panoramic view image (PVI) and the epipolar plane image (EPI). The real-time vision system for automatic traffic monitoring, VISATRAM, an inexpensive system with a PC 486 and an image frame grabber has been tested with real road images. Not only can the system count the vehicles and estimate their speeds, but it can also classify the passing vehicles using 3D measurements (length, width and height). The VISATRAM works robustly under various light conditions including shadows in the day and vehicle lights at night, and automatically copes with the gradual and abrupt changes of the environment.","doi":"10.1109/ACV.1996.572047","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision.

In order to ensure that the performance of an automatic fingerprint identification system (AFIS) will be robust with respect to the quality of input fingerprint images, it is essential to incorporate a fingerprint enhancement module in the AFIS system. We introduce a new fingerprint enhancement algorithm which decomposes the input fingerprint image into a set of filtered images. From the filtered images, the orientation field is estimated and a quality mask which distinguishes the recoverable and unrecoverable corrupted regions in the input image is generated. The input fingerprint image is adaptively enhanced in the recoverable regions. The performance of our algorithm has been evaluated on an online fingerprint verification system using the MSU fingerprint database containing over 600 fingerprint images. Experimental results show that our enhancement algorithm improves the performance of the online fingerprint verification system and makes it more robust with respect to the quality of input fingerprint images.","doi":"10.1109/ACV.1996.572056","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision.

The properties of SiO/sub 2/ films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are determined by the nature and composition of the plasma, which is in turn controlled by the deposition variables involved in the PECVD process. The complex nature of particle dynamics within a plasma makes it very difficult to quantify the exact relationship between deposition conditions and critical output parameters reflecting film quality. In this study, the synthesis and optimization of process recipes using genetic algorithms is introduced. In order to characterize the PECVD of SiO/sub 2/ films deposited under varying conditions, a central composite designed experiment has been performed. Data from this experiment was then used to develop neural network based process models. A recipe synthesis procedure was then performed using the optimized neural network models to generate the necessary deposition conditions to obtain several novel film qualities, including zero stress, 100% uniformity, low permittivity, and minimal impurity concentration. This synthesis procedure utilized genetic algorithms, Powell's algorithm, the simplex method, and hybrid combinations thereof. Recipes predicted by these techniques were verified by experiment, and the performance of each synthesis method are compared. It was found that the genetic algorithm-based recipes generally produced films of superior quality.

The development of accurate and efficient MOCVD process models is therefore desirable, since such models ran be instrumental in improving process control in a manufacturing environment. This paper presents a semi-empirical MOCVD model based on \"hybrid\" neural networks. The model is constructed by characterizing the MOCVD of titanium dioxide (TiO/sub 2/) films through the measurement of deposition rate over a range of deposition conditions by a statistically designed experiment in which susceptor and source temperature, flow rate of the carrier gas for the precursor and chamber pressure are varied. A modified backpropagation neural network is then trained on the experimental data to determine the value of the adjustable parameters in an analytical expression for the TiO/sub 2/ deposition rate. In so doing, a general purpose methodology for deriving semi-empirical neural process models which take into account prior knowledge of the underlying process physics is developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5570269","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semi-empirical neural network modeling of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-empirical neural network modeling of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition","sourcePdf":"00572084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049592S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"14","articleId":"572084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":572090,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we propose neural structures related to multilayer feedforward networks for performing complete ICA. The basic ICA network consists of whitening, separation, and basis vector estimation layers. It can be used for both blind source separation and estimation of the basis vectors of ICA.

In this paper, a new pruning method is developed, based on the idea of iteratively eliminating units and adjusting the remaining weights in such a way that the network performance does not worsen over the entire training set. The pruning problem is formulated in terms of solving a system of linear equations, and a very efficient conjugate gradient algorithm is used for solving it, in the least-squares sense. The algorithm also provides a simple criterion for choosing the units to be removed, which has proved to work well in practice. The results obtained over various test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/72.572092","startPage":"519","endPage":"531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/12383/00572092.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.572092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative pruning algorithm for feedforward neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Equations","Testing","Neurons","Iterative methods","Pattern recognition","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","iterative methods","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","learning (artificial intelligence)","conjugate gradient methods","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative pruning","feedforward neural networks","generalization","learning","conjugate gradient algorithm","hidden neurons","iterative methods","least-squares method","pattern recognition","structure simplification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"An iterative pruning algorithm for feedforward neural networks","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5594468","pubMedId":"18255656","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative pruning algorithm for feedforward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00572092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064269S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"181","articleId":"572092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":572093,"authors":[{"name":"E.I.

This technique can be used to efficiently implement the weighted summation operation (WSO) that are required in the realization of a general ANN. The sigmoidal transformation is inherently performed by the nonlinear transconductance amplifier, which is a key component in the current integrator used in the realization of WSO. The CM-PWM implementation results in a minimum silicon area, and therefore is suitable for very large scale neural systems. Other pronounced features of the CM-PWM implementation are its easy programmability, electronically adjustable gains of neurons, and modular structures. In this paper, all the current-mode CMOS circuits (building blocks) required for the realization of CM-PWM ANNs are presented and simulated. Four modules for modular design of ANNs are introduced. Also, it is shown that the CM-PWM technique is an efficient method for implementing discrete-time cellular neural networks (DT-CNNs). Two application examples are given: a winner-take-all circuit and a connected component detector.","doi":"10.1109/72.572093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"532","endPage":"548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/12383/00572093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.572093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementations of artificial neural networks using current-mode pulse width modulation technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse width modulation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Transconductance","Silicon","Large-scale systems","Neurons","Circuit simulation","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","pulse width modulation","cellular neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","current-mode PWM","pulse width modulation","weighted summation operation","nonlinear transconductance amplifier","modular structures","current-mode CMOS circuits","discrete-time cellular neural networks","winner-take-all circuit","connected component detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Implementations of artificial neural networks using current-mode pulse width modulation technique","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5594469","pubMedId":"18255657","publicationDate":"May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572093/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementations of artificial neural networks using current-mode pulse width modulation technique","sourcePdf":"00572093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057498S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"18","articleId":"572093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":572095,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, a convex hull computing neural network (CHCNN) is developed to solve the related problems in the N-dimensional spaces. The algorithm is based on a two-layered neural network, topologically similar to ART, with a newly developed adaptive training strategy called excited learning. The CHCNN provides a parallel online and real-time processing of data which, after training, yields two closely related approximations, one from within and one from outside, of the desired convex hull. It is shown that accuracy of the approximate convex hulls obtained is around O[K/sup -1/(N-1/)], where K is the number of neurons in the output layer of the CHCNN. When K is taken to be sufficiently large, the CHCNN can generate any accurate approximate convex hull. We also show that an upper bound exists such that the CHCNN will yield the precise convex hull when K is larger than or equal to this bound.

It studies the robustness performance of the algorithms in the presence of uncertainties that might be due to noisy perturbations in the reference signals or due to modeling mismatch. In particular, bounds are established on the step-size parameters in order to guarantee that the resulting algorithms will behave as robust filters. The paper also establishes that an intrinsic feedback structure can be associated with the training schemes. The feedback configuration is motivated via energy arguments and is shown to consist of two major blocks: a time-variant lossless (i.e., energy preserving) feedforward path and a time-variant feedback path. The stability of the feedback structure is then analyzed via the small gain theorem, and choices for the step-size parameter in order to guarantee faster convergence are deduced by using the mean-value theorem.

Due to the existence of irrelevant and redundant attributes, by selecting only the relevant attributes of the data, higher predictive accuracy can be expected from a machine learning method. In this paper, we propose the use of a three-layer feedforward neural network to select those input attributes that are most useful for discriminating classes in a given set of input patterns. A network pruning algorithm is the foundation of the proposed algorithm. By adding a penalty term to the error function of the network, redundant network connections can be distinguished from those relevant ones by their small weights when the network training process has been completed. A simple criterion to remove an attribute based on the accuracy rate of the network is developed. The network is retrained after removal of an attribute, and the selection process is repeated until no attribute meets the criterion for removal.

Five mutation operators proposed in EPNet reflect such an emphasis on evolving behaviors. Close behavioral links between parents and their offspring are maintained by various mutations, such as partial training and node splitting. EPNet evolves ANN's architectures and connection weights (including biases) simultaneously in order to reduce the noise in fitness evaluation. The parsimony of evolved ANN's is encouraged by preferring node/connection deletion to addition. EPNet has been tested on a number of benchmark problems in machine learning and ANNs, such as the parity problem, the medical diagnosis problems, the Australian credit card assessment problem, and the Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem. The experimental results show that EPNet can produce very compact ANNs with good generalization ability in comparison with other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/72.572107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.572107","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/12383/00572107.pdf","startPage":"694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new evolutionary system for evolving artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572107/","displayDocTitle":"A new evolutionary system for evolving artificial neural networks","volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5594483","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18255671","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new evolutionary system for evolving artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00572107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048154S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"608","articleId":"572107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":572108,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, we show that neural networks can, in fact, represent and classify structured patterns. The key idea underpinning our approach is the use of the so called \"generalized recursive neuron\", which is essentially a generalization to structures of a recurrent neuron. By using generalized recursive neurons, all the supervised networks developed for the classification of sequences, such as backpropagation through time networks, real-time recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, recurrent cascade correlation networks, and neural trees can, on the whole, be generalized to structures.

The proof of convergence during learning as well as conditions for invariance of the learned spatial representation are derived and then experimentally verified using the active vision system. We also demonstrate various active vision applications that benefit from the properties of the mapping learned by SOIM.","doi":"10.1109/72.572111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.572111","startPage":"758","endPage":"773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/12383/00572111.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOIM: a self-organizing invertible map with applications in active vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"SOIM: a self-organizing invertible map with applications in active vision","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5594487","pubMedId":"18255675","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572111/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOIM: a self-organizing invertible map with applications in active vision","sourcePdf":"00572111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042976S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"10","articleId":"572111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":572113,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The network makes use of two different activation functions. One is the traditional two-level sigmoid function, which is used at its hidden nodes, and the other is the M-level sigmoid function (MSF), which is used at the output node. The shape of the M-level activation function is controlled by two parameters: the slope and shifting parameters. The effect of these parameters on the learning performance is investigated through extensive simulations. In addition, the network is compared with a linear transversal equalizer, a decision feedback equalizer and a recently proposed RNN equalizer which has used a scaled sigmoid function (SSF) at its output node. Comparisons are made in terms of their learning properties and symbol error rates. It is demonstrated that the proposed RNN equalizer performs better, provided that the MSF parameters are properly selected.","doi":"10.1109/72.572113","startPage":"779","endPage":"783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.572113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12383","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/12383/00572113.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved recurrent neural network for M-PAM symbol detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572113/","displayDocTitle":"An improved recurrent neural network for M-PAM symbol detection","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5594489","pubMedId":"18255677","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved recurrent neural network for M-PAM symbol detection","sourcePdf":"00572113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065364S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"10","articleId":"572113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":572114,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"572114","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Sorting","Routing","Cost function","Neural networks","Design optimization","Pattern classification","Job production systems","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operations research","recurrent neural nets","duality (mathematics)","optimisation","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["primal assignment network","dual assignment networks","recurrent neural network architecture","complex connectivity","optimal assignment","sorting","shortest-path routing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572114","abstract":"This paper presents two recurrent neural networks for solving the assignment problem.

The theoretical comparison centers on robust stability and performance, which can be easily assessed for the PBC given its exponential stability property. On the other hand, we show that, (as expected from a scheme based on nonlinearity cancellations), in the face of parameter mismatch OBAC may become unstable even in the state feedback case. For our experimental studies we used standard low-cost hardware readily available in a practical application. The conclusions of our experimental comparison may be summarized as follows: 1) the high computational requirements of the OBAC forced us to double the sampling period achievable for PBC with obvious ensuing performance degradation; 2) even at a lower sampling frequency, PBC systematically achieved better speed transient performance, faster load torque disturbance rejection, and enhanced robustness vis a vis uncertainty in the rotor resistance; and 3) commissioning of PBC was also simpler, because the performance of OBAC is more sensitive to parameter uncertainty and its control effort was larger. The latter factor considerably limited the range of operation of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/87.572130","startPage":"338","endPage":"348","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/12384/00572130.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.572130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and experimental comparison of two nonlinear controllers for current-fed induction motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Sampling methods","Induction motors","Programmable control","Adaptive control","State feedback","Hardware","High performance computing","Degradation","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","state feedback","asymptotic stability","nonlinear control systems","observers","adaptive control","machine control","induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear controllers","current-fed induction motors","speed regulation","passivity-based controller","observer-based adaptive controller","robust stability","exponential stability property","nonlinearity cancellations","parameter mismatch","state feedback","low-cost hardware","computational requirements","sampling period","transient performance","load torque disturbance rejection","parameter uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and experimental comparison of two nonlinear controllers for current-fed induction motors","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5576322","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and experimental comparison of two nonlinear controllers for current-fed induction motors","sourcePdf":"00572130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150851S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"35","articleId":"572130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":572131,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Two control algorithms are presented, obtained extending to the multivariable case two control techniques previously proposed by the authors (1995) for single input-single output (SISO) systems. Both techniques consist of variable structure control laws cascaded to a generalized minimum variance controller. The former algorithm refers to a completely known system, while the latter has been designed to deal with parameter uncertainties in the plant. In this case, the connection with a MIMO online parameter estimator has been considered. Proofs are provided about the convergence of the proposed control laws. The presented algorithms have been applied to the problem of position and orientation control of an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) used in the exploitation of combustible gas deposits at great water depths. Resulting performances have been tested by simulation, modeling the ROV with a nonlinear differential equations system. Results have been discussed and compared with recent literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete adaptive variable-structure controller for MIMO systems, and its application to an underwater ROV","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/87.572131","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/12384/00572131.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.572131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A discrete adaptive variable-structure controller for MIMO systems, and its application to an underwater ROV","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5576323","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete adaptive variable-structure controller for MIMO systems, and its application to an underwater ROV","sourcePdf":"00572131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084043S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"95","articleId":"572131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":572151,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Three features contribute to the observed linearly polarized states of emission: linear birefringence, linear gain or loss anisotropies, and an intermediate relaxation rate for imbalances in the populations of the magnetic sublevels. In the absence of either birefringence or saturable dispersion, the gain or loss anisotropies dictate stability for the linearly polarized mode with higher net gain; hence, switching is only possible if the relative strength of the net gain for the two modes is reversed. When birefringence and saturable dispersion are both present, there are possibilities of bistability, monostability, and dynamical instability, including switching by destabilization of the mode with the higher gain to loss ratio in favor of the weaker mode. We compare our analytical and numerical results with recent experimental results on bistability and switchings caused by changes in the injection current and changes in the intensity of an injected optical signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572151/","volume":"33","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5574706","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Polarization properties of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization properties of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers","sourcePdf":"00572151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068943S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"390","articleId":"572151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":572156,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Our approach, which is similar to optical character recognition, categorizes discrete regions of space (topographical nodes) using actual mapped sonar data from two different mobile robots. That is, the mapped sonar data assumes the form of a character unique to its respective region, thereby allowing an autonomous vehicle to determine which room it is in without knowing how or when it got there. With a robust exploration routine, this GSL solution can be time-, translation-, and rotation-invariant. The GSL solution can also become independent of the mobile robot used to collect the sensor data. This suggests that a single robot can transfer its knowledge of various learned regions to other mobile robots. This paper describes the exploration routine and the type of neural network used to solve the GSL problem. It also examines the impact and feasibility of two differently configured robots sharing knowledge on various levels.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1996.572238","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE/SICE/RSJ International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (Cat.

We stabilized the unstable equilibrium state of a chaotic network by a small external signal. The network has the first-order and second-order random and diluted connections, and its dynamics can be stable, periodic and chaotic for different values of parameters. The famous OGY method for controlling the chaos is applied to the evolution equation of the network. The controlling algorithm is efficient and convenient. When the algorithm is used to the chaotic network, the iterating sequence is stabilized at the equilibrium point after several iterations and it becomes chaotic again when the control is disabled, as shown by the numerical experiments. The control process can be regarded as the information integration between the network modules while the controlling signal being regarded as the information from other modules. A two-module architecture for information integration is proposed based on the controlling method.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1996.572315","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE/SICE/RSJ International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (Cat.

So, the image information signals are processed in parallel in each LSI and the processings are performed in pipelines over all the system. In this study we design the test chip which performs edge detection by Laplacian operator. In CAD simulation, the processing time of the edge detection takes about 10 /spl mu/sec using 2 /spl mu/m CMOS design rule. In fabrication, grinding and chemical-mechanical polishing techniques are used to thin the wafer to 30 /spl mu/m. The thinned wafer with buried interconnections is bonded vertically to a thick wafer through micro-bumps after careful alignment by the newly developed wafer aligner with the alignment tolerance of 1 /spl mu/m.

The unconstrained neurons which have the free state variable, could be stable at any arbitrary point in the solution space or trapped by un-intentional effects. These may introduce errors. For the unconstrained network, the solution could be different from the expected one due to the discrepancy in the energy function of the network and the objective function to be optimized. In addition, if the state variable is limited by some neighboring saturated transistors, un-desirable results may be obtained. The G/sub m/C-style SCN model can ensure the convergence of the network and avoid discrepancy between the energy function of the network and the objective function. The state resistor is also eliminated in the G/sub m/C model so that high cell-density can be achieved. Simulation results show that the proposed model is effective in significantly reducing optimization error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A state-constrained model for cellular nonlinear network optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.572341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/12398/00572341.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.572341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A state-constrained model for cellular nonlinear network optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5582311","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A state-constrained model for cellular nonlinear network optimization","sourcePdf":"00572341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035427S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"6","articleId":"572341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":572345,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The real-time programmable spatial convolution is generated for all pixels in parallel during the exposure. The 2-D convolution is performed by shifting a charge pattern in two dimensions and the exposure time is varied in proportion to the weight of each kernel coefficient. The problem of negative weights can be solved by taking the difference of two convolutions each with only positive weights. The CCD was fabricated using a standard CMOS/CCD process. Convolutions have been performed with a variety of linear filters that are commonly used in machine vision. Typical rms deviations from the ideal filter characteristics are between 1-2% of the largest kernel tap value. Results and practical applications of this work are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart CCD image sensor with real-time programmable parallel convolution capabilities","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.572345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/12398/00572345.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.572345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A smart CCD image sensor with real-time programmable parallel convolution capabilities","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5582315","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart CCD image sensor with real-time programmable parallel convolution capabilities","sourcePdf":"00572345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031111S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"5","articleId":"572345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":572346,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37349443500"},{"name":"Chai Wah Wu","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chai Wah Wu","id":"37276424300"},{"name":"L.O.

(1) A two-step half-conductive-state technique was used to control the conductivity of latch transistors, thus minimizing the time delay caused by bit-line stray capacitance. (2) The 'split-block row decoder' technique enabled the decoder layout within the 2.9- mu m cell pitch required for 16-Mbit integration density. The three transistors that are required per word line were split into two and one, placed on both sides of each word line, and alternately reversed on each side of the 2-Mbit cell array. (3) Additional dummy cells were added to the vacant spaces resulting from use of a twisted bit-line architecture, which reduces stray capacitance between adjacent bit lines. The overhead space required for all the dummy cells and twisted bit lines was thus held at 2.6 percent of the entire chip area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Capacitance","Decoding","Conductivity","Latches","CMOS technology","Delay effects","Capacitors","Integrated circuit technology","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","integrated memory circuits","random-access storage","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic RAM","DRAM","minimized sensing delay","bit-line stray capacitance","new techniques","CMOS","two-step half-conductive-state technique","latch transistors","split-block row decoder","decoder layout","cell pitch","dummy cells","twisted bit-line architecture","overhead space","16 Mbit","60 ns"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572575","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.1989.572575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/1494/00572575.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.1989.572575","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-ns 16-Mbit DRAM with a minimized sensing delay caused by bit-line stray capacitance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60-ns 16-Mbit DRAM with a minimized sensing delay caused by bit-line stray capacitance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3561565","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-ns 16-Mbit DRAM with a minimized sensing delay caused by bit-line stray capacitance","sourcePdf":"00572575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035606S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"572575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":572576,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The array architecture, based on the twisted-bit-line (TBL) array, includes suitable dummy and space word-line configurations which suppress the inter-bit-line noise and bring yield improvement. The multipurpose register (MPR) designed for the hierarchical data bus structure provides a line-mode test (LMT), copy write, and cache access capability. The LMT with on-chip test circuits using the MPR and a comparator creates a random test pattern and reduces the test time to 1/1000. A field shield isolation and a T-shaped stacked capacitor allow the layout of a 4.8- mu m/sup 2/ cell size with a storage capacitance of 35 fF. These techniques enable the 3.3-V 16-Mbit DRAM to achieve a 60-ns RAS access time and 300-mW power dissipation at 120-ns cycle time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.1989.572576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/1494/00572576.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.1989.572576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-ns 3.3-V-only 16-Mbit DRAM with multipurpose register","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"A 60-ns 3.3-V-only 16-Mbit DRAM with multipurpose register","volume":"24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","accessionNumber":"3561566","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572576/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-ns 3.3-V-only 16-Mbit DRAM with multipurpose register","sourcePdf":"00572576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035659S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"13","articleId":"572576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":572578,"authors":[{"name":"Daeje Chin","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Daeje Chin","id":"37087551149"},{"name":"Changhyun Kim","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Changhyun Kim","id":"37087172530"},{"name":"Yunho Choi","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yunho Choi","id":"37087548960"},{"name":"Dong-sun Min","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-sun Min","id":"37087562532"},{"name":"Hong Sun Hwang","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong Sun Hwang","id":"37087561901"},{"name":"Hoon Choi","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoon Choi","id":"37088784710"},{"name":"Sooin Cho","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sooin Cho","id":"37087396387"},{"name":"Tae Young Chung","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Young Chung","id":"37085930840"},{"name":"Chan J.

A parallel-word-access redundancy architecture, which causes no access time penalty, was also incorporated. A polysilicon PMOS load memory cell, which had a large on-current-to-off-current ratio, gave a much lower soft-error rate than a conventional high-resistance polysilicon load cell. The 1-Mbit SRAM, fabricated using a half-micrometer, triple-poly, and double-metal CMOS technology, operated at a single supply voltage of 5 V.

Fast access time is obtained by a combination of advanced technology, double-layer metal (DLM), differential sensing, address transition detection (ATD), and a ground-switched decoding scheme. DLM is used to strap word lines. High performance is obtained by reducing bit-line length to 256 cells, with 2048 cells per word line. The combination of strapped word lines along with short bit lines produces very fast access time. The active power is 75 mA, and standby power is 9 mA at room temperature.

Developed from a 1.0- mu m EPROM-base technology, the 15.2- mu m/sup 2/ single-transistor EPROM tunnel oxide (ETOX) cell requires only 42 percent of the area required by the previous 1.5- mu m device. One of the most significant aspects of this 1-Mbit flash memory is the one-million erase/program cycle capability. The 1-Mbit memory exhibits 90-ns read access time while the reprogramming performance gives a 900-ms array erase time and a 10- mu s/byte programming rate. Ample erase and program margins through one-million erase/program cycles are guaranteed by the internal verify circuits. Column redundancy is implemented with the utilization of flash memory cells to store repaired addresses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","accessionNumber":"3561577","volume":"24","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 90-ns one-million erase/program cycle 1-Mbit flash memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 90-ns one-million erase/program cycle 1-Mbit flash memory","sourcePdf":"00572591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054715S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"46","articleId":"572591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":572608,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Four key results are obtained. One is that the I/sub BB/ of conventional BiCMOS drivers is unacceptably high, i.e, three times larger than that of CMOS drivers. Another is that the excessive I/sub BB/ of BiCMOS drivers is generated by the saturation of bipolar transistors, which results from a collector voltage decrease caused by large amounts of collector current flowing through the collector saturation resistance r/sub cs/. The third result concerns proposals for I/sub BB/ reduction techniques. One features two collector outputs terminals for avoiding the r/sub cs/ effect and the other features application of a low supply voltage for the base. The last result is that BiCMOS drivers using the I/sub BB/ reduction techniques make it possible to achieve 1-Mbit BiCMOS DRAM'S with I/sub BB/ levels comparable to those of conventional CMOS DRAM's.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.1989.572619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/1494/00572619.pdf","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.1989.572619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Substrate current reduction techniques for BiCMOS DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Substrate current reduction techniques for BiCMOS DRAM","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","accessionNumber":"3572156","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Substrate current reduction techniques for BiCMOS DRAM","sourcePdf":"00572619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036267S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"572619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":572620,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This high performance is achieved by using a soft-error-immune switched-load-resistor memory cell with clamp transistors, an upward-transistor decoder utilizing a SIdewall-base COntact Structure (SICOS) upward transistor for the AND gate, a Darlington word driver with advanced discharge circuits, and 0.8- mu m SICOS technology. High-load and low-load resistors in this new memory cell are formed by using double-layer polysilicon for the base and emitter electrodes in the SICOS structure. This results in a small cell size (498 mu m/sup 2/) and a reasonable chip size (85.8 mm/sup 2/). An accelerated soft-error test using americium alpha source shows that the new 64-kbit RAM has sufficient soft-error immunity, in spite of its small cell capacitance which is about one third that of conventional RAM's. In addition to the new memory cell, the upward-transistor decoder and the Darlington word driver with advanced discharge circuits make it possible to realize a high-speed, large-capacity bipolar RAM, while maintaining soft-error immunity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.1989.572620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/1494/00572620.pdf","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.1989.572620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental soft-error-immune 64-kbit 3-ns ECL bipolar RAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572620/","displayDocTitle":"An experimental soft-error-immune 64-kbit 3-ns ECL bipolar RAM","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3537319","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental soft-error-immune 64-kbit 3-ns ECL bipolar RAM","sourcePdf":"00572620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113973S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","articleId":"572620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":572626,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This circuit is composed of multistage delay units in matrix form. In each unit, delay time is finely controlled by loading transistor junction capacitance on an LCML inverter gate and is roughly done by the serial stage numbers of the gate. A dedicated delay-unit IC has been built by an Si bipolar process called SST-1A. The circuit demonstrates a high delay-time resolution of 10 ps at a clock rate of up to 1 GHz. Furthermore, an innovative process-insensitive design technique based on a polynomial formulation for the delay time is proposed.

The digital library discussed was developed from an existing set of 3- mu m standard cells, data-path cells, and logic macrocells which were modified and augmented with analog cells. The library is compatible with public-domain software for logic synthesis, place and route, simulation, and layout. The authors compare the use of these tools with other commercial systems suitable for mixed analog/digital CMOS IC design. Analog library construction utilizes a set of prototype tools to reduce the time spent in the design, layout, and simulation cycle.

Present stability results, that are extensions of classical Lyapunov theory, are not straightforward to apply in general due to two reasons. First, existing theory do not unveil how to find needed Lyapunov functions. Secondly, at some time instants it is necessary to know the values of the continuous trajectory. Because of these drawbacks, stronger conditions for stability are suggested. The search for Lyapunov functions can then be formulated as a linear matrix inequality problem. Additionally, it is shown how to obtain robustness properties. An example illustrates the results.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.572653","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12375/00572653.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1207 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.572653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and robustness for hybrid systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572653/","displayDocTitle":"Stability and robustness for hybrid systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5527206","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and robustness for hybrid systems","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00572653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042147S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"125","articleId":"572653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":572667,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It deals with matching high resolution local depth maps against a large, onboard, low resolution reference map. The matching algorithm locates the local depth map within the a priori larger map to determine absolute position and heading of the vehicle. It uses cliff maps which are steep gradient contours extracted from both local and reference maps. This segmentation provides us with a means to extract critical points, which are defined as high curvature values. The problem is reduced to a singular point-based matching algorithm: given two point sets, find correspondences and estimate transformation between the two sets. In order to register maps at different scales, a part of this study will focus on partial differential equations based scale-space techniques. This approach is tested using real terrain data of the Var underwater canyon (France).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/572788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1996","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5527093","displayDocTitle":"A terrain referenced underwater positioning using sonar bathymetric profiles and multiscale analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A terrain referenced underwater positioning using sonar bathymetric profiles and multiscale analysis","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00572788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037229S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1996","isNumber":"12399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4196","citationCount":"11","articleId":"572788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":572803,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Wang","affiliation":["Automation Department, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xudong Wang","id":"37087169677"},{"name":"Rongfu Luo","affiliation":["Automation Department, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Rongfu Luo","id":"37087490880"},{"name":"Huihe Shao","affiliation":["Automation Department, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Huihe Shao","id":"37087168473"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3590-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"572803","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=572803","abstract":"A soft sensor is a model which is used to estimate the unmeasurable output of an industrial process, it is very useful in process control because it can be used to control and monitor many industrial processes. But designing a soft sensor is usually difficult because its modeling is often based on case data. These data have the features of discreteness, nonlinearity, contradiction, and complexity. In this paper, modeling based on case data is defined as a case based modeling problem. In order to solve the case based modeling, problem and successfully design a sort sensor, this paper constructs a kind of fuzzy distributed radial basis function neural network. The fuzzy distributed RBP neural network is easy to solve the case based modeling problem. In this paper, it is applied in designing a soft sensor for a high purity distillation column. The simulation is based on the actual operation data and analysis data of the distillation column.

In comparison with the backpropagation (BP) and RPE based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm, called UD-RPE, can provide much more accurate learning results in fewer iterations with fewer hidden nodes and improve convergence rate and numerical stability (robustness). In addition, it is less sensitive to start-up parameters, such as initial weights and initial covariance matrix, and the randomness in the observed data. It also has good generalization ability and needs less learning time.

Based on recent industry shifts, it has become clear that HDLs are rapidly becoming an integral part of design automation environments. This will create a demand for future engineers who are well-trained in HDL-based design methodologies. It has become necessary to introduce related courses at the undergraduate level.

While many papers have been published describing power-saving techniques for use in digital systems, trade-offs between the methods are rarely discussed. We address this issue by using an energy-delay metric to compare many of the proposed techniques. Using this metric also provides insight into some of the basic trade-offs in low-power design. The next section describes the energy-loss mechanisms that are present in CMOS circuits, which provides the parameters that must be changed to lower the power dissipation. With these factors in mind, the rest of the paper reviews the energy saving techniques that have been proposed. These proposals fall into one of three main strategies: trade speed for power, do not waste power, and find a lower power problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573184/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5093352","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-power digital design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power digital design","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00573184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050055S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","isNumber":"12416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4326","citationCount":"200","articleId":"573184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":573187,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

The overall efficiency is increased and the power converter's volume is reduced in the DIC converter. These and other improved design characteristics make this alternative topology more attractive than the isolated boost for equivalent applications.

This can be achieved by controlling the battery charging rate especially near the end of the charge cycle. Different charging algorithms have been devised to achieve this goal for individual battery modules. However, extending these algorithms to series connected battery stacks is not as straightforward. Normal differences in cell chemistries and temperature gradients along a battery stack can lead to large nonuniformities in cell charge levels. Maintenance of cells at an equalized charge level is critical for enhancing battery life. Different systems and schemes have been proposed to attain this goal.

Soft switching of the DC/AC H-Bridge converter is realized by paralleling two auxiliary switches and a magnetic amplifier with the load. The auxiliary switches are turned on at a predetermined time before the commutation of the main switches. The magnetic amplifier then automatically determines the necessary amount of redirection current to ensure soft switching of all switches under any load conditions. This method requires no expensive sensors or complex control circuitry. It is ideal for class-D audio power amplifiers where the load current is widely changing. Further applications include DC/DC converters, motor drivers, UPS, communication, and space applications where high efficiency, low EMI and small size are crucial.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5558367","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent magnetic amplifier controlled soft-switching method for amplifiers/inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent magnetic amplifier controlled soft-switching method for amplifiers/inverters","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00573411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03849S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4202","articleId":"573411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":573431,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.573453","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12402/00573453.pdf","startPage":"2426","endPage":"2431 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.573453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive decoupling design for generalized predictive control with neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive decoupling design for generalized predictive control with neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5534264","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive decoupling design for generalized predictive control with neural network","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00573453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039878S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"8","articleId":"573453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":573465,"authors":[{"name":"M.Q.

The system learns by repeated trials, each starting from the same initial conditions. Data from multiple trials can used to identify a model of the system during the finite time interval of interest. A learning controller is then designed from the identified model. If the identification is perfect, the necessary control can be computed directly from the identified model, and there is no need for learning. If the identification is not perfect, the remaining error can be corrected by learning control.

To tackle this problem, this paper presents an anti-windup controller which provides graceful degradation of closed-loop performance for saturating discrete-time MIMO systems. The present anti-windup scheme achieves its goals by minimizing the euclidean norm of the weighted difference between the performance of the saturating system and that of the unsaturated linear system. This optimal performance problem is solved under a renewed generalized conditioning technique. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique optimal solution and the unique optimal anti-windup control law are obtained. Stability of the saturating system is also discussed.

The aim of the paper is to show that the ergodicity property of a second-order stochastic process is preserved by WTs. Moreover, under some soft constraints for wavelet functions, the WT of a second-order process with wide-sense stationary increments/jumps or wide-sense stationary (WSS) property is WSS and ergodic if the process is ergodic. The fractional Brownian motion (fBm) processes have been used in many research areas of 1/f-type noises, fractals, image textures, etc.. But, these researches did not deal with the calculation problems of the fBm processes in practice. Actually, the ergodicity property of the fBm process is not concluded by the ergodicity theorem. In our work, the ergodicity property of the WT of an fBm process would be certified too.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12402/00573604.pdf","startPage":"3107","endPage":"3112 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.573604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.573604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=573604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ergodicity and stationarity property analysis of nonstationary stochastic processes using wavelet transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Discrete wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Wavelet transforms","1f noise","Fractals","Control engineering","Image texture","H infinity control","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","stochastic processes","Brownian motion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodicity","stationarity property analysis","nonstationary stochastic processes","wavelet transforms","second-order stochastic processes","continuous-time","discrete-time","soft constraints","wide-sense stationary increments/jumps","wide-sense stationary property","fractional Brownian motion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"The ergodicity and stationarity property analysis of nonstationary stochastic processes using wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5534374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ergodicity and stationarity property analysis of nonstationary stochastic processes using wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00573604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027943S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"2","articleId":"573604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":573619,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The main content of this paper is to derive explicit bounds for the number of samples required to estimate this probability with a certain accuracy and confidence apriori specified. It is shown that the number obtained is inversely proportional to these thresholds and it is much smaller than that of classical results.

We begin by reviewing the state-of-the-art CMOS technology at 0.25 /spl mu/m currently in development, covering a logic-oriented processes and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) processes. CMOS transistor structures are compared by introducing a figure of merit. We then examine scaling guidelines for 0.1 /spl mu/m which has started to deviate for optimized performance from the classical theory of constant-field scaling. This highlights the problem of nontrivial subthreshold current associated with the scaled-down CMOS with low threshold voltages. Interconnect issues are then considered to assess the performance of microprocessors in 0.1 /spl mu/m technology. 0.1 /spl mu/m technology will enable a microprocessor which runs at 1000 MHz with 500 million transistors. Challenges below 0.1 /spl mu/m are then addressed. New transistor and circuit possibilities such as silicon on insulator (SOI), dynamic-threshold (DT) MOSFET, and back-gate input MOS (BMOS) are discussed. Two problems below 0.1 /spl mu/m are highlighted. They are threshold voltage control and pattern printing. It is pointed out that the threshold voltage variations due to doping fluctuations is a limiting factor for scaling CMOS transistors for high performance. The problem with lithography below 0.1 /spl mu/m is the low throughput for a single probe. The use of massively parallel scanning probe assemblies working over the entire wafer is suggested to overcome the problem of low throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","publicationDate":"April 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5594747","volume":"85","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Technology challenges for integration near and below 0.1 /spl mu/m","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology challenges for integration near and below 0.1 /spl mu/m","sourcePdf":"00573738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114936S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"64","articleId":"573738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":573739,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In application-specific architectures for real-time multidimensional signal processing, a significant cost in terms of chip area and power consumption is due to these background memory units. The multidimensional signals are usually modeled in behavioral descriptions with array variables. In the algorithmic specifications of our target applications, many of the array references cover large amounts of scalars. Therefore, the efficient handling of array references in the specifications for image and video processing is crucial for obtaining low cost memory allocation solutions. This paper addresses a central problem which arises when handling the array variables in behavioral specifications: the computation of the number of scalars covered by an array reference. This problem is closely related to the computation of dependences in data-flow analysis.

In this paper, we propose two novel approaches for multiway circuit partitioning to overcome this limitation. Our approaches allow each cell to move more than once. Our first approach still uses the locking mechanism but in a relaxed way. It introduces the phase concept such that each pass can include more than one phase, and a phase can include at most one move of each cell. Our second approach does not use the locking mechanism at all. It introduces the mobility concept such that each cell can move as freely as allowed by its mobility. Each approach leads to KL-based generic algorithms whose parameters can be set to obtain algorithms with different performance characteristics. We generated three versions of each generic algorithm and evaluated them on a subset of common benchmark circuits in comparison with Sanchis' algorithm (FMS) and the simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient, they outperform FMS significantly, and they perform comparably to SA. Our algorithms perform relatively better as the number of parts in the partition increases as well as the density of the circuit decreases. This paper also provides guidelines for good parameter settings for the generic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/43.573831","startPage":"169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/12440/00573831.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.573831","endPage":"178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two novel multiway circuit partitioning algorithms using relaxed locking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Two novel multiway circuit partitioning algorithms using relaxed locking","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5578827","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two novel multiway circuit partitioning algorithms using relaxed locking","sourcePdf":"00573831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053528S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"573831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":573832,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Sheng Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuh-Sheng Lee","id":"37657303100"},{"name":"A.C.-H.

Initially, nets are routed sequentially according to their criticalities and routabilities. The nets/paths violating the routing-resource and timing constraints are then resolved iteratively by a rip-up-and-rerouter, which is guided by a simulated evolution based optimization technique.

New forms of the governing equations for the multislice model are derived, which allow the meshes of multislices to be taken as one 2-D mesh so that the algorithm is very similar to that of general 2-D problems. Special techniques required for the mesh generation in the multislice model and the salient structures of the software are also described. The results obtained by using the program being developed have very good correlation with test data.","doi":"10.1109/20.573842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/12450/00573842.pdf","startPage":"2265","endPage":"2273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.573842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive approach to the solution of direct-coupled multislice model of skewed rotor induction motors using time-stepping eddy-current finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=573842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573842/","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive approach to the solution of direct-coupled multislice model of skewed rotor induction motors using time-stepping eddy-current finite element method","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587878","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive approach to the solution of direct-coupled multislice model of skewed rotor induction motors using time-stepping eddy-current finite element method","sourcePdf":"00573842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04179S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"51","articleId":"573842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":573846,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

One reason for the lack of realism in many existing artificial neural network models is that the dynamics of the human brain have not been captured. The difficulty partially arises from the lack of mathematical representation that can more easily express the dynamics of the brain. This paper introduces a network model that can be used to incorporate the global dynamic data of the brain. In particular, this project has incorporated into a Fukushima (1984) based network a set of data that has been obtained from a true recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) potential of the human subject, who was in a light sleep condition. The incorporation of the EEG data into an artificial neural network is important, since biological neurons never achieve a stable state, unless they are dead or in deep anesthesia. In addition, some physiological findings have suggested that neurons in different parts of the brain might communicate with each other through oscillation of synchronous electrical activity at 40 hertz (Barinaga, 1990). This study has shown that the new network model is able to achieve the pattern associative capabilities of the original model.","doi":"10.1109/ANZIIS.1996.573897","startPage":"92","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Australian New Zealand Conference on Intelligent Information Systems.

The meaning of variance of epistasis is analyzed using Walsh basis; it is established that this variance can be viewed as a measure of the quality of a linear approximation. Variance of epistasis is therefore easier to estimate using the well known context of polynomial approximation regarding Euclidian distance. This approach also leads to the extension of variance of epistasis to real encoding without considering the notion of schema. Following this new definition, numerical analysis tools can also be applied to compute efficiently this generalized variance of epistasis.","doi":"10.1109/ANZIIS.1996.573954","startPage":"268","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"1996 Australian New Zealand Conference on Intelligent Information Systems.

In this paper, an approach to handle constraints in GA with the use of constraint satisfaction principles is proposed to overcome those drawbacks. Each chromosome representing a set of constrained variables in GA is interpreted as an instance of the same constraint satisfaction problem represented by a constraint network. Dynamic constraint consistency checking and constraint propagation is performed during the main GA simulation process. Unfeasible solutions are detected and eliminated from the search space at early stages of the GA simulation process without requiring the problem specific representation or generation operators to provide feasible solutions. Constraint satisfaction is applied actively in GA during initialisation, crossover and mutation operations to advantage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/573956/","accessionNumber":"5534627","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using constraint satisfaction in genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using constraint satisfaction in genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00573956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033185S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272","citationCount":"1","articleId":"573956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":573957,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Effective fitness of an individual depends both on its functional value and age. Age of a newly generated individual is taken as zero and every iteration is increased by one. As in nature, adult individuals are considered more fit for genetic operations, compared to young and old ones. The model aims to emulate the natural genetic system in a more natural way. The effectiveness of this concept is demonstrated by solving complex function optimization problems. Results show that the scheme provides enhanced performance and maintains more diversity in the population thereby allowing the species to be robust to trace the changing environment.","doi":"10.1109/ANZIIS.1996.573957","startPage":"276","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Australian New Zealand Conference on Intelligent Information Systems.

They are the binary coded GA and the order-based GA. We have proposed a new type of binary coded GA, called the forking GA (fGA), as a kind of multi-population GA, and showed that the searching power of the fGA is superior to that of the standard GA. The distinguishing feature of the fGA is that it does population forking and different sub-populations search different non-overlapping sub-spaces of the entire search space in parallel. In this paper, the concept of population forking is extended to ordered representation based GAs with an aim to handle permutational problems. We call this new scheme o-fGA. In this context, we define two measures (bias and salient schema) to detect the state of convergence for the ordered representation based GAs. Experimental results for the blind traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and two job-shop scheduling problems show that population forking is also effective for this sort of problem.","doi":"10.1109/ANZIIS.1996.573959","startPage":"280","endPage":"283","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 Australian New Zealand Conference on Intelligent Information Systems.

A great research and development effort has therefore started, and is still in progress, to fulfill the requirements of modern commercial satellite networks, namely: low-cost user equipments on one side and power and spectral efficiency on the other. The aim of this contribution is to address the main topics in the development of such systems for satellite-based mobile and personal communications. More specifically, we investigate first the inherent trade-off between coding and spreading, then we touch upon the techniques for the minimisation of the self-noise effect, and the related issues of power control, multi-user detection and satellite diversity. As a key factor in the successful deployment of CDMA networks, we shortly review some technological aspects related to an efficient modem design via digital signal processing techniques, and the possible consequent low-cost, small-size application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation. The final part of the paper deals with some system-related issues, like the effect of the nonlinear satellite transponder and the mobile multipath channel on the multiplexed user signal, and highlights the applicability of CDMA to the emerging new-generation services, such as digital audio broadcasting (DAB), wideband mobile networks, and the like.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.1994.574153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Second Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Second Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel2/4361/12469/00574153.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.1994.574153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS-CDMA techniques for mobile and personal satellite communications: An overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574153/","displayDocTitle":"DS-CDMA techniques for mobile and personal satellite communications: An overview","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5106784","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS-CDMA techniques for mobile and personal satellite communications: An overview","confLoc":"Louvain la Neuve, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00574153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061521S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov 1994","isNumber":"12469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4361","citationCount":"4","articleId":"574153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":574162,"authors":[{"name":"A.

OFDM offers robustness against significant channel degradation by dispersion. For wireless LANs, the design of the transmitter power amplifier and the characteristics of the modulated signal are key factors deciding the coverage range performance and the product cost. The peak-envelope-power of the transmitter power amplifier is an important parameter in the design of small sized, low power wireless LAN devices. This paper describes an OFDM system with a data encoder/decoder that improves the peak-to-average power ratio of the transmitted signal. In this scheme, the data to be transmitted is converted into symbols for the individual subcarriers, such that the resultant of a pair of symmetrically positioned subcarriers is orthogonal to the resultant of another pair of subcarriers with the same center of symmetry. This conversion gives a reduced ratio between peak envelope-power and the mean (RMS) power, which reduces constraints on the power stage design. Further, the impact on the bit-error rate of clipping the signal in the transmitter before the output amplifier is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM encoding with reduced crestfactor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Second Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.1994.574162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Second Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel2/4361/12469/00574162.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.1994.574162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"OFDM encoding with reduced crestfactor","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5106793","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM encoding with reduced crestfactor","confLoc":"Louvain la Neuve, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00574162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033154S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov 1994","isNumber":"12469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4361","citationCount":"2","articleId":"574162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":574185,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

To establish these results, we present a new design methodology which leads to innovative developments. For control problems of a general nature, the most efficient methodologies of attack, yet devised, are the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, maximum principle and Lyapunov's concept. This paper elaborates a general procedure to solve the constrained optimization problem using the dynamic programming method. Instead of encountering difficulties via the calculus of variations or Pontryagin's maximum principle, we develop a feasible and computationally efficient optimization algorithm. This involves the application of a new nonquadratic functional as well as modified mappings of control and state bounds. A particular class of nonquadratic, sufficiently smooth and real-valued positive-definite performance integrands is selected. The functional depends on the state and control variables and associated bounds. These constraints limit a set of solutions as well as a class of control structures from which an optimal algorithm can be found. The nonquadratic, continuously differentiable return functions are used. Our approach simplifies optimization issues and allows one to solve the bounded control problem for high-order dynamical systems. The approach is presented through illustrations. Analytical and numerical results are given.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.574374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12410","startPage":"541","endPage":"546 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12410/00574374.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained optimization and control of nonlinear systems: new results in optimal control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"Constrained optimization and control of nonlinear systems: new results in optimal control","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5526631","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained optimization and control of nonlinear systems: new results in optimal control","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00574374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036429S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"30","articleId":"574374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":574389,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The concept of parallel distributed compensation is employed to design fuzzy controllers from the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. New stability conditions are obtained by relaxing the stability conditions derived in previous papers. The stability analysis of the feedback system is reduced to a problem of finding a common Lyapunov function for a set of linear matrix inequalities. Convex optimization techniques involving LMIs are utilized to find a common Lyapunov function. A procedure to design the fuzzy controller is constructed using the parallel distributed compensation and the relaxed stability conditions. Some stability issues are remarked.

A listing of these would constitute a veritable litany of moves to improve the quality of human life and to protect both the people and their environments from hazards of various sorts. Recently upon the scene is a most striking and fascinating new challenge: the protection of civil engineering structures from hazards such as earthquakes, winds, and related phenomena. With many of the same motives which have led to the surge of engineering interest in low-power electrical circuits and systems, this new application would also profit greatly from control means which can operate when power systems are down, and which cannot harm inherently stable structures by undergoing operational failures after their installation. A very exciting new class of actuators for such purposes is found in magnetorheological dampers. In this paper, we survey the physical background of this device, its mathematical modelling, and current control experiments on a 3 DOF laboratory structure equipped with such protection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shock absorbers","Damping","Hazards","Power system protection","Control engineering","Humans","Layout","Civil engineering","Earthquakes","Surges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["civil engineering","earthquakes","vibration control","damping","rheology","fluidic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetorheological dampers","seismic protection","civil engineering structures","earthquakes","winds","mathematical modelling","3 DOF laboratory structure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.574412","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12410/00574412.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"681 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.574412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetorheological dampers: a new approach to seismic protection of structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Magnetorheological dampers: a new approach to seismic protection of structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574412/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5526662","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetorheological dampers: a new approach to seismic protection of structures","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00574412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039849S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"11","articleId":"574412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":574438,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["College of Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Chen","id":"37280668500"},{"name":"Li Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Li Qiu","id":"37279945900"},{"name":"O.

The problem under consideration amounts to determining the minimal tracking error between the output and input signals of a system, attainable by all possible stabilizing compensators. An integral square error criterion is used as a measure for the tracking error, and explicit expressions are derived for this measure with respect to step signals. It is shown that plant nonminimum phase zeros have a negative effect upon a system's ability in reducing the tracking error, and that in a multivariable system this effect results in a way depending upon not only the zero locations, but also the zero directions. It is also shown that plant nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles can together play a particularly detrimental role to tracking performance, especially when the zeros and poles are nearby and their directions are closely aligned. These results lead to new insights into the optimal tracking problem, and more generally, insights into certain fundamental issues concerning limitations on performance achievable via feedback control.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.574438","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12410/00574438.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.574438","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"726","endPage":"731 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations on maximal tracking accuracy.

The MVDR is able to produce more than one adapted beam focused along different DOAs and Doppler frequencies in the radar surveillance volume. The lattice algorithm offers a computational saving; in fact its computational burden is O(N/sup 2/M) in lieu of O(N/sup 2/M/sup 2/). A comprehensive analysis of the numerical robustness of the algorithms is presented when the CORDIC-algorithm is used to compute the QR decomposition (QRD).

This can be achieved through wordlength optimization which trades precision for VLSI measures such as area, speed and power. We present a general search-based methodology for wordlength optimization in VLSI/DSP synthesis. Our methodology is based on statistical precision analysis and incorporation of VLSI measures into an objective function through wordlength parameterization. We use an abstract VLSI model simplified by partitioning the system into basic components and express VLSI measures as functions of wordlengths. This allows us to formulate an optimization problem for VLSI synthesis under finite precision constraints, or to evaluate VLSI costs/performance after the optimization. We show how a general search-based wordlength optimization can produce optimal or near-optimal solutions for different objective-constraint formulations of various applications.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574744","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/4387/12506/00574744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12506","startPage":"198","endPage":"207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search-based wordlength optimization for VLSI/DSP synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Search-based wordlength optimization for VLSI/DSP synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574744/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5105721","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search-based wordlength optimization for VLSI/DSP synthesis","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00574744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030981S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"12506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4387","citationCount":"22","articleId":"574744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":574745,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Our algorithm reads non-skewed input subimages and generates the output in non-skewed form with only a small amount of extra processors. It uses the minimum number of multiplications by employing modified small n algorithms. Our implementation of the 2-D DCT on the Micro Grained Array Processor (MGAP), which is a fine-grained and mesh-connected array processor being developed at the Penn State University, exploits massive parallelism. As a result the 2-D DCT of size 8/spl times/8 and 16/spl times/16 pixels for 256/spl times/256 pixel images can be computed at real time processing rates.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574760","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/4387/12506/00574760.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D discrete cosine transforms on a fine grain array processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574760/","displayDocTitle":"2-D discrete cosine transforms on a fine grain array processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5105737","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D discrete cosine transforms on a fine grain array processor","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00574760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078568S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"12506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4387","citationCount":"4","articleId":"574760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":574761,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The utilization of learning neurons is considerably increased compared to other algorithms. This algorithm not only achieves a near-optimal result, comparable with Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG), but also retains simplicity for hardware implementation.

Wider applicability and improved cost/performance of residue-based VLSI implementations of signal processing algorithms are critically dependent on efficient realization of I/O data conversions and several other support functions that are treated in this paper. Alternate table-lookup schemes for conversion of binary to residue numbers, and vice versa, are presented. Input widths of lookup tables can be changed freely through a repartitioning scheme to provide tradeoffs between table size (area) and computation speed. Improved variants of VLSI-based pipelined binary-to-residue converters are derived along with balanced, highly regular, pipelined architectures for residue-to-binary conversion in VLSI. The input repartitioning method is shown to be applicable to other important residue number system operations, including sign detection, mixed-radix conversion, and base extension.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574771","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/4387/12506/00574771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12506","startPage":"470","endPage":"481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal table lookup schemes for VLSI implementation of input/output conversions and other residue number operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal table lookup schemes for VLSI implementation of input/output conversions and other residue number operations","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574771/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5111885","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal table lookup schemes for VLSI implementation of input/output conversions and other residue number operations","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00574771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034076S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"12506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4387","citationCount":"11","articleId":"574771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":574774,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Gyun Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jin-Gyun Chung","id":"37085920193"},{"name":"K.K.

However, for narrow-band sharp-transition filters, we still have large roundoff noise problems even with second order sections. In this case, the WDF (Wave Digital Filter) can be a good solution. Although the WDFs can be pipelined by the cut-set localization procedure, the maximum sample rate cannot be increased by this technique due to the presence of the feedback loops in the WDFs. In this paper, a pipelined WDF design method for narrow-band sharp transition filters is proposed. The pipelining method is based on the DIFIR (Decomposed and Interpolated FIR) method, where an IIR filter with M-times wider transition bandwidth (compared with the original specification) is cascaded with log/sub 2/ M FIR filters which have very wide transition bandwidths. The new IIR filter produces much smaller noise. In addition, the new IIR transfer function satisfies the pipelining property which can be used in high speed or low power applications.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1994.574774","startPage":"501","endPage":"510","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/4387/12506/00574774.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Wave Digital Filter design for narrow-band sharp-transition digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Wave Digital Filter design for narrow-band sharp-transition digital filters","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5111888","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574774/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Wave Digital Filter design for narrow-band sharp-transition digital filters","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00574774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099813S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"12506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4387","citationCount":"10","articleId":"574774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":574778,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chien Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chien Chiu","id":"37087347704"},{"name":"Po-Tsun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Tsun Liu","id":"37087399719"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3619-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"574778","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Genetic algorithms","Inverse problems","Shape","Tellurium","Electromagnetic scattering","Magnetic fields","Engine cylinders","Boundary conditions","Integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","inverse problems","image reconstruction","integral equations","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","genetic algorithm","conducting cylinder","TE-wave scattering","boundary condition","nonlinear integral equation","object shape"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574778","abstract":"This paper presents a computational approach to reconstruct the shape of a perfectly conducting cylinder illuminated by TE wave.

Retrieval by shape similarity, given a user-sketched template is particularly challenging, owing to the difficulty to derive a similarity measure that closely conforms to the common perception of similarity by humans. In this paper, we present a technique which is based on elastic matching of sketched templates over the shapes in the images to evaluate similarity ranks. The degree of matching achieved and the elastic deformation energy spent by the sketch to achieve such a match are used to derive a measure of similarity between the sketch and the images in the database and to rank images to be displayed. The elastic matching is integrated with arrangements to provide scale invariance and take into account spatial relationships between objects in multi-object queries. Examples from a prototype system are expounded with considerations about the effectiveness of the approach and comparative performance analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/12499/00574790.pdf","doi":"10.1109/34.574790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.574790","startPage":"121","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual image retrieval by elastic matching of user sketches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574790/","displayDocTitle":"Visual image retrieval by elastic matching of user sketches","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5529622","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual image retrieval by elastic matching of user sketches","sourcePdf":"00574790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026623S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"266","articleId":"574790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":574797,"authors":[{"name":"A.

During the imaging procedure, there are several factors which will influence the spatial resolution of the final radiation image: the low pass filtering effect of the antenna pattern, the blurring from the radiometer integrator and the spatial frequency overlap may be caused by sampling. The best resolution could be obtained by compromising between all factors. In general, when a signal with unknown spatial frequency content is to be sampled, a low pass filter must be applied during measurement in order to avoid the overlap of the signal spectrum. From this point of view, the low pass filtering effect of the antenna pattern and the radiometer integrator is beneficial. Additionally the highest spatial frequency that could be restored is the cut-off frequency of the low pass filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5584351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The microwave imaging radiometer sample and integration time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The microwave imaging radiometer sample and integration time","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00574878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024927S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4316","articleId":"574878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":574894,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

In the introduction we address three questions about start-up of hydro power units: what causes the costs in the start-up? How much does a start-up cost? How do start-ups effect the short-term scheduling strategies of power producers in Sweden? In order to answer these questions, we have interviewed employees working with generation planning at the eight largest power producers in Sweden. We found five aspects causing start-up costs: loss of water during maintenance; wear and tear of the windings due to temperature changes during the start-up; wear and tear of mechanical equipment during the start-up; malfunctions in the control equipment during the start-up; and loss of water during the start up. The aspects causing the largest costs are maintenance due to the wear and tear and the unavailability and personnel costs due to malfunctions in the control equipment. The cost of lost water is usually small. Our conclusions are the following: start up cost will depend on the nominal power of the unit and the unit model; the majority of the power producers consider start-ups in their planning; there is a need for better knowledge about start-up cost; and there is a need for planning software which considers start-up costs of hydro units.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5530368","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hydro unit start-up costs and their impact on the short term scheduling strategies of Swedish power producers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydro unit start-up costs and their impact on the short term scheduling strategies of Swedish power producers","sourcePdf":"00574921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044293S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"127","articleId":"574921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":574922,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

On distribution circuits, typically, there are very few available real-time measurements, and thus, researchers have treated customer load demand estimates as pseudo-measurements in a weighted-least-squares formulation. This can lead to convergence problems and also, the approach effectively assumes that all bus load demands are normally distributed (Gaussian) which may not be valid on distribution circuits. This paper presents an alternative approach to distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic extension of the radial load flow algorithm while accounting for real-time measurements as solution constraint. The algorithm which takes advantage of the radial nature of distribution circuits also accounts for other issues specific to distribution circuits. Namely, the algorithm accounts for nonnormally distributed loads, incorporates the concept of load diversity (load correlation) and can interact with a load allocation routine. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated through comparisons made with Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/59.574922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/12421/00574922.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.574922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12421","startPage":"45","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=574922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5530369","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic approach","sourcePdf":"00574922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040786S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"135","articleId":"574922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":574923,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Starting from a power flow solution, the technique first identifies the busses which are reached by power produced by each generator. Then it determines the sets of buses supplied by the same generators. Using proportionality assumption, it is then possible to calculate the contribution of each generator to the loads and flows.

The paper discusses the characteristics of reactive power that must be considered in order to develop a framework for reactive power pricing and management. Several cost allocation methods for valuing reactive power are presented. Two workable reactive power pricing structures are also proposed.

Results of the estimation using the transients at 10 events show that the inertia constant of the 60 Hz power system of Japan is around 14 to 18 seconds in the system load base, and the capacity of the spinning-reserve support generators is 20 to 40% of the system load.

The control problem solution exploits sparsity, combining a system description which preserves a sparse structure with an adequate mathematical formulation of the optimal design approach. The resulting method is thus made applicable to large power systems. Results for two test systems, including a large 750-bus system, are presented.

The purpose of ELD is to determine the power demands of individual generators so that total fuel cost of those generators may be minimized. In evaluating the fuel cost of each generator, an approximate model, which describes the fuel cost as a function of the generation, is used. Therefore, the accuracy of the model has a great influence on the preciseness of the minimization. So far, one of the most prevailing models has been a quadratic model, which describes the fuel cost as a quadratic function of the generation. However, this model often deviates from the actual data, especially during the time while the generation is dynamically varying. This fact implies that, if a model, which is accurate even when the generation dynamically varies, is developed and the model is applied to ELD, the total fuel cost can be reduced. First, taking into account that the deviation might be due to the dynamics of the automatic boiler controller (ABC), we employed as a supplementary model the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, which is capable of describing dynamics and is suitable for an on-line ELD calculation. Second, the ELD problem based on the ARMA-model-supplemented quadratic model is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem, which can be solved by the standard QP method. Finally, the cost reduction effect is evaluated by computer simulations on Kansai Electric Power System.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/574953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5530399","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"On-line economic load dispatch based on fuel cost dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line economic load dispatch based on fuel cost dynamics","sourcePdf":"00574953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036617S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"16","articleId":"574953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":574956,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Histogram modification and adaptive morphological filtering are initially applied to the mammograms to improve the conspicuity of possible microcalcifications. This is followed by a segmentation procedure that uses local image statistics to define possible blocks containing individual microcalcifications. The 2D principal component (PC) transform is used to extract the energy related features of the candidate data blocks. These PCs are then processed using a multi-layer backpropagation neural network to detect the actual microcalcifications. Finally, clusters are formed based upon a preselected proximity criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated on a number of digitized mammograms.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.575236","startPage":"533","endPage":"534 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel3/4363/12495/00575236.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.575236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of clusters of microcalcifications using neural network-based schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Histograms","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Image segmentation","Statistics","Data mining","Personal communication networks","Backpropagation","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","medical image processing","backpropagation","neural nets","image segmentation","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based schemes","microcalcification clusters detection","digitized mammograms","histogram modification","adaptive morphological filtering","possible microcalcifications conspicuity improvement","segmentation procedure","2D principal component transform","energy related features extraction","proximity criterion","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Detection of clusters of microcalcifications using neural network-based schemes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5608669","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of clusters of microcalcifications using neural network-based schemes","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00575236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046216S","chronDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","articleId":"575236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":575283,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

This is problematic for pattern classifiers that fail to incorporate the structure present in the temporal dimension of these signals. Standard feedforward neural network classifiers have difficulty processing temporal signals-time cannot be implicitly represented by the network architecture. A dynamic feedforward neural network architecture is described here that more effectively integrates the temporal information in transient signals, The internal representation of time also allows the dynamic network to classify subsets of the full temporal record. This reduces the time needed to obtain a classification result-an obvious benefit to real-time identification applications, such as the control of prosthetic devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575379/","accessionNumber":"5657276","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic feedforward neural network for subset classification of myoelectric signal patterns","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic feedforward neural network for subset classification of myoelectric signal patterns","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00575379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027537S","chronDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"10","articleId":"575379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":575380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the infant cry is one of the only means that an infant has for communicating with its care-giving environment, it is thought that information regarding the state of an infant, such as hunger or pain, can be determined from cry vocalizations. To date, research groups have determined that a number of different types of cries can be determined auditorily and at least one group has attempted to automate this classification process. This paper presents the results of another attempt at automating the discrimination process, this time using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The input data consists of successive frames of 10 mel-cepstrum coefficients ranging in length from 0.75 seconds to 1 second. The mel-cepstrum coefficients were extracted from anger, fear, and pain cries. The ANNs used were a simple feed-forward network (FF), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a time-delay neural network (TDNN).

In this application, artificial neural networks have achieved reasonable recognition rates. However, to improve performance, a technique is needed to screen the features of the input data, to extract the important ones and suppress those that are irrelevant. Although neural networks do have this capability to some extent, here it is shown that by using a hybrid genetic algorithm and neural network (GANN), the feature extraction can be performed more effectively. Another advantage of augmenting NN training with a GA is that the extracted features using GA are explicit and perceivable. Although the authors evaluated the technique using breast cancer data, the methodology is designed to handle any other kind of classification task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575385/","accessionNumber":"5657282","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction by genetic algorithms for neural networks in breast cancer classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction by genetic algorithms for neural networks in breast cancer classification","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00575385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039648S","chronDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"10","articleId":"575385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":575390,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Small dielectric spheres (radius=1 mm) ranging in relative permittivity from 2 to 100 were individually exposed to a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) plane wave. The spheres' centers were located in the x-y plane, with 0/spl les/x,y/spl les/1 cm. A sensor grid with 25 \"point\" sensors sampled the EMF scattered by each sphere. The EMF data was evaluated at a frequency of 1 MHz, using a dipole approximation. A principal components analysis was applied to the EMF data to derive a feature vector with 4 components, which were input to a feedforward neural network with one 15 unit hidden layer and 3 outputs, for training. The 3 desired outputs were the x and y coordinates of the sphere center and the relative dielectric permittivity of the sphere, respectively. For an independent EMF (testing) data set, the resulting, root mean-square (RMS) errors were quite small, being 0.03 mm, 0.05 mm, and 1, for the x- and y-sphere center and sphere permittivity estimates, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the neural networks may be useful in the solution of inverse scattering problems.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.575390","startPage":"841","endPage":"842 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel3/4363/12495/00575390.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.575390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic inverse scattering using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","Inverse problems","Neural networks","Permittivity","Dielectrics","Computer simulation","Application software","Frequency","Principal component analysis","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","inverse problems","feedforward neural nets","permittivity","learning (artificial intelligence)","electrical engineering computing","physics computing","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic inverse scattering","computer simulation","neural networks","small dielectric spheres","relative permittivity","transverse electromagnetic plane wave","sensor grid","point sensors","dipole approximation","principal components analysis","feature vector","feedforward neural network","hidden layer","training","sphere center coordinates","root mean-square errors","1 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic inverse scattering using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5657287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic inverse scattering using neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00575390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05374S","chronDate":"20-25 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"1","articleId":"575390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":575420,"authors":[{"name":"Leung Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Leung Tsang","id":"37087144572"},{"name":"Zhengxiao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhengxiao Chen","id":"37087588597"},{"name":"Seho Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Seho Oh","id":"37087630421"},{"name":"R.J.

Thermogravitational analyses on these solder pastes were performed to explain the observed phenomena. It is found that the solder paste with lower viscosity range has a larger evaporation rate of organics than those with higher viscosity range before metal alloys melting, but a smaller rate after metal alloys melting.

The introduction of ultrasonic energy into the flip-chip bonding process increases the speed of the assembly process while at the same time lowering the physical stresses (temperature and assembly force) applied to bond the components. Many empirical studies have shown that T/S flip-chip bonding is feasible, but there is a lack of detailed understanding of the effects of the ultrasonic energy on the bonding results. We are conducting experiments and developing models that will provide a sound understanding and a rational basis for T/S flip-chip bonding. In particular, we have addressed the problems of the impact of joint bump size, control of the assembly force, and the repeatability of the ultrasonic power. This report details our findings concerning the following aspects important to the development of T/S flip-chip bonding technology: (1) Computer modeling to guide the selection of design parameters and provide a basis to study the effects of the interaction of the critical design and process parameters on process yield. (2) Design of a new end effector for accurately applying and monitoring small assembly force. (3) Monitoring and controlling the impedance of the ultrasonic mechanical and electrical system in order to insure repeatable delivery of acoustic energy to the assembly.","doi":"10.1109/96.575567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.575567","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/12470/00575567.pdf","startPage":"152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermosonic bonding of an optical transceiver based on an 8/spl times/8 vertical cavity surface emitting laser array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575567/","displayDocTitle":"Thermosonic bonding of an optical transceiver based on an 8/spl times/8 vertical cavity surface emitting laser array","volume":"20","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5578727","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermosonic bonding of an optical transceiver based on an 8/spl times/8 vertical cavity surface emitting laser array","sourcePdf":"00575567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05686S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"41","articleId":"575567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":575569,"authors":[{"name":"Soon-Jin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soon-Jin Cho","id":"37087253562"},{"name":"Kyung-Wook Paik","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung-Wook Paik","id":"37087065370"},{"name":"Young-Gil Kim","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Gil Kim","id":"37087249397"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9894"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3686"}],"articleNumber":"575569","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":920},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology Society","url":"http://www.cpmt.org/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575569","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oxidation","Adhesives","Copper","Electromagnetic compatibility","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Packaging","Surface topography","Lead compounds","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesion","oxidation","copper","packaging","X-ray photoelectron spectra","Auger effect","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oxide layer structure","copper-base leadframe","interface adhesion","epoxy molding compound","low temperature oxidation","pull strength","surface wettability","mechanical interlocking","X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Auger electron spectroscopy","failure mode","copper metal","Cu"]}],"abstract":"Low temperature oxidation of a Cu-base leadframe has been made to investigate the effect of Cu oxidation on the adhesion of Cu-base leadframe (Cu L/F) to epoxy molding compounds (EMC). In contrast to previous studies, the existence of small amount of cupric oxide (CuO) was observed next to the Cu/sub 2/O, confirming the oxide layer structure of Cu/Cu/sub 2/O/CuO/air. It was shown that the early stage of oxidation improved the adhesion strength between EMC and Cu leadframe. Furthermore the optimum copper oxide thickness required for the maximum pull strength ranged from 20 nm to 30 nm. The high pull strength was presumably due to the increase of surface wettability and mechanical interlocking effects resulting from oxidation. The Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies on the Cu L/F and EMC surface after pull test indicated that failure modes before the maximum adhesion were a mixture of the adhesive failure between Cu/sub 2/O and CuO interface plus the EMC cohesive failure.

When the coupling phase is chosen properly (depending on the oscillator model), the near-carrier phase noise is reduced to 1/N that of a single oscillator, provided the coupling network is reciprocal. This is proved In general, and illustrated with specific cases of globally coupled and nearest-neighbor coupled oscillator chains. A slight noise degradation is found for unilaterally coupled (nonreciprocal) chains. The 1/N reduction for reciprocal coupling applies over nearly the entire range of free-running frequency distributions required for beam-scanning, and is verified experimentally using a linear chain of coupled GaAs MESFET voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) operating at X-band. The effect of a nonoptimum coupling phase on the phase noise of the system is also studied. As the coupling phase deviates from the optimum value, the phase noise increases significantly near the locking range edge for noise offset frequency near the carrier.","doi":"10.1109/22.575575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/12473/00575575.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.575575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase noise in coupled oscillators: theory and experiment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575575/","displayDocTitle":"Phase noise in coupled oscillators: theory and experiment","volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587775","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase noise in coupled oscillators: theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00575575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067337S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"194","articleId":"575575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":575581,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The modeling techniques were found to predict the measured conversion loss to within 1 dB.

The proposed approach enhances the ability to utilize electromagnetic (EM) analysis techniques in an interactive CAD environment through the application of neurocomputing technology. Specifically, a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is implemented to model monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) passive elements using the element's physical parameters. The strength of this approach is that only a minimum number of EM simulations of these passive elements are required to capture critical input-output relationships. The technique used to describe the data set required for model development is based on a statistical design of experiment (DoE) approach. Data generated from EM simulations are used to train the MLPNN which, once trained, is capable of modeling passive elements not included in the training set. The results presented indicate that the MLPNN can predict the s-parameters of these passive elements to nearly the same degree of accuracy as that afforded by EM simulation. The correlations between the MLPNN-computed and EM-simulated results are greater than 0.98 for each modeled parameter.","doi":"10.1109/22.575602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/12474/00575602.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.575602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12474","startPage":"794","endPage":"802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for fast and accurate EM-CAD of microwave circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for fast and accurate EM-CAD of microwave circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587783","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for fast and accurate EM-CAD of microwave circuits","sourcePdf":"00575602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033591S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"98","articleId":"575602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":575603,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Bae Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hong-Bae Lee","id":"37615943300"},{"name":"T.

A waveguide-to-microstrip (W/G-to-M/S) probe-type transition is designed by using the proposed method. In the FEM as a full-wave analyzer, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations in the two-dimensional (2-D) FEM precede the three-dimensional (3-D) FEM, in order to terminate the W/G-to-MIS transition model into an electrically small model. The analysis results of this approach are compared with ones of a commercial FEM software high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS). The total derivative required in the steepest descent algorithm is calculated numerically by the DSA based on the FEM. The additional time needed for this proposed method is only one more calculation of a sparse matrix equation. The return loss is chosen as the objective function to be minimized, and the backshort length and probe length are selected as the design variables in the transition design.

The method analyzes a finite-element model of a filter by first computing the eigenmodes of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure. The computed eigenvalues are shown to reliably determine all of the resonant frequencies in a frequency range; the filter design can be changed until the desired resonant frequencies are computed. Finally, the eigenvectors are used as basis functions to compute the frequency response of the filter, thereby achieving a speedup that increases with the number of frequencies analyzed. Two filters analyzed in this paper show speedups ranging from 1.39 to 4.01, and their computed S-parameters agree closely with measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/12474/00575605.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.575605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.575605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave filter analysis using a new 3-D finite-element modal frequency method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave filters","Finite element methods","Resonator filters","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Resonant frequency","Frequency response","Resonance","Equations","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","microwave filters","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","frequency response","S-parameters","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D finite-element modal frequency method","microwave filter analysis","eigenmodes","resonant frequencies","filter design","basis functions","frequency response","S-parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Microwave filter analysis using a new 3-D finite-element modal frequency method","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587785","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave filter analysis using a new 3-D finite-element modal frequency method","sourcePdf":"00575605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069374S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","articleId":"575605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":575606,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Nan Kuo","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chien-Nan Kuo","id":"37292173500"},{"name":"B.

As a consequence, analysis of linear and nonlinear properties, including harmonic generation and intermodulation, can be accomplished by employing a large-signal device circuit model. The implementation is first validated by comparing results of FDTD and HP MDS simulation of the circuit without the packaging structure.

The given information can either be theoretical datapoints or measured experimental data over a band. For theoretical data extrapolation or interpolation, the sampled values of the function and, optionally, a few of its derivatives have been used to reconstruct the function. For measured data, only measured values of the parameter are used to create broadband information from limited data as derivative information is too noisy. Cauchy's method assumes that the parameter to be extrapolated/interpolated, as a function of frequency, is a ratio of two polynomials. The problem is to determine the order of the polynomials and the coefficients therein. The method of total least squares (TLS) has been used to solve the resulting matrix equation involving the coefficients of the polynomials. Typical numerical results have been presented to show that reliable interpolation/extrapolation can be done for various system responses.","doi":"10.1109/22.575608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.575608","startPage":"837","endPage":"845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/12474/00575608.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Cauchy method for extrapolating/interpolating narrowband system responses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Cauchy method for extrapolating/interpolating narrowband system responses","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5587788","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575608/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Cauchy method for extrapolating/interpolating narrowband system responses","sourcePdf":"00575608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037973S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"138","articleId":"575608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":575616,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

The shape of the conductivity in the PML layers has to be chosen carefully to obtain the best performance for a given number of layers. The relative error is shown to be the composite of two distinct effects: the theoretical reflection coefficient given by the PML layers backed by a metal plane and the second-order error in the differential intrinsic in the FDTD formulation. A theoretical expression to evaluate this error as a function of the number of PML layers and the shape of the conductivity is given, and the result is compared to that obtained for several FDTD test cases. The good agreement of the shapes of the theoretical and numerically derived curves allows the use of the theoretical formulation to optimize the PML region as a function of the shape of the conductivity, resolution, and number of layers.","doi":"10.1109/8.575651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12451/00575651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.575651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12451","startPage":"914","endPage":"917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimal design of the PML absorbing boundary condition for the FDTD code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the optimal design of the PML absorbing boundary condition for the FDTD code","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5580364","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimal design of the PML absorbing boundary condition for the FDTD code","sourcePdf":"00575651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02655S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","articleId":"575651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":575658,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The interaction exists for two reasons. First, the arc resistance is highly dependent upon the power density. Second, the output power of the resonant converter is a strong function of the load resistance. Soft switching, essential to the efficient and reliable functioning of the power converter, complicates the design process. This paper presents a robust design methodology, via nonlinear programming (NP), where the transition interval and midpoint capacitance are critical elements of the solution. Analytical expressions are offered as ingredients of the parameter optimization. Minimizing the RMS current flow through the active switches yields peak efficiency. In this case, the converter operates with zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS), with nonzero values of midpoint capacitance. Excellent agreement between the analytical and physical models was achieved. The efficiency of the physical model was found to exceed 90%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.575678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/12472/00575678.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"516","doi":"10.1109/63.575678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a 2.5-MHz, soft-switching, class-D converter for electrodeless lighting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Design of a 2.5-MHz, soft-switching, class-D converter for electrodeless lighting","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5581236","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575678/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a 2.5-MHz, soft-switching, class-D converter for electrodeless lighting","sourcePdf":"00575678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027258S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"43","articleId":"575678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":575680,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is mathematically proven that the increase of electromagnetic torque in a permanent magnet motor is proportional to the increase of the angle between the stator and rotor flux linkages, and, therefore, the fast torque response can be obtained by adjusting the rotating speed of the stator flux linkage as fast as possible. It is also shown that the zero voltage vectors should not be used, and stator flux linkage should be kept moving with respect to the rotor flux linkage all the time. The implementation of DTC in the permanent magnet motor is discussed, and it is found that for DTC using available digital signal processors (DSPs), it is advantageous to have a motor with a high ratio of the rated stator flux linkage to stator voltage. The simulation results verify the proposed control and also show that the torque response under DTC is much faster than the one under current control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/12472/00575680.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.575680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.575680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of direct torque control in permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Torque control","Permanent magnets","Stators","Couplings","Permanent magnet motors","Rotors","Voltage","Digital signal processors","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","machine control","torque control","stators","digital signal processing chips","machine theory","magnetic flux","rotors","digital control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct torque control","permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","electromagnetic torque","rotor flux linkage","stator flux linkage","digital signal processors","DSP","stator voltage","saliency","sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of direct torque control in permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5581238","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of direct torque control in permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","sourcePdf":"00575680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031855S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"646","articleId":"575680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":575681,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Sun","id":"37087142990"},{"name":"H.

When N=2, the exact interpolation formula can be derived quite easily. The ideal interpolation filters have infinite impulse responses (IIRs). This paper addresses first the question of recovering from the two initial sequences any other sequence taken at the same rate 1/T and with a different sampling phase. The design problem is dealt with for finite length filters, and the criterion is the minimization of the mean squared interpolation error. Next, the problem of computing from the two initial sequences a third one at a lower rate is addressed. FIR decimation filters are also designed for an MMSE criterion. These problems are illustrated for two typical covariance functions.","doi":"10.1109/78.575689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.575689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12452","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12452/00575689.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Interpolation","Sampling methods","Bandwidth","IIR filters","Nonuniform sampling","Image sampling","Image reconstruction","Signal sampling","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","filtering theory","interpolation","signal sampling","sequences","covariance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downsampling FIR filters","periodic nonuniform sampling","interpolation FIR filters","MMSE design","generalized sampling theorem","analog signal","sampling phase","infinite impulse response","sequence recovery","finite length filters","mean squared interpolation error minimization","initial sequences","FIR decimation filters","covariance functions","AR Markov process","correlation factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MMSE design of interpolation and downsampling FIR filters in the context of periodic nonuniform sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575689/","volume":"45","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5582243","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE design of interpolation and downsampling FIR filters in the context of periodic nonuniform sampling","sourcePdf":"00575689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045393S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","articleId":"575689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":575690,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

It is shown that the DFT naturally encodes the frequency information of a signal in a format that is in the same form as the SNS. Consequently, aliases that result from undersampling a signal can be resolved exactly using r/spl ges/2 channels. To demonstrate the concept, two- and three-channel examples are presented.

The cluster-based MLSE can be used for digital communication through nonlinear finite-length channels because channel mapping estimation is used instead of channel estimation in the conventional MLSE. The clustering network of the cluster-based MLSE, which estimates the channel mapping between the signal input vectors and the noiseless channel outputs, is a supervised network and requires a training sequence. We propose a blind channel mapping estimator to estimate the channel mapping without using the training sequence. The blind channel mapping estimator has a clustering block and a mapping block. The clustering block estimates the channel outputs, which represent the channel mapping, subject to an unknown permutation operation because no training sequence is utilized. That permutation operation is resolved by the mapping block, and therefore, the channel mapping is obtained. Introducing the blind channel mapping estimator into the cluster-based MLSE, a blind cluster-based MLSE for nonlinear channels can be done.

These architectures have been derived via the application of algebraic and algorithm transformations. The strength reduction transformation is applied at the algorithmic level as opposed to the traditional application at the architectural level. This results in a power reduction by 21% as compared with the traditional cross-coupled structure. A fine-grained pipelined architecture for the strength-reduced algorithm is then developed via the relaxed lookahead transformation. This technique, which is an approximation of the conventional lookahead computation, maintains the functionality of the algorithm rather than the input-output behavior. Convergence analysis of the proposed architecture is presented and supported via simulation results. The pipelined architecture allows high-speed operation with negligible hardware overhead. It also enables an additional power savings of 39 to 69% when combined with power-supply reduction. Thus, an overall power reduction ranging from 60-90% over the traditional cross-coupled architecture is achieved. The proposed architecture is then employed as a receive equalizer in a communication system for a data rate of 51.84 Mb/s over 100 m of UTP-3 wiring in an ATM-LAN environment.

The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is characterized by a nonuniform data dependence structure owing to the decimation operation it is neither a uniform recurrence equation (URE) nor an affine recurrence equation (ARE) and consequently cannot be transformed directly using linear space-time mapping methods into efficient array architectures. Our approach is to apply first appropriate nonlinear transformations operating on the algorithm's index space, leading to a new DWT formulation on which application of linear space-time mapping can become effective. The first transformation of the algorithm achieves regularization of interoctave dependencies but alone does not lead to efficient array solutions after the mapping due to limitations associated with transforming the three-dimensional (3-D) algorithm onto one-dimensional (1-D) arrays, which is also known as multiprojection. The second transformation is introduced to remove the need for multiprojection by formulating the regularized DWT algorithm in a two-dimensional (2-D) index space. Using this DWT formulation, we have synthesized two VLSI-amenable linear arrays of LPEs computing a 6-octave DWT decomposition with latencies of M and 2M-1, respectively, where L is the wavelet filter length, and M is the number of samples in the data sequence. The arrays are modular, regular, use simple control, and can be easily extended to larger L and J. The latency of both arrays is independent of the highest octave J, and the efficiency is nearly 100% for any M with one design achieving the lowest possible latency of M.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform: data dependence analysis and synthesis of distributed memory and control array architectures","doi":"10.1109/78.575701","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.575701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12452/00575701.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform: data dependence analysis and synthesis of distributed memory and control array architectures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5589879","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform: data dependence analysis and synthesis of distributed memory and control array architectures","sourcePdf":"00575701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033869S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"575701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":575704,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The bandwidth efficiency and power spectral density figures of merit for the general signal are derived and shown to be that of standard QAM.","doi":"10.1109/78.575704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/12452/00575704.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.575704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet packet modulation for orthogonally multiplexed communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575704/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet packet modulation for orthogonally multiplexed communication","volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5582257","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet packet modulation for orthogonally multiplexed communication","sourcePdf":"00575704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042848S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"126","articleId":"575704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":575706,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The proposed test is simple to implement and uses the already available matrices and data structures of the commonly used weighted least squares state estimation programs. It can be utilized as a planning tool during the initial stages of measurement system design as well as an online observability analysis tool to enhance the capability of the existing observability programs which can not properly process the current magnitude measurements.

The first technique is the estimation algorithm of the rotor initial position including the identification of the rotor magnet N-S polarity at standstill. IPMSM possess the saliency which produces the ellipse of the stator current when the high frequency voltage is injected to the motor terminal. The major axis angle of the current ellipse gives rotor position information at standstill. The center of the current ellipse shifts because of the magnetic saturation effect from the origin, which makes it possible to identify the rotor magnet N-S polarity. The averaging method of the multi-cycles stator current is utilized to identify the rotor magnet N-S polarity. This averaging method increases the accuracy of the position estimation and solves the current ripple problem. The second control technique is a sensorless control algorithm that injects the high frequency current to the stator terminal in order to estimate the rotor position and speed. The rotor position and speed for sensorless vector control is achieved by appropriate signal processing to extract the position information from the stator current even in the low speed range. Experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed control schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor without a shaft sensor","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1997.575726","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4379/12494/00575726.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"748 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1997.575726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=575726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Vector control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor without a shaft sensor","conferenceDate":"27-27 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5595812","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor without a shaft sensor","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00575726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03335S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379","citationCount":"7","articleId":"575726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":575729,"authors":[{"name":"H.

More strictly, the obtainable points by the method are the stationary points including not only CLL but also farthest and saddle points. An operating solution and a low voltage load flow solution are used to efficiently estimate the node injections at a CLL as well as the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the load flow Jacobian. They can be used in monitoring loadability margin, in identification of weak spots in a power system and in the examination of an optimal control against voltage collapse. Most of the computation time of the proposed method is taken in calculating the load flow solution pair. The remaining computation time is less than that of an ordinary load flow.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5530414","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A method to approximate a closest loadability limit using multiple load flow solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method to approximate a closest loadability limit using multiple load flow solutions","sourcePdf":"00575754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05181S","chronDate":"Feb.  1997","isNumber":"12421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"48","articleId":"575754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":575768,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Stability criteria based on the Nyquist criterion are developed for both approaches.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1997.575779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1997.575779","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1056 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4379/12494/00575779.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative incremental impedance and stability of fluorescent lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Negative incremental impedance and stability of fluorescent lamps","conferenceDate":"27-27 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5591518","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/575779/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative incremental impedance and stability of fluorescent lamps","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00575779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043636S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379","citationCount":"116","articleId":"575779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":575787,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The array parameters can then be estimated by maximum likelihood, least-squares, or some other algorithm.

The availability of this information proves the key to achieving yield and performance goals in deep submicron designs. The novel process involves predicting, at an early stage in logic design, the probable paths of interconnects and any problems likely to ensue. Later on, it tackles device layout and performance verification one small step at a time. To do this, the front-end logic designers need tools to gather the proper information without plunging into the intricacies of physical design, while the back-end physical designers need tools with which to surmount interconnect issues.

The simplex method for optimization is not nearly as effectual, and neither are the various statistical methods for classifying and associating data and predicting results. The reason is that neural networks are put through a training phase, during which they can automatically fine-tune themselves as often as proves necessary to get the desired performance. Of course, the old adage \"garbage in...garbage out\" applies as much to neural networks as it does to all other data-processing applications. If the training data set (the collection of input data and its associated correct output data) is not thoughtfully chosen, the resulting network is unlikely to hold up well in an industrial environment. So it is hardly surprising that massaging the set of training data consumes some 80 percent of the engineering time spent getting a real-world neural network up and running-that is, getting it to converge under a broad enough range of conditions to be deployed with confidence in a production situation. If that data preparation is done systematically, much time can be saved and a more robust end-product can be obtained. A nine-step process is given that experience (the author's) has shown can enhance the probability of obtaining a learning convergence robust enough for industrial use.","doi":"10.1109/6.576011","pdfPath":"/iel3/6/12503/00576011.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.576011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preparng the right data diet for training neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","displayDocTitle":"Preparng the right data diet for training neural networks","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5529523","publicationDate":"March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preparng the right data diet for training neural networks","sourcePdf":"00576011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031885S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"5","articleId":"576011","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":576227,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

This is an extension of work on active shape models (ASMs)-statistical models which iteratively deform to match image data. An ASM consists of a shape model controlling a set of landmark points, together with a statistical model of the grey-levels expected around each landmark. Both the shape model and the grey-level models are trained on sets of labelled example images. In order to apply a coarse-to-fine search strategy it is necessary to train a set of grey-level models for each landmark, one for every level of a multiresolution image pyramid. We demonstrate the approach and give results of quantitative experiments which show a significant increase in both speed, robustness and quality of fit compared to previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.576375","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 12th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 12th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/4391/12513/00576375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1994.576375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12513","startPage":"610","endPage":"612 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-resolution search with active shape models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=576375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-resolution search with active shape models","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576375/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985737","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-resolution search with active shape models","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00576375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027152S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct 1994","isNumber":"12513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4391","citationCount":"32","articleId":"576375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":576394,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Three receivers (a conventional single-user coherent receiver, an approximated maximum likelihood receiver with multi-user detection, and a \"decorrelating receiver\") for a diversity coded system are compared and their performance versus CCI is reported. Multi-user and decorrelation detection provide a means to approach CDMA performance by TDMA. A fundamental limitation of conventional receivers is that their decision metric does not take into account the statistics of the interfering signals, which are treated like noise. We show how some concepts developed in the context of multi-user communications were put to work in the design of receivers for coded transmission over narrowband fading channels with diversity. Our analysis focuses on the Rayleigh channel, but we also provide simulation results for the land mobile satellite channel.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960399","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4395/12516/00576491.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19960399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System capacity enhancement by using multi-user processing techniques in narrowband satellite mobile communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"System capacity enhancement by using multi-user processing techniques in narrowband satellite mobile communications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5329800","publicationDate":"1996","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System capacity enhancement by using multi-user processing techniques in narrowband satellite mobile communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00576491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032166S","chronDate":"13-15 May 1996","isNumber":"12516","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4395","citationCount":"1","articleId":"576491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":576508,"authors":[{"name":"M.A.N.

These effects vary with respect to the elevation angle of the satellite to the user. In the past decade, many propagation studies by various organisations, have addressed the effects of signal attenuation with respect to elevation angle and user environment. However, there is very little data on the effects of wideband parameters with respect to elevation angle. These can be very important in characterising the channel for hand-held terminals in future satellite PCN systems. A wideband propagation study applicable to satellite-based mobile vehicle mounted and hand held communication systems at L- and S-bands has been carried out by the CSER at the University of Surrey around the Guildford area. Simultaneous measurements were carried out during the summer months of 1995 at L-band (1540-1560 MHz) and S-band (2315-2335 MHz). The frequencies allocated by the Radiocommunications Agency being as close as possible to the bands that have been allocated for mobile satellite communications, without causing interference to other users, given the bandwidth required (20 MHz), for the channel sounder. The transmissions were radiated from a helicopter acting as an alternative platform simulating a satellite. A Robinson R22 helicopter and a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter was used during the measurement campaign.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband propagation measurements and results at L- and S-bands for personal and mobile satellite communications","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960410","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4395/12516/00576508.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19960410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=576508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Wideband propagation measurements and results at L- and S-bands for personal and mobile satellite communications","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329811","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband propagation measurements and results at L- and S-bands for personal and mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00576508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041953S","chronDate":"13-15 May 1996","isNumber":"12516","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4395","citationCount":"2","articleId":"576508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":576519,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The proposed S-PCNs are Iridium, Inmarsat-P, Globalstar, Odyssey and Ellipse. The first two systems propose to use a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and the others code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme. It is claimed that CDMA based S-PCNs can share the allocated frequency bands due to the interference resistant property of CDMA. Spectrum sharing must be based on defined interference criteria being satisfied. The interference events are based on the statistics of the C/I. For this a computer simulation was developed to model the dynamic nature of any constellation, and produces all the statistical values of the C/I to a mobile in a fading channel. The simulation includes constellations the results of proposed S-PCNs with multi-spotbeam antennas (MBA). We present the results of the investigation on the effect of totally overlapped band sharing on the bandwidth utilisation and resultant capacity and compare this capacity with that of a band segmentation approach. Computed values of the C/I in totally overlapped band sharing and segmented band sharing scenarios are translated into the system capacity. The results lead to specific criteria which must be satisfied for band sharing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4395/12516/00576519.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1996.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19960417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=576519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nongeostationary satellite-PCN","CDMA","segmented band sharing","global telephony services","Iridium","Inmarsat-P","Globalstar","Odyssey","Ellipse","time division multiple access","TDMA","code division multiple access","frequency allocation","interference resistant property","system capacity","carrier to interference ratio statistics","computer simulation","fading channel","multispotbeam antennas","bandwidth utilisation","overlapped band sharing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5329818","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Band sharing between CDMA based non-geostationary satellite-PCNs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00576519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039311S","chronDate":"13-15 May 1996","isNumber":"12516","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4395","citationCount":"1","articleId":"576519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":576626,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Much has been said about scene independence of different acceleration techniques and the alleged superiority of one approach over another. Several theoretical and practical studies conducted in the past have led to the same conclusion: a space partitioning method that allows the fastest rendering of one scene often fails with another. Specialization may be the answer. This has always been pursued, consciously or not, in developing various ray-tracing systems. Despite our new algorithm's impressive efficiency, we don't interpret the new method as the fastest ray-tracing scene decomposition possible. This is because our recent groundwork experiments with a derivative method produced in some of the test scenes presented in this article produced timings that were better by approximately 50%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/12509/00576857.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/38.576857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.576857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=576857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster ray tracing using adaptive grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Layout","Clustering algorithms","Vehicles","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","rendering (computer graphics)","interpolation","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","adaptive grids","hybrid approach","irregular object distributions","area interpolator","scene independence","acceleration techniques","space partitioning method","rendering","specialization","algorithm efficiency","scene decomposition","timings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1997","displayDocTitle":"Faster ray tracing using adaptive grids","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1997","accessionNumber":"5479542","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster ray tracing using adaptive grids","sourcePdf":"00576857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040524S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1997","isNumber":"12509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"39","articleId":"576857","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":576870,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The purpose of the project is to propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.576870","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 3 - Conference C: Signal Processing (Cat.

The system goes from raw, binary scanned images of census forms to ASCII transcriptions of the fields contained within the forms. The first step is to locate and extract the handwritten input from the forms. Then, a large number of character subimages are extracted and individual classified using a MLP (multilayer perceptron). A Viterbi-like algorithm is used to assemble the individual classified character subimages into optimal interpretations of an input string, taking into account both the quality of the overall segmentation and the degree to which each character subimage of the segmentation matches a character model. The system uses two different statistical language models, one based on a phrase dictionary and the other based on a simple word grammar. Hypotheses from recognition based on each language model are integrated using a decision tree classifier. Results from the application of the system to the recognition of handwritten responses on US census forms are reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.576889","startPage":"129","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 3 - Conference C: Signal Processing (Cat.

Images digitized by flatbed scanner are subjected to skew correction, line, word and character segmentation, simple and compound character separation, feature extraction and finally character recognition. A feature based tree classifier is used for simple character recognition. Preprocessing like thinning and skeletonization is not necessary in our scheme and hence the system is quite fast. At present, the system has an accuracy of about 96%. Also, some character occurrence statistics have been computed to model an error detection and correction technique in the near future.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 3 - Conference C: Signal Processing (Cat.

To output a high resolution document on a low resolution device, it may be necessary to introduce downsampling. Standard signal processing techniques such as linear filtering and decimation don't work very well at low resolutions. Better results are obtained by a nonlinear filtering technique we introduce in this paper, called nonlinear document equalization. Even better results are obtained by taking advantage of fonts designed specifically for bitmap terminals and other low resolution devices. However, character-level information is required to make use of fonts. This information is not always available; OCR is not 100% accurate. We propose a hybrid approach: downsample by font substitution when possible, and decimate when necessary. Unfortunately, the result tends to look like a \"ransom note\". Equalization is used to blend the two cases together so that gaps in the OCR analysis become almost unnoticeable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/576925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4986126","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using OCR and equalization to downsample documents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using OCR and equalization to downsample documents","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00576925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033222S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct 1994","isNumber":"12512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428","citationCount":"1","articleId":"576925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":576941,"authors":[{"name":"I.

However, most recent models of vision based on OFR have demonstrated the ability of invariant recognition of only simple objects like letters or binary objects without background, i.e. objects to which a frame of reference is easily attached. In contrast, the authors have based their model not on OFR, but on scanpath theory and on a feature-based frame of reference (FFR), connected with the basic feature (edge) at each fixation point. This has allowed the authors to consider some behavior aspects of vision and has provided for their model the ability for invariant representation and recognition of complex objects in gray-level images.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.576941","startPage":"371","endPage":"373 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 3 - Conference C: Signal Processing (Cat.

A new trend to tackle this task by the use of multiple classifiers has emerged, which is called \"combination of multiple classifiers\" (CME). In this paper, a novel approach for CME is developed and discussed in detail. It contains two steps: data transformation and data classification. In data transformation, the output values of each classifier are first transformed into a form of likeness measurement. In data classification, neural-networks have been found very suitable to aggregate the transformed output and produce the final classification decisions. Experiments on 46,451 handwritten numerals have shown a great improvement in recognition by using the present method.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.576986","pdfPath":"/iel2/4428/12512/00576986.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"475 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 3 - Conference C: Signal Processing (Cat.

A distributed algorithm for implementing such power control was proposed earlier for satellite systems by Meyerhoff (1974). The authors tighten the mathematical arguments and apply this scheme to cellular systems. The mobile units adjust their transmitter powers at discrete time instants. Specifically at each time instant the mobile multiplies its current power by a factor equal to a constant over its current carrier to interference ratio (CIR). So power is increased or decreased based on the value of the current CIR. After a number of such power adjustments all the mobiles converge to a common CIR. They also present numerical results which show that the above scheme has the potential to converge faster than the scheme proposed by J. Zander (see IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol.41, no.3, August 1992) for high CIR values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577019.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power control in cellular radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577019/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control in cellular radio systems","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","accessionNumber":"4684348","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control in cellular radio systems","sourcePdf":"00577019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025927S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"195","articleId":"577019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577023,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In the transmitter, the outputs of the component codes are bit interleaved prior to mapping into 8-PSK channel signals. A multistage receiver is considered, in which the output amplitudes of the Gaussian channel are soft limited before entering the second and third stage decoders. Upper bounds and Gaussian approximations for the bit error probability of every component code, which take into account errors in previously decoded stages, are presented. Aided by a comprehensive computer simulation, it is demonstrated in a specific example that the addition of the interleaver and soft limiter in the third stage improves its performance by 1.1 dB at a bit error probability of 10/sup /spl minus/5/, and that the multilevel scheme improves on an Ungerboeck's code with the same decoding complexity. The rate selection of the component codes is also considered and a simple selection rule, based on information theoretic arguments, is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684362","volume":"42","issue":"234","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a multilevel coded modulation system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a multilevel coded modulation system","sourcePdf":"00577036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113143S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"52","articleId":"577036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577040,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The authors present two such algorithms, (i) a parallel LVA that simultaneously produces the L best candidates and (ii) a serial LVA that iteratively produces the k/sup th/ best candidate based on knowledge of the previously found k-1 best paths. The application of LVA to a concatenated communication system consisting of an inner convolutional code and an outer error detecting code is considered in detail. Analysis as well as simulation results show that significant improvement in error performance is obtained when the inner decoder, which is conventionally based on the Viterbi algorithm (VA), is replaced by the LVA. An improvement of up to 3 dB is obtained for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel due to an increase in the minimum Euclidean distance. Ever larger gains are obtained for the Rayleigh fading channel due to an increase in the time diversity. It is also shown that a 10% improvement in throughput is obtained along with significantly reduced probability of a decoding failure for a hybrid FEC/ARQ scheme with the inner code being a rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577040.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"List Viterbi decoding algorithms with applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"List Viterbi decoding algorithms with applications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684363","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List Viterbi decoding algorithms with applications","sourcePdf":"00577040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085352S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"239","articleId":"577040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":577044,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A number of digital schemes have been proposed in the past as an alternative. To overcome the effects of Rayleigh fades that appear in the received speech as noise bursts in the form of \"pops\" and \"clicks\", the author proposes packetizing speech and encoding the packets in an error-detecting code before transmitting them. If the receiver detects an error, it throws away the packet and requests the transmitter to retransmit the same packet. If the requested packet has not arrived in a given time period, the missed packets are replaced with zero amplitude values. The variable delays that packets are subjected to as a result of this procedure are smoothed out before packets are played back so that they all appear contiguous at the receiving end. The resulting improvement in the SNR at the receiving end depends, among other things, on the maximum delay and the vehicle speed, and is achieved in addition to any improvement that is possible with a specially designed coder. For example, with 4 ms long packets and 12 ms of delay, the SNR improves by about 13 dB at a vehicle speed of 35 mph and 17 dB at 12 mph.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Speech coding","Speech enhancement","Bit rate","Delay","Vehicles","Encoding","Radio transmitters","Frequency modulation","Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","packet radio networks","digital radio systems","error detection codes","voice communication","fading","radiotelephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packetizing voice","mobile radio systems","noise bursts","Rayleigh fades","packet speech","encoding","error-detecting code","delays","SNR","vehicle speed","cellular radio"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577064","startPage":"377","endPage":"385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577064.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packetizing voice for mobile radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Packetizing voice for mobile radio","accessionNumber":"4684370","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","volume":"42","issue":"234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packetizing voice for mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00577064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055822S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","articleId":"577064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":577065,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The compander, included in the PCM telephone network to improve voice performance, has an unusual affect on digital QAM data signals which are transmitted over the same channel. The quantization noise, generated by the companding process which is multiplicative (and asymmetric), degrades the detectability performance of the outermost points of the QAM constellation more than that of the inner points. The combined effect of the companding noise and the inherent white Gaussian noise of the system, leads to a re-examination of signal constellation design. The authors investigate the detectability performance of a number of candidates for signal constellations including, a typical rectangular QAM constellation, the same constellation with the addition of a smear-desmear operation, and two new improved QAM constellation designs with two-dimensional warping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577069.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM transmission through a companding channel/spl minus/signal constellations and detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Gaussian noise","Signal design","Signal processing","Phase change materials","Telephony","Quantization","Noise generators","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","signal processing","signal detection","digital signals","telephone networks","analogue-digital conversion","white noise","random noise","pulse-code modulation links","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM transmission","companding channel","signal constellations","signal detection","QAM signals","PCM telephone network","voice performance","digital QAM data signals","quantization noise","multiplicative noise","QAM constellation","companding noise","white Gaussian noise","signal constellation design","detectability performance","rectangular QAM constellation","smear-desmear operation","two-dimensional warping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"QAM transmission through a companding channel/spl minus/signal constellations and detection","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","accessionNumber":"4684375","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM transmission through a companding channel/spl minus/signal constellations and detection","sourcePdf":"00577069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026637S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","articleId":"577069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":577070,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Using a maximum-likelihood approach, an optimum decision metric is derived and shown to take the form of a weighted sum of the ideal coherent decision metric (i.e., correlation) and the noncoherent decision metric which is optimum for differential detection of MPSK. The performance of a receiver based on this optimum decision rule is derived and shown to provide continued improvement with increasing length of observation interval (data symbol sequence length). Unfortunately increasing the observation length does not eliminate the error floor associated with the finite loop SNR. Nevertheless, in the limit of infinite observation length, the average error probability performance approaches the algebraic sum of the error floor and the performance of ideal coherent detection, i.e., at any error probability above the error floor, there is no degradation due to the partial coherence. While the above is strictly speaking only true in the limit of infinite observation length, it is shown that one can virtually achieve this limiting behavior with practical size observation lengths. Furthermore, the performance is quite insensitive to mismatch between the estimate of loop SNR (e.g., obtained from measurement) fed to the decision metric relative and its true value.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","startPage":"430","endPage":"439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple symbol partially coherent detection of MPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple symbol partially coherent detection of MPSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","accessionNumber":"4684376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple symbol partially coherent detection of MPSK","sourcePdf":"00577070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075166S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","articleId":"577070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577079,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

This appears to be one of the most important difficulties in managing faults in today's networks. The problem may become worse in the case of multiple faults. The authors present a general methodology for solving the alarm correlation and fault identification problem. They propose a new alarm structure, propose a general model for representing the network, and give two algorithms which can solve the alarm correlation and fault identification problem in the presence of multiple faults.

The position of the pulses in each signalling interval are derived from general binary constant weight codes. The combined coding and modulation of multiple pulses provides a minimum distance between any two signaling frames. Photon counting is used at the receiving end for noiseless optical channel in which only quantum noise exists. For noisy optical channel with avalanche photodetector, threshold demodulation is used in which an optical pulse is considered present in a slot where the photoelectron count exceeds a given threshold. It is shown that this multipulse system gives better performance than the conventional single pulse system. The performance analysis can be applied to and binary constant weight code since only the general parameters of length, minimum distance, and weight of the code are needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577084.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded multipulse modulation in optical communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Coded multipulse modulation in optical communication systems","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","accessionNumber":"4684389","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded multipulse modulation in optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00577084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037931S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","articleId":"577084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577085,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Power control is essential in the use of direct-sequence code division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques. Early system-level performance analyses of a CDMA approach to wireless mobile and personal communications have assumed the ability of power control to equalize the absolute signal powers of CDMA users received at each base station. The present paper studies a more practical, although analytically more complicated, uplink power control technique that uses measurements of the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) instead. A combination of discrete-event link simulation and analysis of the obtained SIR statistics is used to explore the previously little-known behavior of a CDMA system using SIR-based power control and to obtain performance estimates for such a system under various operating assumptions. The overall results indicate that power control based on SIR has the potential for somewhat higher system performance than power control based on absolute signal strength assumed in the early analyses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Statistics","Multiaccess communication","Feedback","Power control","Performance analysis","Signal analysis","Base stations","Power measurement","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","statistical analysis","radiofrequency interference","parameter estimation","personal communication networks","telecommunications control","power control","mobile radio systems","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference statistics","CDMA system","feedback power control","direct-sequence code division multiple-access techniques","system-level performance analyses","wireless mobile communications","personal communications","absolute signal powers","base station","uplink power control technique","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR","discrete-event link simulation","performance estimates"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577087","startPage":"597","endPage":"605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577087.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal and interference statistics of a CDMA system with feedback power control.

Under the assumption that the fading parameters are uncorrelated, this fading CDMA channel is shown to be equivalent to a Gaussian CDMA channel over which a modified signal set is employed. A fading counterpart of the multiuser asymptotic efficiency performance measure is defined. The asymptotic efficiencies of the optimum, decorrelating, and conventional detectors designed for the fading channel are derived. The conventional detector, which has low complexity, is shown to degrade rapidly in near-far environments. The optimal detector for the fading channel exhibits a significant improvement in performance but at the price of a computational complexity that increases exponentially with the number of users. The linear decorrelating detector for the fading case is optimally near-far resistant. The asymptotic efficiencies of multiuser detectors designed for the Gaussian channel when employed over the Rician fading channel are also obtained, thereby quantifying the loss in performance incurred by these mismatched detectors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12514/00577100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.577100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12514","startPage":"711","endPage":"722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detectors for synchronous CDMA communication over non-selective Rician fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detectors for synchronous CDMA communication over non-selective Rician fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"Feb-Apr 1994","accessionNumber":"4684404","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detectors for synchronous CDMA communication over non-selective Rician fading channels","sourcePdf":"00577100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052807S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","articleId":"577100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":577113,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Cellular neural networks (CNN) provide a new fast parallel computational method for VLSI image processing.

In this paper it is demonstrated that many of the feature mapping early vision effects can be simultaneously executed as convolution/deconvolution, cross-correlation, pattern-shifting, halftoning etc. The parameters of the CNN (a template) are trained through a genetic-like learning algorithm. Several types of Brodatz textures have been examined to test our method for classification and segmentation. Choosing 4 Brodatz textures which are close to each other in their main characteristics, they can be discriminated at a classification error of about 1-5% and segmentation error of about 5-10 pixels by using only one CNN template, even in the case of noisy or nonuniform CNN VLSI parameters. Using a 44*44 CNN array and one template, 16 Brodatz textures can be successfully discriminated.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1994.577209","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 2 - Conference B: Computer Vision & Image Processing.

Previous work has shown this problem to be tractable for a system of two processors or a linear array of N processors, and for distributed programs of serial parallel structures. Here we focus on the assignment problem on a homogeneous network, which is composed of N functionally-identical processors, each with its own memory. Some processors in the network may have unique resources, such as data files or certain peripheral devices. Certain tasks may have to use these unique resources; they are called attached tasks. The tasks of a distributed program should therefore be assigned so as to make use of specific resources located at certain processors in the network while minimizing the amount of interprocessor communication. The assignment problem in such a homogeneous network is known to be NP-hard even for N=3, thus making it intractable for a network with a medium to large number of processors. We therefore focus on task assignment in general array networks, such as linear arrays, meshes, hypercubes, and trees. We first develop a modeling technique that transforms the assignment problem in an array or tree into a minimum-cut maximum-flow problem. The assignment problem is then solved for a general array or tree network in polynomial time.","doi":"10.1109/71.577254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.577254","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/12529/00577254.pdf","startPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal task assignment in homogeneous networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577254/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal task assignment in homogeneous networks","volume":"8","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5517966","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal task assignment in homogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"00577254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032647S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"22","articleId":"577254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":577255,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When computation and communication are not overlapped, we show that the optimal number of processors needed is either 1 or p, depending on the ratio t/sub p//sup l//t/sub c/. When computation and communication are overlapped, we show that the optimal number of processors needed is either 1 or ([t/sub p//sup l//t/sub c/])b. We show that there is a unique arrangement of interfaces such that the total number of interfaces is minimum and the optimal time is reached.

However, loop fusion is not always legal. Even when legal, fusion may introduce loop-carried dependences which prevent parallelism. In addition, performance losses result from cache conflicts in fused loops. In this paper, we present new techniques to: (1) allow fusion of loop nests in the presence of fusion-preventing dependences, (2) maintain parallelism and allow the parallel execution of fused loops with minimal synchronization, and (3) eliminate cache conflicts in fused loops. We describe algorithms for implementing these techniques in compilers. The techniques are evaluated on a 56-processor KSR2 multiprocessor and on a 18-processor Convex SPP-1000 multiprocessor. The results demonstrate performance improvements for both kernels and complete applications. The results also indicate that careful evaluation of the profitability of fusion is necessary as more processors are used.","doi":"10.1109/71.577265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.577265","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/12529/00577265.pdf","startPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of loops for parallelism and locality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577265/","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of loops for parallelism and locality","volume":"8","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5517973","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of loops for parallelism and locality","sourcePdf":"00577265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049583S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"44","articleId":"577265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":577268,"authors":[{"name":"A.Y.

This core laboratory feeds into a network of satellite laboratories, which are designed to provide both vertical and horizontal integration of control systems and related technology across departmental boundaries in the engineering curriculum. By elevating control systems laboratory development from the department level to the college level we have gained a number of advantages including, more efficient use of space and equipment, better leveraging of funds, elimination of overlap among individual departmental labs, better integration of control systems technology in the curriculum the ability to hire a full time professional to manage the laboratory, and increased visibility with industry. At the same time we retain the integrity and autonomy of the separate departmental curricula. This paper describes our concept and our initial experiences in this laboratory development.

While in autonomous systems, the environmental credit gained as compared to diesel alternatives can be obtained through direct optimization, in grid-linked systems emission is another variable to be minimized such that the use of renewable energy can be justified. A controller that monitors the operation of the autonomous/grid-linked systems is designed. Such a controller determines the energy available from each of the system components and the environmental credit of the system.

Two conflicting objectives including minimization of fuel cost and environmental impact of emission are considered in this study. The Jacobian matrix is formulated by the incremental transmission loss in terms of the sensitivity factors, line flows and line resistances. The sensitivity factors are obtained from line flow solutions based on a DC load flow model. Moreover, the B-coefficients matrix and the Lagrange function can be shown as convex functions. Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the nonlinear equation of the MPD problem can be proven. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus systems. Simulation results obtained from the proposed method confirm the advantage of computation rapidity and solution accuracy over that of the AC load flow method and the conventional B-coefficients method, respectively. The comparison confirms the capability of the proposed method in real-time implementation for the MPD problem.","doi":"10.1109/60.577285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/12524/00577285.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.577285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective power dispatch with line flow constraints using the fast Newton-Raphson method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577285/","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective power dispatch with line flow constraints using the fast Newton-Raphson method","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5517031","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective power dispatch with line flow constraints using the fast Newton-Raphson method","sourcePdf":"00577285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065207S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"14","articleId":"577285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577288,"authors":[{"name":"Yangping Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yangping Zhao","id":"37087400008"},{"name":"R.M.

Based on this simplified model, a hybrid multi-input and multi-out (MIMO) control system, consisting of feedforward control (FFC) and feedback control (PEC), is designed for wide range conditions by using the genetic algorithm (GA) technique. The FFC control, obtained by the GA optimization method, injects an a priori command input into the system to achieve an optimal performance for the designed system, while the GA-based FBC control provides the necessary compensation for any disturbances or uncertainties in a real steam generator. The FBC control is an optimal design of a PI-based control system which would be more acceptable for industrial practices and nuclear power plant control system upgrades. The designed hybrid MIMO FFC/FBC control system is first applied to the simplified model and then to a more complicated model with a higher order which is used as a substitute of the real system to test the efficacy of the designed control system. Results from computer simulations show that the designed GA-based hybrid MIMO FFC/FBC control can achieve good responses and robust performances. Hence, it can be considered as a viable alternative to the current control system upgrades.","doi":"10.1109/60.577288","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/12524/00577288.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.577288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid feedforward and feedback controller design for nuclear steam generators over wide range operation using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Optimal control","Control systems","MIMO","Control system synthesis","Nuclear power generation","Power system modeling","Feedback control","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nuclear reactor steam generators","nuclear power stations","feedforward","feedback","control system synthesis","control system analysis computing","nuclear engineering computing","power engineering computing","optimal control","MIMO systems","genetic algorithms","two-term control","robust control","fission reactor theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nuclear steam generators","hybrid feedforward/feedback controller design","genetic algorithm technique","control design","MIMO control system","a priori command input","disturbance compensation","uncertainty compensation","control simulation","nuclear power plant control system upgrades","control response","computer simulation","robust performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid feedforward and feedback controller design for nuclear steam generators over wide range operation using genetic algorithm","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5517033","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid feedforward and feedback controller design for nuclear steam generators over wide range operation using genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00577288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07332S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"17","articleId":"577288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":577291,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

Starting with the cost and optimal value function V, CoHJB solves HJB PDEs \"backwards\" algebraically to produce nonlinear dynamics and optimal controllers and disturbances. Although useless for design, it is great for generating benchmark examples. It is easy to use, computationally tractable, and can generate essentially all possible nonlinear optimal control problems. The optimal control and disturbance are then known and can be used to study actual design methods, which must start with the cost and dynamics without knowledge of V. This paper gives a brief introduction to the CoHJB method and some of the ground rules for comparing various methods. Some very simple examples are given to illustrate the main ideas. Both Jacobian linearization and feedback linearization combined with linear optimal control are used as \"strawmen\" design methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5540307","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear games: examples and counterexamples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear games: examples and counterexamples","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00577292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026637S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"18","articleId":"577292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":577297,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yun Huang","id":"37087257536"},{"name":"Wei-Min Lu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Min Lu","id":"37087166692"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3590-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"577297","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Nonlinear equations","Riccati equations","Jacobian matrices","Linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov method","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Ear","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","optimal control","Riccati equations","matrix algebra","approximation theory","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","frozen Riccati equations","nonlinear matrix inequality","finite difference approximation","nonlinear systems","Hamilton-Jacobi equations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577297","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.577297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.577297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12517","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12517/00577297.pdf","startPage":"3942","endPage":"3947 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear optimal control: alternatives to Hamilton-Jacobi equation","abstract":"The methods of frozen Riccati equations and nonlinear matrix inequalities (NLMIs) offer certain computational advantages over Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJE), but may fail to be optimal.

It was found that pulsed laser ablation of transparent and weakly absorbing gels is always mediated by plasma. On the other hand, ablation of strongly absorbing tissues is mediated by plasma in the ultrashort-pulse range only. Ablation threshold along with plasma optical breakdown threshold decreases with increasing tissue absorbance for subnanosecond pulses. In contrast, the ablation threshold was found to be practically independent of tissue linear absorption for femtosecond laser pulses. The mechanism of optical breakdown at the tissue surface was theoretically investigated. In the nanosecond range of laser pulse duration, optical breakdown proceeds via avalanche ionization initiated by heating of electrons contributed by strongly absorbing impurities at the tissue surface. In the ultrashortpulse range, optical breakdown is initiated by multiphoton ionization of the irradiated medium (six photons in case of tissue irradiated at 1053-nm wavelength), and is less sensitive to linear absorption. High-quality ablation craters with no thermal or mechanical damage to surrounding material were obtained with subpicosecond laser pulses. Experimental results suggest that subpicosecond plasma mediated ablation can be employed as a tool for precise laser microsurgery of various tissues.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plasma mediated ablation of biological tissues with nanosecond-to-femtosecond laser pulses: relative role of linear and nonlinear absorption","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/2944.577302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/12536/00577302.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.577302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1996","displayDocTitle":"Plasma mediated ablation of biological tissues with nanosecond-to-femtosecond laser pulses: relative role of linear and nonlinear absorption","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1996","accessionNumber":"5624181","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plasma mediated ablation of biological tissues with nanosecond-to-femtosecond laser pulses: relative role of linear and nonlinear absorption","sourcePdf":"00577302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073091S","chronDate":"Dec 1996","isNumber":"12536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"39","articleId":"577302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577323,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.W.

Using ultrashort pulse illumination, depth-resolved whole-field images of three dimensional objects embedded in scattering media have been obtained. Bulk photorefractive crystals and photorefractive multiple quantum-well (MQW) devices have been investigated as the hologram recording element. Images have been obtained through media of up to 16 scattering mean free paths with a system based on bulk rhodium-doped barium titanate (Rh:BaTiO/sub 3/). Using MQW devices, a real-time image acquisition (<0.4 ms) has been demonstrated when imaging through eight scattering mean free paths.

While the common strategy is to use fluorescent dyes which show absorption and emission properties in the visible region (400-600 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, our efforts have been directed toward developing near-IR (700-1000 nm) fluorescence as a viable detection strategy for DNA sequencing. In this paper, we discuss our results concerning the use of near-IR fluorescence detection for DNA sequencing carried out in a capillary gel column, where the capillary column has an internal diameter of 75 /spl mu/m, and the loading level of DNA onto this column is in the nL regime, requiring ultra-sensitive detection. In addition, we discuss our efforts toward the development of a highly efficient, single lane, single fluor, base-calling strategy using lifetime discrimination of heavy-atom modified near-IR dyes. The dyes developed for this application contain an intramolecular heavy atom (halogen) on a remote section of the chromophore, resulting in a perturbation in the fluorescence lifetime without altering the absorption or emission maximum of the base chromophore. This will allow the dye series to be excited with a single laser with the fluorescence processed on a single detector and the identity of the terminal base accomplished via lifetime discrimination. In order to effectively carry out lifetime measurements during capillary electrophoretic separation of the oligonucleotides, a simple solid-state time-correlated single photon counting instrument was constructed.","doi":"10.1109/2944.577345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/12536/00577345.pdf","startPage":"1129","endPage":"1139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.577345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-infrared, laser-induced fluorescence detection for DNA sequencing applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577345/","displayDocTitle":"Near-infrared, laser-induced fluorescence detection for DNA sequencing applications","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1996","accessionNumber":"5624216","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-infrared, laser-induced fluorescence detection for DNA sequencing applications","sourcePdf":"00577345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095164S","chronDate":"Dec 1996","isNumber":"12536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"13","articleId":"577345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":577370,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The variable dispersion equalizer consists of an alternating cascade of symmetrical and asymmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometers. An equalizer with nine symmetrical and eight asymmetrical interferometers is fabricated on a planar lightwave circuit and its dispersion varied step by step from -681 to +786 ps/nm in the operational frequency range of 16.3 GHz. The effectiveness of the equalizer is shown by compensating the dispersion of three different fibers with a single equalizer. The performance of the equalizer is also evaluated and examined by numerical investigations.","doi":"10.1109/2944.577376","startPage":"270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/12535/00577376.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.577376","endPage":"276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable group-delay dispersion equalizer using lattice-form programmable optical filter on planar lightwave circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Variable group-delay dispersion equalizer using lattice-form programmable optical filter on planar lightwave circuit","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5541551","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable group-delay dispersion equalizer using lattice-form programmable optical filter on planar lightwave circuit","sourcePdf":"00577376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058034S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"12535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"43","articleId":"577376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":577378,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The order of the motion equation in ISM is equal to the order of the original system, rather than reduced by the number of dimension of the control input. As the result, robustness of the system can be guaranteed throughout an entire response of the system starting from the initial time instance. Uniform formulations of the ISM design principle are developed in the paper. It is shown through examples that our generalized ISM scheme enables a wide scope of application areas. In the case that the given control matrix can not be used directly for generating the sliding mode, the associated decoupling problem was also discussed based on the concept of sliding mode transformation. To alleviate chattering, we remove the discontinuous control action from the real control path and insert it to an internal dynamic process for generating the sliding mode.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1996.577594","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/4303/12517/00577594.pdf","startPage":"4591","endPage":"4596 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1996.577594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integral sliding mode in systems operating under uncertainty conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=577594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577594/","displayDocTitle":"Integral sliding mode in systems operating under uncertainty conditions","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5540407","conferenceDate":"13-13 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integral sliding mode in systems operating under uncertainty conditions","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00577594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030916S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303","citationCount":"388","articleId":"577594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":577625,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

Solid-state MIMICs have made a dramatic impact on capability, reliability, and cost of these sensor systems. However, the computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools necessary for the modeling and simulation of such complex systems has not kept pace. This paper presents a methodology for the utilization of neurocomputing technology to achieve enhanced yield and efficient yield prediction in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. Specifically, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are employed to model complex relationships between material and device characteristics at critical stages of the semiconductor fabrication process. Additionally, a methodology for the development of ANN models of MIMIC passive elements based on the elements physical parameters is described. Results are presented which illustrate that a ANN can predict the equivalent circuit parameters (ECPs) and/or the scattering-parameters of these passive elements to nearly the same degree of accuracy as that afforded by electromagnetic (EM) simulation.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.1997.577996","startPage":"489","endPage":"508 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.1997.577996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12428","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4328/12428/00577996.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for the design and fabrication of integrated circuits for aerospace applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/577996/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for the design and fabrication of integrated circuits for aerospace applications","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5629631","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-13 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Feb. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for the design and fabrication of integrated circuits for aerospace applications","confLoc":"Snowmass, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00577996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052142S","chronDate":"13-13 Feb. 1997","isNumber":"12428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4328","articleId":"577996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":578192,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Feng Liu","affiliation":["School of Mater.

Detection and localization of epileptic seizures are illustrated through design of a matched filter based on these patterns.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579256","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"891","endPage":"892 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12476","pdfPath":"/iel3/4363/12476/00579256.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Epilepsy","Chirp","Spectrogram","Statistics","Medical signal detection","Disk recording","Matched filters","Electroencephalography","Frequency","Drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","spectral analysis","medical signal processing","signal detection","matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECoG recordings","epileptic seizures detection","epileptic seizures localization","chirp-like patterns","brain surface","signal-processing tool","electrocorticograms","electrodiagnostics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Matched-filter based detection and localization of epileptic seizures from spectrographic chirps in ECoG recordings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/579256/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5690334","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched-filter based detection and localization of epileptic seizures from spectrographic chirps in ECoG recordings","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00579256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046989S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"12476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"1","articleId":"579256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":579382,"authors":[{"name":"I.N.

To take full advantage of this intimate contact, it is necessary to use stimulating parameters that generate highly localized excitation fields. Previous studies have investigated modulation of either amplitude or pulse width while fixing the other at a value that either maximized a threshold difference or minimized a charge injection. The authors' results suggest that combined modulation of both pulse width and amplitude can provide enhanced neural stimulation selectivity and augment the functional capabilities of neural electrodes. These results support the hypothesis that pulse amplitude determines the spatial extent of a stimulation field and pulse width determines the percentage of recruitment within that field. The authors conclude by discussing functional and design advantages suggested by their results and possible mechanisms currently being investigated to explain the observed phenomenon.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Amplitude modulation","Recruitment","Nerve fibers","Biomedical electrodes","Contacts","Cats","Student members","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrodes","muscle","neurophysiology","bioelectric phenomena","biological techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse width","pulse amplitude","functional selectivity enhancement","neural stimulation","neural electrode design advances","stimulating parameters","highly localized excitation fields","neural recruitment percentage","charge injection","combined modulation","acute cat experiments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579538","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel3/4363/12476/00579538.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1110 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined modulation of pulse width and pulse amplitude to enhance functional selectivity of neural stimulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=579538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combined modulation of pulse width and pulse amplitude to enhance functional selectivity of neural stimulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/579538/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5709105","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined modulation of pulse width and pulse amplitude to enhance functional selectivity of neural stimulation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00579538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028564S","chronDate":"20-23 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"1","articleId":"579538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":579545,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The ICS incorporates a method for automatic generation of control rules for rule-based control. The rules are extracted from a set of sensory feedback signals and stimulation control signals recorded during FES-assisted walking controlled by a skilled therapist or the subject. The rule-generation method uses Adaptive Logic Networks (ALNs), a type of artificial neural network. The ICS provides a very efficient tool to acquire sensory and control signals, to process these signals, to train the ALNs in mapping the control function, to test the trained ALNs, and to use them for control signal generation in real-time control of the FES-assisted walking. Through experimental work it's been demonstrated that ALNs are able to generate control rules quickly and to generalize not only over daily subsequent walking sessions but also over the sessions occurring several days after the training, which provides a good basis for design of robust control systems for FES-assisted walking. Evaluation of new subjects and automatic generation of control rules using ICS is possible within minutes compared to classic 'hand-crafting' methods which usually require weeks.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579578","pdfPath":"/iel3/4363/12476/00579578.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1148 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated control system for FES-assisted locomotion after spinal cord injury","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/579578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Integrated control system for FES-assisted locomotion after spinal cord injury","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5709124","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated control system for FES-assisted locomotion after spinal cord injury","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00579578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033594S","chronDate":"20-23 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4363","citationCount":"7","articleId":"579578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":579664,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

The aim of this work is the evaluation of vibromyographic (VMG) signals from the sternomastoid muscle, in order to study the muscle function in a ventilatory test. Simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded and a comparative analysis with VMG was done. Results from a group of 6 patients with COPD are shown, following two respiratory tests. The root-mean-square (RMS) showed the same behaviour of VMG and EMG signals in both tests. H/L ratios of power spectral density pointed out muscle fatigue in the last steps of the respiratory test. Cross-correlation of EMG and VMG found different patterns of relationship between the electrical and mechanical activity of muscle and allow the study of EMG-VMG time delay, during execution of respiratory load tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology
