To reduce the number of errors at the detection due in particular to Multiple Access Interference (MAI), we add to the OCDMA link a block of efficient error correction codes named Low Density Parity Check codes (LDPC). The LDPC decoding algorithm, Belief Propagation (BP), usually employed to correct errors due to Gaussian noise, is reconsidered in order to take into account the MAI binomial distribution. The performance of an OCDMA link using 1 Dimensional and 2 Dimensional code sequences along with several LDPC codes is investigated. The performance is enhanced not only in an ideal case with only MAI, but also in a noisy case with MAI and thermal noise. With such error correction coding scheme, the constraints over OCDMA parameters and the signal to noise ratio are greatly relaxed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9876835","htmlLink":"/document/4300029/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of Optical CDMA Systems with Low Density Parity Check Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Optical CDMA Systems with Low Density Parity Check Codes","confLoc":"Cap Eterel, France","sourcePdf":"29380057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086402S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4299965","isNumber":"4299966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4299965","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4299966","articleId":"4300029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4300041,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Behavior recognition of traffic is a process by which the ongoing observed behavior of a host is tracked and compared by a given model. Various methods for behavior recognition exist. But incorporation of Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) for anomaly detection (ARP anomaly detection, especially) is a novel method. This paper aims at classifying the network ARP traffic as an abnormal or normal using a special HMM. The paper's main objective is to build a statistical anomaly detection system, a predictive model capable of discrimination between normal and abnormal behavior of network ARP traffic. The proposed method is unique in this aspect that by applying a modified HMM presents a host-based ARP anomaly detection algorithm with very high accuracy. We applied the method in a real campus network and observed a precision of above 90%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4299965/4299966/04300041.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2007.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2007.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4299966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ARP-based Anomaly Detection Algorithm Using Hidden Markov Model in Enterprise Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Hidden Markov models","Telecommunication traffic","Switches","Traffic control","Access protocols","IP networks","Complex networks","Backplanes","Packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business communication","hidden Markov models","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARP","anomaly detection algorithm","hidden Markov model","enterprise networks","statistical anomaly detection system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)","Anomaly Detection","Hidden Markov Model (HMM)."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An ARP-based Anomaly Detection Algorithm Using Hidden Markov Model in Enterprise Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300041/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9876847","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","conferenceDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ARP-based Anomaly Detection Algorithm Using Hidden Markov Model in Enterprise Networks","confLoc":"Cap Eterel, France","sourcePdf":"29380069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053449S","chronDate":"25-31 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4299965","isNumber":"4299966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4299965","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4299966","articleId":"4300041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4300073,"authors":[{"name":"Amir M.

Furthermore, the microchip has much simpler design and smaller footprint compared to the rectangular serpentine continuous flow (CF) PCR devices.","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.2007.4300148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.2007.4300148","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","displayPublicationTitle":"TRANSDUCERS 2007 - 2007 International Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4300055/4300056/04300148.pdf","publicationTitle":"TRANSDUCERS 2007 - 2007 International Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Circular Ferro-Fluid Driven Flow-Through Microchip for Rapid DNA Amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Circular Ferro-Fluid Driven Flow-Through Microchip for Rapid DNA Amplification","conferenceDate":"10-14 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300148/","accessionNumber":"9828496","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300148/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Circular Ferro-Fluid Driven Flow-Through Microchip for Rapid DNA Amplification","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"SENSOR-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062512S","chronDate":"10-14 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4300055","isNumber":"4300056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300055","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4300056","articleId":"4300148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4300149,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon-Kyoung Cho","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Kyoung","lastName":"Cho","id":"37713743100"},{"name":"Jeong-Gun Lee","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Gun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185816100"},{"name":"Jong-Myeon Park","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Myeon","lastName":"Park","id":"37716833100"},{"name":"Beom-Seok Lee","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Beom-Seok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37716930100"},{"name":"Youngsun Lee","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngsun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37716937300"},{"name":"Christopher Ko","affiliation":["Bio Device Research Laboratories, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Ko","id":"37715788600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0841-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0842-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-547X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1641"}],"articleNumber":"4300149","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"We could, for the first time, demonstrate a fully integrated pathogen specific DNA extraction from whole blood utilizing centrifugal microfluidics on a polymer based CD platform.

We used the readily available layers as given by the technology without any customization or post-processing. Careful design measures were taken to ensure planar junction breakdown. Compared with a p+/n- diode, a p-/n- SPAD has relative deep junction, wide depletion region, and thus improves probability of photon detection. The measurement shows a maximum photon detection efficiency of 34.4%, and remains above 20% from 400 nm to 620 nm, whereas the dark count rate is only 50 cps at room temperature with 5 V excess voltage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300396/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300396/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9828733","conferenceDate":"10-14 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Single Photon Avalanche Diode in CMOS High-Voltage Technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Single Photon Avalanche Diode in CMOS High-Voltage Technology","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"SENSOR-00-340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046904S","chronDate":"10-14 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4300055","isNumber":"4300056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300055","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4300056","articleId":"4300396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4300423,"authors":[{"name":"Jerome Laine","affiliation":["SERCEL, Carquefou, France"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Laine","id":"37706144300"},{"name":"Denis Mougenot","affiliation":["SERCEL, Carquefou, France"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Mougenot","id":"37705501800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0841-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0842-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-547X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1641"}],"articleNumber":"4300423","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":967},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Micromechanical devices","Accelerometers","Petroleum","Gas detectors","Coils","Hydrocarbons","Seismic measurements","Motion measurement","Reflection","Seismic waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","geophysical prospecting","microsensors","oil technology","seismic waves","seismometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seismic accelerometers","oil exploration","digital sensors","analog moving coil geophones","hydrocarbon seismic exploration","MEMS digital accelerometers","ground motion","seismic waves","subsurface imaging","broadband linear response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Seismic sensor","MEMS","accelerometer","geophone"]}],"abstract":"MEMS based digital sensors are compared with conventional analog moving coil geophones used in the hydrocarbon seismic exploration.

The fabricated microfluidic valve was tested with liquids flowing in the microchannels under capillary action. It is shown that the valve selectively regulates the flow of test samples.

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the mechanical NVM as a new memory for ULSI applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dram-Like Mechanical Non-Volatile Memory","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.2007.4300601","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.2007.4300601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300056","publicationTitle":"TRANSDUCERS 2007 - 2007 International Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TRANSDUCERS 2007 - 2007 International Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4300055/4300056/04300601.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Dram-Like Mechanical Non-Volatile Memory","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300601/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9828927","conferenceDate":"10-14 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dram-Like Mechanical Non-Volatile Memory","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"SENSOR-00-545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071166S","chronDate":"10-14 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4300055","isNumber":"4300056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300055","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4300056","articleId":"4300601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4300737,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Broadcasting of safety messages is one of the fundamental services in DSRC. In this paper, requirements and channel design of vehicular ad hoc networks for safety applications are addressed. Performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) safety related services in DSRC system on highway is investigated analytically and by simulation. Under some reasonable assumptions, analysis is conducted to characterize IEEE 802.11a-based channel for safety message broadcast under harsh DSRC highway environment with high vehicle mobility, dynamic self-organized network topology, and adverse multi-path fading channel. Based on solutions to the proposed analytic model, transmission delay and packet reception rates are derived. The proposed analytic model accounts for impact of priority access, message arrival interval, hidden terminal problem, fading transmission channel, and highly mobile vehicles on performance indices for DSRC safety related communication. From the obtained numerical results under various offered traffic and network parameters, new observations and effective enhancement suggestions are given.","doi":"10.1109/MOVE.2007.4300809","publicationTitle":"2007 Mobile Networking for Vehicular Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mobile Networking for Vehicular Environments","pdfPath":"/iel5/4300797/4300798/04300809.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOVE.2007.4300809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay and Broadcast Reception Rates of Highway Safety Applications in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-11 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300809/","displayDocTitle":"Delay and Broadcast Reception Rates of Highway Safety Applications in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10299994","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300809/","conferenceDate":"11-11 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and Broadcast Reception Rates of Highway Safety Applications in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"MOVE-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056633S","chronDate":"11-11 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4300797","isNumber":"4300798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300797","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4300798","articleId":"4300809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4300813,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhua Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Michigan, Dearborn, USA"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37290749000"},{"name":"John P.

Our results clearly show that broadcasting in VANET is very different from routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) due to several reasons such as network topology, mobility patterns, demographics, traffic patterns at different times of the day, etc. These differences imply that conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as DSR and AODV will not be appropriate in VANETs for most vehicular broadcast applications. We identify three very different regimes that a vehicular broadcast protocol needs to work in: i) dense traffic regime; ii) sparse traffic regime; and iii) regular traffic regime. We build upon our previously proposed routing solutions for each regime and we show that the broadcast message can be disseminate efficiently. The proposed design of the distributed vehicular broadcast (DV-CAST) protocol integrates the use of various routing solutions we have previously proposed.","doi":"10.1109/MOVE.2007.4300825","publicationTitle":"2007 Mobile Networking for Vehicular Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mobile Networking for Vehicular Environments","pdfPath":"/iel5/4300797/4300798/04300825.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOVE.2007.4300825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300798","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcasting in VANET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Broadcasting in VANET","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-11 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300825/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-11 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10300003","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4300825/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcasting in VANET","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"MOVE-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057621S","chronDate":"11-11 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4300797","isNumber":"4300798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4300797","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"4300798","articleId":"4300825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4300848,"authors":[{"name":"Joost Brouckaert","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University-Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Joost","lastName":"Brouckaert","id":"37298270200"},{"name":"Gunther Roelkens","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University-Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gunther","lastName":"Roelkens","id":"37268325900"},{"name":"Dries Van Thourhout","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University-Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dries","lastName":"Van Thourhout","id":"37278007000"},{"name":"Roel Baets","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University-Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Baets","id":"37277878900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4300848","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":501},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photodetectors","Silicon on insulator technology","Semiconductor waveguides","Wavelength measurement","Semiconductor thin films","Thin film devices","Substrates","Bonding","Detectors","Dark current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","dark conductivity","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","integrated optoelectronics","metal-semiconductor-metal structures","optical waveguides","photodetectors","silicon-on-insulator","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["InAlAs-InGaAs","current 4.5 nA","wavelength 1550 nm","size 30 mum","dark current","detector responsivity","divinyldisiloxane benzocyclobutene","low-temperature die-to-wafer bonding","thin-film devices","silicon-on-insulator waveguides","metal-semiconductor-metal photodetector","MSM photodetector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous integration","photodetector","photonic integrated circuit","silicon-on-insulator (SOI)"]}],"abstract":"We present measurement results of compact and efficient InAlAs-InGaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors integrated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides.

Therefore, a new modeling and control strategy of a five-level three-phase diode-clamped inverter (DCI) is presented. The obtained modeling shows that modulated multilevel voltages are obtained by combination of eight different three-level functions, which are called modulation functions. Therefore, a space-vector scheme without using a Park transform is explained. Based on this algorithm, the location of the reference voltage vector can be easily determined. Then, the voltage vectors are selected to generate corresponding levels and simultaneously their durations are calculated. More over, the redundancies of different switch configurations for the generation of intermediate voltages are used to limit the deviation of capacitor voltages. Experimental results are given to illustrate the proposed control strategy of the three-phase three-level diode clamped inverter. Then, obtained results for a five-level three-phase DCI with the extended version of the control strategy are presented to show the good performances of the proposed balancing modulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9632936","htmlLink":"/document/4300862/","displayDocTitle":"DC Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing in a Three-Phase Diode Clamped Inverter Controlled by a Direct Space Vector of Line-to-Line Voltages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing in a Three-Phase Diode Clamped Inverter Controlled by a Direct Space Vector of Line-to-Line Voltages","sourcePdf":"22tpel05-bouhali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161716S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4300856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4300856","articleId":"4300862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4300864,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Yat-Chung Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4300856/4300864/4300864-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julian Yat-Chung Chiu (S'04) received the B.Eng. and M.Phil. degrees in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Research Assistant with the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.

The concept is based on using the natural response of the power stage to formulate a logarithmic function to approximate the ideal switching surface. With the proposed control method, the inverter exhibits better dynamic responses than the ones with the first-order or recently proposed second-order switching surfaces. It will also be shown that the first- order and second-order switching surfaces are the low-order approximations of high-order switching surface. As the high-order switching surface is close to the ideal switching surface, its high trajectory velocity along the switching surface makes the inverter state trajectory move toward the steady-state operating point in two switching actions under large-signal disturbances. The effects of the parametric variations on the output voltage and the large- signal characteristics of the inverter will be discussed. The proposed control method has been successfully applied to a 300-W, 110-V, 60-Hz, single-phase full-bridge inverter. The steady-state and large-signal dynamic behaviors of the inverter supplying to resistive, nonlinear inductive, and full-wave rectifier loads will be given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9632938","htmlLink":"/document/4300864/","displayDocTitle":"High-Order Switching Surface in Boundary Control of Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Order Switching Surface in Boundary Control of Inverters","sourcePdf":"22tpel05-chiu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153568S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4300856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4300856","articleId":"4300864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4300870,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Forest","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectrotechnique de Montpellier (LEM), Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4300856/4300870/4300870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francois Forest (M'98) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, Cachan, France, in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Paris 6, Paris, France, in 1985.","From 1989 to 1999, he was a Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, and Leader of the Power Electronics research group in the Laboratoire Electricit\u00e9, Signaux et Robotique, ESA CNRS 8029 (LESiR).

The cells are interconnected through intercell transformers replacing the standard multi-winding inductors used as insulation and storage magnetic device in the flyback. The combination of the interleaving effects and of the intercell transformer characteristics allows eliminating the mains limitations of the standard flyback due to the low performances of multiwindings inductors. In a first part, the different ways to interleave galvanic insulated converters as forward or flyback are briefly recalled. The second part presents the intercell transformers and shows that they can be used to interconnect interleaved converters cells. In the third and last part, this particular magnetic interconnection is applied to interleaved flyback cells and leads to create an ldquointercell transformer flybackrdquo. Its specific properties and advantages are described.

Total harmonic distortion of the current, fed into the grid, is restricted as per the IEEE-519 standard. The proposed topology has several desirable features such as better utilization of the PV array, higher efficiency, low cost and compact size. Further, due to the very nature of the proposed topology, the PV array appears as a floating source to the grid, thereby enhancing the overall safety of the system. A survey of the existing topologies, suitable for single-stage, grid connected PV applications, is carried out and a detailed comparison with the proposed topology is presented. A complete steady-state analysis, including the design procedure and expressions for peak device stresses, is included.

Employing slight topological modifications, soft-switching technology can be applied to multilevel converters to reduce the switching losses. As a result, the switching frequency can be increased, thereby reducing the output filter size. However, common converter controls have to be modified. In this paper, a flexible control platform is presented that allows rapid prototyping of soft-switching topologies. An analysis of different auxiliary resonant commutated pole (ARCP) topologies shows that all switching commands can be synthesized with synchronized signals of two-level ARCP converters. Therefore, a flexible state-machine for two-level converters was developed first, which can also be used to build controls for multilevel topologies. It supports drivers with built-in intelligence as well as the control of additional switches that are required in some ARCP neutral-point-clamped (NPC) topologies. The switching commands for the state machines can be generated by standard multilevel modulation methods. Illegal switching states are filtered and multiple simultaneous commutations per phase are prevented for ARCP NPC converters. To verify the functionality, the control scheme was realized in a field programmable gate array and a completely modular test converter was developed. This test converter can be used to quickly implement all common multilevel topologies and test different modulation strategies. Experimental results are presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.904216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.904216","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4300856/04300882.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Flexible Control Platform for Soft-Switching Multilevel Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Flexible Control Platform for Soft-Switching Multilevel Inverters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300882/","accessionNumber":"9632951","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300882/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Flexible Control Platform for Soft-Switching Multilevel Inverters","sourcePdf":"22tpel05-kollensperger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059738S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4300856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4300856","articleId":"4300882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4300884,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Lascu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Politehnica Timi&oara, Timisoara, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4300856/4300884/4300884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristian Lascu received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania, in 1995 and 2002, respectively.","In 1995, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, University Politehnica Timisoara where his research was focused on power electronics and high performance electrical drives.

Due to rapid penetration of power electronics equipment, many of the loads within distributed generation systems are nonlinear in nature, and the resulting harmonics pollution needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a new cooperative harmonic filtering strategy for the interface converters of distributed generation sources. A droop control method based on the reactive volt-ampere consumption of harmonics of each interface converter is designed and implemented. In this strategy, the overall harmonic filtering workload can be evenly shared without any communications. The operation principle is explained in detail.

Electrical behaviour of the input of buck-boost converter in discontinuous current mode turns out to be in perfect agreement with the considered optimization criteria with a very simple, sensorless control. Experimental results show that the converter controlled by a very low consumption circuit effectively maximizes the power flow into a 4.8 V rechargeable battery connected to the converter output. The converter's efficiency is above 84% for input voltages between 1.6 and 5.5 V, and for output powers between 200 muW and 1.5 mW.

The virtual flux method is used to extract the mains voltage from the switching state, dc voltage, and line currents. From the desired real and reactive powers the three-phase currents are generated using a DHC. The DHC avoids the switching interaction between the phases, and when a variable hysteresis band is employed a near constant switching frequency is achieved. The method is also extended for high power inverter applications that include an inductance- capacitance-inductance output filter, where some undesirable characteristic, such as filter resonance, have to be compensated.

This concept can not only simplify a two-level scheme, but is also suited for multilevel implementation. Since it can be implemented without any multiplier or divider, the fast algorithm is especially suitable for field programmable gate array applications. Then, an area- and speed-efficient IP-core based on this algorithm is built and tested. It ensures lower hardware resource usage, and at the same time, operates several times faster than some reported examples.

The validity of the system design is confirmed by experimental results obtained from a 400-V, 15-kW laboratory system. The experimental results show that the active filter plays an essential role in reducing supply harmonic currents. The total harmonic distortion of the supply current gets less than 5%. Moreover, the hybrid filter provides satisfactory transient performance as a result of having achieved an optimal design of circuit and control parameters including the dc capacitor voltage and feedback gains of the active filter, along with the cutoff frequency of high-pass filters for harmonic extraction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4300856/04300904.pdf","startPage":"1882","endPage":"1889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.904166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.904166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance of a Transformerless Shunt Hybrid Filter Integrated Into a Three-Phase Diode Rectifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Rectifiers","Active filters","Passive filters","Current supplies","Power harmonic filters","Frequency conversion","Pulse width modulation converters","Laboratories","Total harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","passive filters","power harmonic filters","PWM power convertors","rectifying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformerless shunt hybrid filter","three phase diode rectifier","three phase passive filter","seventh harmonic frequency","three phase voltage source pulsewidth modulation converter","supply harmonic currents","total harmonic distortion","voltage 400 V","power 15 kW","small-rated active filter","PWM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active filters","diode rectifiers","harmonics","hybrid filters","passive filters","power conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of a Transformerless Shunt Hybrid Filter Integrated Into a Three-Phase Diode Rectifier","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4300904/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9632971","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of a Transformerless Shunt Hybrid Filter Integrated Into a Three-Phase Diode Rectifier","sourcePdf":"22tpel05-tangtheerajaroonwong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070377S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4300856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4300856","articleId":"4300904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4300906,"authors":[{"name":"Vatche Vorperian","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4300856/4300906/4300906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vatch\u00e9 Vorp\u00e9rian received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1984.","He joined the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, in 1984.

In conventional bidirectional converters, transformer-based circuit topologies are commonly employed and soft-switching techniques including zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) or zero-current-switching (ZCS) are frequently applied to mitigate corresponding switching losses. Unfortunately, switches of four and upward in these transformer-based schemes increase production costs and reduce conversion efficiency. In this study, a coupled-inductor bidirectional converter scheme utilizes only three power switches to fulfill the objective of bidirectional current control. The high step-up and step-down ratios enable a battery module with a low voltage to be injected into a high-voltage dc bus for subsequent utilization. Some experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed bidirectional converter. Since the techniques of voltage clamping, synchronous rectification and soft switching are exploited in this circuit topology, and the corresponding device specifications are adequately fulfilled, it can provide high-efficiency bidirectional power conversion for power sources with large voltage diversity.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.904167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4300856/04300907.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.904167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional Converter for Power Sources With Great Voltage Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional Converter for Power Sources With Great Voltage Diversity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300907/","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4300907/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9632974","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional Converter for Power Sources With Great Voltage Diversity","sourcePdf":"22tpel05-wai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09906S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4300856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4300856","articleId":"4300907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4300914,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4300856/4300914/4300914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Zhu received the undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1989, the M.S.E.E. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, in 2004.","He is presently a Design Engineer with the Linear Technology Corporation and has worked there as an Application Engineer from 2004 to 2006.

The device consists of a monolithic array of concatenated semiconductor optical amplifiers and saturable absorbers. We have theoretically investigated picosecond pulse transmission through these devices. The parameters used in the simulation are representative for InP-InGaAsP bulk gain material, operating in the 1550-nm region. Operated as an optical amplifier for picosecond pulses, the simulation results show increased pulse peak amplification and decreased temporal broadening of the pulses for the IRIS devices as compared to a semiconductor optical amplifier of equivalent length. Used as a nonlinear element to increase the optical bandwidth of a picosecond pulse, the spectra obtained with IRIS devices show an increased broadening and smoothness as compared to a semiconductor optical amplifier. Finally the feasibility for using the IRIS device as an optical isolator is shown. It is operated in a regime where the device is transparent for a picosecond pulse train, while it is absorbent for lower power reflections.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2007.903363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2007.903363","startPage":"910","endPage":"922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4294077/04300918.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4294077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic Semiconductor Waveguide Device Concept for Picosecond Pulse Amplification, Isolation, and Spectral Shaping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic Semiconductor Waveguide Device Concept for Picosecond Pulse Amplification, Isolation, and Spectral Shaping","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4300918/","accessionNumber":"9633458","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300918/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic Semiconductor Waveguide Device Concept for Picosecond Pulse Amplification, Isolation, and Spectral Shaping","sourcePdf":"43jqe10-heck.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122728S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4294077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4294077","articleId":"4300918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4300920,"authors":[{"name":"Ross T.

Based on the magnetics analysis of Part I of the series, a design methodology is proposed for integrating a rotating transformer into a power electronic converter using the efficiency and voltage gain plots. It is shown that a phase-shifted full-bridge topology can effectively utilize the parasitic components of the transformer. The increased magnetizing current assists the resonant transition, and this, in turn, compensates for the increased conduction losses that a rotating transformer yields. The proposed design method secures the soft-switching operation of the converter over the entire load range and allows efficient operation and reduced electromagnetic emissions. The methodology is evaluated experimentally, and the resulting prototype demonstrates an average efficiency of 92.6% in the 0.2-1-kW output power range. The proposed topology extends the power capacity of the rotating transformer without compromising its size, cost, or performance.

Transferring electrical energy from a stationary to a moving device involves wearable parts such as slip rings and brushes. This paper examines the possibility of using a rotating transformer for contactless transfer of energy from the base to the revolving platform of an airborne radar system. The first part of the series focuses on the magnetic interface, investigating its electrical properties and their association with the core and windings geometry. The reader will gain an understanding of the merits and limitations of this technology and will be able to assess its suitability for other applications. The effects of the increased leakage and reduced magnetizing inductances of the transformer are investigated, and two winding layouts are proposed and characterized by measurements and finite-element analysis. Some equations are presented along with practical guidelines on designing a rotating transformer with a 0.25-2-mm air gap. The transformer voltage gain and efficiency plots are introduced as performance-assessment tools. The impact of the air-gap stray flux on the winding conduction losses is shown, and some electromagnetic-compatibility considerations are presented. Finally, a mechanical layout for a 1-kW rotating transformer is proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Airborne Radar Power Supply With Contactless Transfer of Energy\u2014Part I: Rotating Transformer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.902044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4282101/04300926.pdf","startPage":"2874","endPage":"2884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.902044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Airborne Radar Power Supply With Contactless Transfer of Energy\u2014Part I: Rotating Transformer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4300926/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Airborne Radar Power Supply With Contactless Transfer of Energy\u2014Part I: Rotating Transformer","sourcePdf":"54tie05-papastergiou2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042503S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4300926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4300977,"authors":[{"name":"Hasari Celebi","affiliation":["University of South Florida, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hasari Celebi [StM] (hcelebi@eng.usf.edu) received his B.S. degree in electronics and communications engineering in 2000 from Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, and his M.S. in electrical engineering in 2004 from San Jose State University, California.

This contribution starts with a brief section that underlines the paramount importance of the mobile radio communications channel. Then, spectrum issues are discussed to emphasize the reasons for spectrum scarcity as well as the importance of dynamic spectrum allocation. Some remarks about the development of software defined radio from digital radio lead to a discussion of the most important engineering aspects of CR, for example, location and spectrum awareness, transmission power control, and signal analysis. Because usually papers about CR are somewhat visionary, we first describe practical steps to an implementation of helpful CR properties into a mobile communication base station, as well as user terminal equipment.

A radio that has the core of its functionality implemented in software is called a software-defined radio. When an SDR has the capability to sense, reason, and dynamically adapt to requirements and environmental change, we call this more capable device a cognitive radio. Many private and public agencies are investing in the promise of CR to improve the utilization of radio frequency spectrum. They envision devices that can sense frequency vacancies and dynamically reconfigure to utilize idle channels. The promise of CR depends on the capability of a radio to change operating frequencies, power, and/or modulation schemes (physical layer flexibility). In addition to this physical layer flexibility, there are a large number of opportunities to capitalize on the interplay of the CR physical layer configuration and other parameters in the radio network protocol stack. At the core of CR functionality is the ability to select from thousands of potential configurations to maximize performance-be it in terms of spectrum use, throughput, or reliability. In this article, we describe a method for selecting from a number of potential configurations to fulfill the communication requirements of a CR network. By using accepted statistical methods, we show how parameters at the physical, data link, network, and application layers interact to affect performance. We build upon this parametric insight with our presentation of a technique for predicting radio performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Method for Reconfiguration of Cognitive Radios","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2007.4300981","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4300972/04300981.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2007.4300981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4300972","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4300981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Method for Reconfiguration of Cognitive Radios","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4300981/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","publicationDate":"August 2007","accessionNumber":"9610077","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Method for Reconfiguration of Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"WEINGART.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105223S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4300972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4300972","articleId":"4300981","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4300982,"authors":[{"name":"David Wilkins","affiliation":["SRI International, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David E.

To date, most cognitive radio research has focused on policy-based radios that are hard-coded with a list of rules on how the radio should behave in certain scenarios. Some work has been done on radios with learning engines tailored for very specific applications. This article describes a concrete model for a generic cognitive radio to utilize a learning engine. The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful. We describe how our generic cognitive engine can tackle problems such as capacity maximization and dynamic spectrum access.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","volume":"14","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9624485","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","publicationDate":"August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4300983/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Machine Learning to Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Machine Learning to Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"CLANCY.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036448S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4300972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"4300972","articleId":"4300983","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4300985,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Alberty","affiliation":["EADS ASTRIUM, France"],"bio":{"p":["Eric Alberty graduated from Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications.

The DVB-S standard, conceived for broadcasting applications, considers a fixed coding rate and modulation format that are selected according to the assumed coverage and availability requirements. This approach implies the occurrence of high margins in the majority of the cases, when interference and propagation conditions allow for higher signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio. The adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) introduction in the new DVB-S2 standard for the interactive service profile opens up a number of appealing opportunities for the design and development of satellite broadband networks. In this article we show how the ACM introduction in the satellite downlink enables greatly enhanced system performance but also has a profound impact on the way the system and some of the key system components are designed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4300985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4300985/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","publicationDate":"August 2007","accessionNumber":"9624487","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Coding and Modulation for the DVB-S2 Standard Interactive Applications: Capacity Assessment and Key System Issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Coding and Modulation for the DVB-S2 Standard Interactive Applications: Capacity Assessment and Key System Issues","sourcePdf":"GAUDENZI.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06364S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4300972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4300972","articleId":"4300985","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4300986,"authors":[{"name":"Cheolhee Park","affiliation":["University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Cheolhee Park received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1995 and 1997, respectively.

An energy harvesting device (e.g., a solar cell) converts different forms of environmental energy into electricity to be supplied to a sensor node. However, since it can produce energy only at a limited rate, energy saving mechanisms play an important role to reduce energy consumption in a sensor node. In this article we present an overview of the different energy harvesting technologies and the energy saving mechanisms for wireless sensor networks. The related research issues on energy efficiency for sensor networks using energy harvesting technology are then discussed. To this end, we present an optimal energy management policy for a solar-powered sensor node that uses a sleep and wakeup strategy for energy conservation. The problem of determining the sleep and wakeup probabilities is formulated as a bargaining game. The Nash equilibrium is used as the solution of this game.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless

separation and equalization for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) convolutive systems is addressed. We propose a new approach based on the constant modulus (CM) and second order criteria, from which a reduced complexity version is derived. The proposed algorithm allows to find an equalizer with a desired delay, which makes it possible to remove the delay ambiguity inherent to blind equalization of MIMO convolutive systems. Furthermore, it was shown that when the delay is chosen in the middle of the interval of all possible delays, we get a better performance. Moreover, a recursive implementation of the proposed criterion via the Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm is also presented. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm over the classical constant modulus algorithm is illustrated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301229","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","startPage":"114","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Blind Adaptive Signal Separation and Equalization Algorithm for MIMO Convolutive Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Blind Adaptive Signal Separation and Equalization Algorithm for MIMO Convolutive Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301229/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301229/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Blind Adaptive Signal Separation and Equalization Algorithm for MIMO Convolutive Systems","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056153S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301231,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

Recent work in this area has shown the viability of certain methods that incorporate single-bit feedback from a beacon. This paper analyzes the behavior of the method (showing conditions for convergence in distribution and also giving a concrete way to calculate the final distribution of the convergent ball) and then generalizes the method in three ways. First, by incorporating both negative and positive feedback it is possible to double the convergence rate of the algorithm without adversely effecting the final variance. Second, a way of reducing the amount of energy required (by reducing the number of transmissions needed for convergence) is shown; its convergence and final variance can also be conveniently described. Finally, a wideband analog is proposed that operates in a decentralized manner to align the time delay (rather than the phase) between sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301231/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of a Class of Decentralized Beamforming Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of a Class of Decentralized Beamforming Algorithms","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047798S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4301234,"authors":[{"name":"Cassio G.

The spatiotemporal signal waveform is assumed constant but unknown, and is represented using a linear combination of spatial and temporal basis functions. The background noise is assumed to be spatially correlated with unknown covariance matrix. We obtain the maximum-likelihood estimates of the amplitude variability and signal waveform via a generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The expectation step involves a Kalman fixed-interval smoother which tracks the trial-to-trial amplitude variability while the maximization step estimates the signal waveform, spatial noise covariance, and LDSR model parameters.

We represent a 3D face by a set of level curves of geodesic function starting from the nose tip, which is invariant under isometric transformation of the surfaces. A pose change induces a special Euclidean transformation (a composition of a rotation and a translation) of the surface that represents a face and leads to the Euclidean transformation of the iso-geodesic curves. A change of facial expression induces isometric transformation of the iso-geodesic curves. Although the set of isometric transformations of a surface is larger than the set of Euclidean transformations in 3D, we assume that iso-geodesic curves undergo piecewise Euclidean transformations, i.e. the transformation of relatively small segments of the level curves is Euclidean. A Euclidean invariant integral signature for curves in 3D is presented in this paper. Euclidean invariant integral signature provides a classification of spatial curves which is independent of their position in 3D space and parameterization, and is not sensitive to noise. A recognition procedure based on comparing face feature in the invariant signature space is proposed. Substantiating examples are provided with an achieved classification accuracy of 95% for faces with various poses and facial expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Euclidean Integral Invariants Signature","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301238","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301238.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Euclidean Integral Invariants Signature","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301238/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition using Euclidean Integral Invariants Signature","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10942S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-01"},{"_id":4301243,"authors":[{"name":"Selin Aviyente","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Selin","lastName":"Aviyente","id":"37285066700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301243","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1872},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Electroencephalography","Matching pursuit algorithms","Sparse matrices","Image reconstruction","Biomedical signal processing","Pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries","Application software","Signal representations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical signal processing","Electroencephalography","Signal Reconstruction","Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Many applications in signal processing require the efficient representation and processing of data. The traditional approach to efficient signal representation is compression. In recent years, there has been a new approach to compression at the sensing level. Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field which is based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an application of compressed sensing in the field of biomedical signal processing, particularly electroencophelogram (EEG) collection and storage. A compressed sensing framework is introduced for efficient representation of multichannel, multiple trial EEG data. The proposed framework is based on the revelation that EEG signals are sparse in a Gabor frame. The sparsity of EEG signals in a Gabor frame is utilized for compressed sensing of these signals. A simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is shown to be effective in the joint recovery of the original multiple trail EEG signals from a small number of projections.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Framework for EEG Compression","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301243","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301243.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing Framework for EEG Compression","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301243/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing Framework for EEG Compression","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045931S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301250,"authors":[{"name":"Mona A.

Recent work in the area of compressed sensing has provided estimates of the performance of certain widely-used sparse signal processing techniques such as basis pursuit and matching pursuit. However, the optimal achievable performance with sparse signal approximation remains unknown. This paper provides bounds on the ability to estimate a sparse signal in noise. Specifically, we show that there is a critical minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is required for reliable detection of the sparsity pattern of the signal. We furthermore relate this critical SNR to the asymptotic mean squared error of the maximum likelihood estimate of a sparse signal in additive Gaussian noise. The critical SNR is a simple function of the problem dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301258","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","startPage":"254","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Distortion Bounds for Sparse Approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Distortion Bounds for Sparse Approximation","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301258/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Distortion Bounds for Sparse Approximation","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058336S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4301259,"authors":[{"name":"Umut Orguner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Umut","lastName":"Orguner","id":"37265640900"},{"name":"Fredrik Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37283417600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301259","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle filters","Estimation error","Kernel","State estimation","Control theory","Signal processing","Cost function","Monte Carlo methods","Delay estimation","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Risk sensitive","particle filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301259","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301259.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk Sensitive Particle Filters for Mitigating Sample Impoverishment","abstract":"Risk-sensitive filters (RSF) put a penalty to higher-order moments of the estimation error compared to conventional filters as the Kalman filter minimizing the mean square error.

In this paper, we show that Toeplitz-structured matrices with entries drawn independently from the same distributions are also sufficient to recover x from y with high probability, and we compare the performance of such matrices with that of fully independent and identically distributed ones. The use of Toeplitz matrices in CS applications has several potential advantages: (i) they require the generation of only O(n) independent random variables; (ii) multiplication with Toeplitz matrices can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transform, resulting in faster acquisition and reconstruction algorithms; and (iii) Toeplitz-structured matrices arise naturally in certain application areas such as system identification.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301266","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","startPage":"294","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toeplitz-Structured Compressed Sensing Matrices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Signal processing","Probability distribution","Sparse matrices","Data compression","Image processing","System identification","Gas insulated transmission lines","Optical computing","Random variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","restricted isometry property","system identification","Toeplitz matrices","underdetermined systems of linear equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toeplitz-Structured Compressed Sensing Matrices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301266/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301266/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toeplitz-Structured Compressed Sensing Matrices","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048346S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301267,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Boufounos","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Boufounos","id":"37297775000"},{"name":"Marco F.

Recent results in compressive sensing show that a sparse or compressible signal can be reconstructed from very few incoherent measurements. Although the sampling and reconstruction process is robust to measurement noise, all current reconstruction methods assume some knowledge of the noise power or the acquired signal to noise ratio. This knowledge is necessary to set algorithmic parameters and stopping conditions. If these parameters are set incorrectly, then the reconstruction algorithms either do not fully reconstruct the acquired signal (underfitting) or try to explain a significant portion of the noise by distorting the reconstructed signal (overfitting). This paper explores this behavior and examines the use of cross validation to determine the stopping conditions for the optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that by designating a small set of measurements as a validation set it is possible to optimize these algorithms and reduce the reconstruction error. Furthermore we explore the trade-off between using the additional measurements for cross validation instead of reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301267","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301267.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Signal Reconstruction from Noisy Compressive Measurements using Cross Validation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301267/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Signal Reconstruction from Noisy Compressive Measurements using Cross Validation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301267/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Signal Reconstruction from Noisy Compressive Measurements using Cross Validation","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052463S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301269,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhou","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37292876100"},{"name":"Patrick Claus Friedrich Eggers","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Patrick Claus Friedrich","lastName":"Eggers","id":"37279555900"},{"name":"Persefoni Kyritsi","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Persefoni","lastName":"Kyritsi","id":"37283924200"},{"name":"Jorgen Bach Andersen","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jorgen Bach","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37280846000"},{"name":"Gert Frolund Pedersen","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Gert Frolund","lastName":"Pedersen","id":"37279565600"},{"name":"Jesper Odum Nilsen","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper Odum","lastName":"Nilsen","id":"38256730000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301269","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301269","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Radio transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Filters","Intelligent networks","Antennas and propagation","Antenna arrays","Wideband","Indoor environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MISO","time reversal","spatial focusing"]}],"abstract":"This paper evaluates the spatial focusing performance of the Time Reversal (TR) method in a multiple input single output (MISO) situation with experimental data.

Increasing interest in cooperative communication has made it of great significance to explore howto utilize, at multiple transmitters, the full multiuser channel state information, which is the collection of the channel state information between each of the users and the base station. Thus, we continue our research on uplink transmit beamforming design for multiple users inMIMO systems, assuming complete cooperation among users such that the full multiuser channel state information is known not only to the receiver but also to all the transmitters. We propose an algorithm for designing optimal beamforming weights in terms of maximizing the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR). Through statistical modelling, we decouple the original mathematically intractable optimization problem and achieved a closed-form solution. As in our previous work, the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver with ordered successive interference cancellation (SIC) is adopted for multiuser detection. The proposed scheme is compared with the jointly optimized transceiver design and our previously proposed eigen-beamforming algorithm. Simulation results demonsrate that our algorithm, with much less computational burden than the jointly optimized approach, accomplishes either almost the same or even better performance than the jointly optimized transceiver for various MIMO channels, and always works better than our previously proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301290.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Transmit Beamforming Design for SINR Maximization in Cooperative MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Transmitters","Multiuser channels","Algorithm design and analysis","Transceivers","Channel state information","Base stations","Signal design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","MIMO","SINR maximization","multiuser","uplink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Transmit Beamforming Design for SINR Maximization in Cooperative MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Transmit Beamforming Design for SINR Maximization in Cooperative MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049679S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4301291,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Qian","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Qian","id":"38258317600"},{"name":"Chunming Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287525300"},{"name":"G.

SAR transmits chirp signals and the received echoes are sampled into In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) components, generally referred to as raw SAR data. The various modes of SAR coupled with the high resolution and wide swath requirements result in a huge amount of data, which will easily exceed the on-board storage and downlink bandwidth of a satellite. This paper addresses the compression of the raw SAR data by sampling the signal below Nyquist rate using ideas from Compressed Sensing (CS). Due to the low computational resources available onboard satellite, the idea is to use a simple encoder, with a 2D FFT and a random sampler. Decoding is then based on convex optimization or uses greedy algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Encoding of Synthetic Aperture Radar Raw Data using Compressed Sensing","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301298","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301298.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast Encoding of Synthetic Aperture Radar Raw Data using Compressed Sensing","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301298/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Encoding of Synthetic Aperture Radar Raw Data using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039966S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301302,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292963000"},{"name":"Rick S.

MIMO radar offers the potential for significant gains, e.g., diversity gain and spatial resolution gain. Since the employed radar waveform plays a key role in determining the accuracy, resolution, and ambiguity in performing tasks such as determining the target range, velocity, shape and so on, it is meaningful to investigate waveform design specially for this newly proposed MIMO radar. This paper summarizes some of our recent results on MIMO radar waveform design, mainly for identification and classification of extended radar targets. Our waveform design considers optimizing two criteria: maximization of the mutual information (MI) and minimization of the minimum mean-square error (MMSE). In this process, we are also interested in identifying the relationship between the waveforms obtained under the two criteria, given different a prior knowledge of the target's second-order statistics.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301302","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","startPage":"468","endPage":"472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radarwaveform Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radarwaveform Design","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301302/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301302/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radarwaveform Design","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047869S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4301303,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843500"},{"name":"Xumin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xumin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536985800"},{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37289980700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301303","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":289},"abstract":"Transmit beampattern design is a critically important task in many fields including defense and homeland security as well as biomedical applications. Flexible transmit beampattern designs can be achieved by exploiting the waveform diversity offered by an array of sensors that transmit probing signals chosen at will. Recently proposed techniques for waveform diversity-based transmit beampattern design have focused on the optimization of the covariance matrix R of the waveforms, as optimizing a performance metric directly with respect to the waveform matrix is a more complicated operation. Given an R, the problem becomes that of determining a signal waveform matrix X whose covariance matrix is equal or close to R, and which also satisfies some practically motivated constraints. We propose a cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of such an X, which (approximately) realizes a given optimal covariance matrix R under various practical constraints. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301303.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Synthesis for Diversity-Based Transmit Beampattern Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Signal design","Sensor arrays","Signal synthesis","Design optimization","Constraint optimization","Biomedical measurements","Terrorism","Biosensors","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Synthesis for Diversity-Based Transmit Beampattern Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Synthesis for Diversity-Based Transmit Beampattern Design","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054276S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301304,"authors":[{"name":"D.

As a consequence, careful time-slot or frequency-reuse planning is required. This has adverse network data-rate and latency implications. The focus of this paper is a demonstration of signal processing techniques that enable simultaneous transmission and reception. These techniques employ informed-transmittermultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links. A combination of adaptive transmit and receive antenna array approaches is exploited. A number of important types of networking limitations can be resolved given simultaneous transmit and receive technology. The first example is the simultaneous link problem. By employing transmit and receive spatial adaptivity, two links can operate in close proximity using the same frequency at the same time. Another example is the full duplex relay node. Using the same frequency for both links, a given node can simultaneously receive packets from one node while forwarding them to another. For practical systems, two issues dominate performance: channel estimation error, often caused by stale estimates of the channel at the transmitter, and dynamic range limitations of the transmitter and receiver. These issues are investigated. Theoretical, simulated, and experimental results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301304","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301304.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Transmission and Reception for Improved Wireless Network Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301304/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Transmission and Reception for Improved Wireless Network Performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301304/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Transmission and Reception for Improved Wireless Network Performance","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078638S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4301307,"authors":[{"name":"Yangyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814400"},{"name":"Chunlin Ji","affiliation":["Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences, Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Chunlin","lastName":"Ji","id":"37533522500"},{"name":"Wasim Q.

This paper is motivated by the need to account for challenging constraints that naturally arise in such applications such as channel model uncertainties and demanding sensitivity constraints of the sensing devices. We propose a False Discovery Rate (FDR) based cooperative strategy to sense the occupancy of the spectrum. The proposed strategy is robust to significant uncertainties such as lack of CSI, fading and shadowing effects.

The contribution of the signal subspace to the perturbation of the singular vectors that span the signal subspace is often ignored as it is treated as second and higher order terms, and thus the first-order perturbation is typically given as the column span of the noise subspace. In this paper, we show that not only the noise subspace, but also the signal subspace, contribute to the first-order perturbation of the singular vectors. We further show that the contribution of the signal subspace does not impact on the performance analysis of algorithms that rely on the signal subspace for parameter estimation, but it affects the analysis of algorithms that depends on the individual basis vectors. For the latter, we also give a condition under which the contribution of the signal subspace to the perturbation of singular vectors may be ignored in the statistical sense.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301315","startPage":"532","endPage":"536","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First-Order Perturbation Analysis of Singular Vectors in Singular Value Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"First-Order Perturbation Analysis of Singular Vectors in Singular Value Decomposition","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301315/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301315/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First-Order Perturbation Analysis of Singular Vectors in Singular Value Decomposition","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092555S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4301317,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Recently, the Robust Capon Beamformer (RCB) is derived which utilizes the uncertainty set of the desired array steering vector and is capable of handling arbitrary array steering vector mismatches. However, when large steering vector mismatches occur, the uncertainty set has to be expanded to accommodate for the increased uncertainty and this degrades the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the RCB. In this paper, an iterative RCB is proposed which makes use of a small uncertainty sphere to search for the desired array steering vector. This proposed method provides higher SINR than the conventional RCB by avoiding the use of a large uncertainty search sphere. Unlike the conventional RCB, this iterative RCB does not require knowledge of the uncertainty level in the desired array steering vector. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","startPage":"542","endPage":"545","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301317.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Robust Capon Beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301317/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Robust Capon Beamformer","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Robust Capon Beamformer","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050266S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301318,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Ichige","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ichige","id":"37284348300"},{"name":"Mitsuharu Imai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuharu","lastName":"Imai","id":"37710752900"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Arai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Arai","id":"37274910900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301318","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Surveillance","Independent component analysis","Digital modulation","Signal processing","Array signal processing","Signal analysis","Source separation","Computational efficiency","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Direction of arrival estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient blind signal separation scheme for radio surveillance of digital modulation signals using Fast-ICA algorithm.

We propose a distributed algorithm in which the nodes utilize probabilistically quantized information to communicate with each other. The algorithm we develop is a dynamical system that generates sequences achieving a consensus, which is one of the quantization values. In addition, we show that the expected value of the consensus is equal to the average of the original sensor data. We report the results of simulations conducted to evaluate the behavior and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301337.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Average Consensus using Probabilistic Quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Additive noise","Distributed computing","Bandwidth","Computer networks","Distributed algorithms","Computational modeling","Application software","Power engineering computing","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed algorithms","average consensus","sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Average Consensus using Probabilistic Quantization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Average Consensus using Probabilistic Quantization","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048746S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301346,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Teng","affiliation":["ICD-LM2S, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Teng","id":"37402307900"},{"name":"Hichem Snoussi","affiliation":["ICD-LM2S, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Hichem","lastName":"Snoussi","id":"37297002600"},{"name":"Cedric Richard","affiliation":["ICD-LM2S, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France"],"firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Richard","id":"37284386900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Filtering algorithms","Particle filters","Robustness","Trajectory","Particle tracking","Intelligent networks","Electronic mail","Uniform resource locators"]}],"abstract":"Target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSN) has brought up new practical problems.

The variational formulation allows an implicit compression of the exchanged statistics between leader nodes, enabling thus a distributed decision-making.

Inspired by applications in sensor networks in which each sensor is likely to observe a noisy version of a sparse signal and subsequently add sampling error through computation and communication, we investigate how the distortion differs depending on whether noise is introduced before sampling (observation error) or after sampling (sampling error). We analyze the optimal linear estimator (for known support) and an l1 constrained linear inverse (for unknown support). In both cases, observation noise is shown to be less detrimental than sampling noise and low sampling rates. We also provide sampling bounds for a non-stochastic l\u221e bounded noise model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Signal reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Signal sampling","Computer networks","Distortion","Computer errors","Intelligent networks","Application software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","random matrices","sparsity","sensor networks","l1-minimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301347","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301347.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differences Between Observation and Sampling Error in Sparse Signal Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differences Between Observation and Sampling Error in Sparse Signal Reconstruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301347/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301347/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differences Between Observation and Sampling Error in Sparse Signal Reconstruction","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07841S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4301360,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Windisch","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Windisch","id":"37418552700"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1197-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1198-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"4301360","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Kalman filters","Receivers","Radio frequency","Digital signal processing","Frequency estimation","Hardware","Parameter estimation","RF signals","Source separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["I/Q imbalance","direct-conversion","OFDM","digital compensation","blind estimation","Kalman filter"]}],"abstract":"I/Q imbalance has been identified as one of the key challenges in the practical implementation of the direct-conversion receiver architecture. This holds in particular at the reception of multi-carrier signals, such as OFDM. While allowing highly integrated and low-cost solutions, direct-conversionmay cause serious signal distortions due to an imbalanced I/Q down-conversion. This paper shows how blind, i.e. non reference-based, signal processing techniques can be applied for a digital estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance. Further enhancements of the blind estimator can be achieved through the application of Kalman filtering, including tracking and compensation of time-varying and frequency-selective I/Q imbalance.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2007.4301360","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301199/4301200/04301360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2007.4301360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301200","startPage":"754","endPage":"758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Estimation and Compensation of I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Receivers with Enhancements Through Kalman Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Estimation and Compensation of I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Receivers with Enhancements Through Kalman Filtering","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301360/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4301360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Estimation and Compensation of I/Q Imbalance in OFDM Receivers with Enhancements Through Kalman Filtering","confLoc":"Madison, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SSP-00-160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16986S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301199","isNumber":"4301200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301199","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4301200","articleId":"4301360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4301389,"authors":[{"name":"Chad Holbrook","affiliation":["Department of ECECS, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Holbrook","id":"37714238200"},{"name":"Ping Chen","affiliation":["Department of ECECS, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716695600"},{"name":"D.

With those equations, we can answer for the practical questions that arise in actual network operations; what sampling rate to set in order to find the given volume of anomaly, or, if the sampling is too high for actual operation, then what granularity is optimal to find the anomaly for a given lower limit of sampling rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Global Internet Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4301417/4301418/04301426.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Global Internet Symposium","doi":"10.1109/GI.2007.4301426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GI.2007.4301426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4301418","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4301426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of sampling rate and monitoring granularity on anomaly detectability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Monitoring","Telecommunication traffic","Statistics","Equations","IP networks","Web and internet services","Informatics","Computer crime","Packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["granularity monitoring","sampling rate effect","anomaly detectability","anomalous traffic","false positive ratio","false negative ratio","optimal granularity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4301426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-11 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effect of sampling rate and monitoring granularity on anomaly detectability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4301426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10286570","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"11-11 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of sampling rate and monitoring granularity on anomaly detectability","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"GI-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050006S","chronDate":"11-11 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4301417","isNumber":"4301418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4301417","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4301418","articleId":"4301426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4301427,"authors":[{"name":"Tilman Wolf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tilman","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37281966000"},{"name":"Yan Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Cai","id":"37402901200"},{"name":"Patrick Kelly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Kelly","id":"37300637900"},{"name":"Weibo Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Weibo","lastName":"Gong","id":"37327806100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1697-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4301427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"The increasing complexity of the Internet demands continued improvements to measurement techniques and data analysis methods to aid our understanding of network operation.

By noted that there is no obvious distribution assumption can model underwater noise, an empirical model of noise constructed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to identify the signals. This DWT based model adapts with time and is treated as a baseline at any time to detect the signals. Though, the DWT has a high reputation as a tool for signal compression, due to lack of shift invariance, it has major variations in the distribution of energy between DWT coefficients in different subbands. For detection applications, the ill effects of translation need to be neutralized because the test statistic depends on the energy of signals. This paper proposes the use of a dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DT DWT) to the problem of signal detection in underwater sound. This shift-invariant DT DWT can generate multi-resolution subspaces that keep more of their coefficient energy in each of these subspaces than discrete wavelet transform's (DWT). The detection performance comparison, using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, of this proposed DT DWT-based detector and DWT-based method is presented.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302197","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302197.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Detection in Underwater Sound by Dual-Tree Discrete Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302197/","displayDocTitle":"Signal Detection in Underwater Sound by Dual-Tree Discrete Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9796254","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302197/","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Detection in Underwater Sound by Dual-Tree Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092617S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302221,"authors":[{"name":"Roee Diamant","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Roee","lastName":"Diamant","id":"37540379200"},{"name":"Arie Feuer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Arie","lastName":"Feuer","id":"37294156800"},{"name":"Amos A.

Our work shows that by using the Time Reversal (TR) technique, the channel capacity is achieved without the requirement for Channel State Information (CSI). A very shallow underwater sea trial was conducted. The results confirmed the validity of our analysis. It demonstrated that the 2X2 TR MIMO channel capacity is roughly 2 times larger than the non TR SISO channel capacity and is equivalent to the optimal MIMO system performances.

In this case, placing cameras on one set of vehicles and lights on another set can surmount the traditional limitations to single vehicle imaging. As envisioned, the arbitrary location of these vehicles in 3-dimensional space permits the arbitrary placement of cameras and lights. One advantage over traditional, single vehicle implementations is that the locations of the cameras and the lights can be dynamically configured in order to optimize imaging system performance. Highly scattering environments might by optimized by one set of camera light configurations whereas low scattering and low absorption environments might benefit from alternate configurations. In addition. 3-dimensional measurement of the sea floor can be facilitated via various configurations that will support either structured light imaging or stereo imaging. We conclude that Multiple AUV Optical Imaging presents new options for improving the performance of underwater optical imaging system.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302223","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302223.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Optical Imaging for Extended Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Optical imaging","Cameras","Remotely operated vehicles","Optical scattering","Light scattering","Space vehicles","System performance","Absorption","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","lighting","oceanographic equipment","optical images","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicle","underwater optical imaging systems","underwater camera","underwater lighting","camera-lighting configuration","structured light imaging","stereo imaging","multiple AUV optical imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image generation","Underwater optical imaging","Autonomous underwater vehicles","AUVs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Optical Imaging for Extended Performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302223/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9796276","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Optical Imaging for Extended Performance","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038121S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4302238,"authors":[{"name":"Martina Daun","affiliation":["Research Establishment for Applied Sciences (FGAN), Research Institute for Communication, Information Processing, and Ergonomics, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Daun","id":"37547454500"},{"name":"Wolfgang Koch","affiliation":["Research Establishment for Applied Sciences (FGAN), Research Institute for Communication, Information Processing, and Ergonomics, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Koch","id":"38262259600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4302238","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"abstract":"Digital Audio/Video Broadcasting (DAB/DVB-T) [1] is already available in a large area. The advantage of using these signals for passive air surveillance is the disposability of a large range of illuminators sending an easily decodeable digital broadcast signal. In the considered multi-static scenario, one observer provides bistatic Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Doppler measurements. To build a 3D multi-target tracker, information of different illuminators has to be fused. The main task is to handle ghosts, which arise due to the association problems between illuminators, targets and measurements. For real-time applications the runtime of the algorithm is another important issue. As a solution, we present a Multi Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) filter working on different stages. The first stage includes a primary tracking directly on the measurements; the second stage works on 2D-estimates and addresses the association problem; the final stage yields 3D information. Numerical results will include performance analysis via Monte-Carlo simulations and comparison to the trace of the covariance matrix. Estimation errors in the x/y-plane and height will be considered separately.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302238.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistatic Target Tracking for Non-Cooperative Illuminating by DAB/DVB-T","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Digital video broadcasting","Digital audio broadcasting","Surveillance","Decoding","Time difference of arrival","Doppler measurements","Runtime","Filters","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital audio broadcasting","digital video broadcasting","geophysical techniques","Monte Carlo methods","radar tracking","surveillance","target tracking","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D multistatic target tracking","noncooperative illuminating","DAB/DVB-T","digital audio/video broadcasting","passive air surveillance","time difference of arrival","Doppler measurements","multi hypothesis tracking filter","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DAB","DVB-T","Multistatic Radar","Deghosting","MHT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multistatic Target Tracking for Non-Cooperative Illuminating by DAB/DVB-T","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302238/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9796288","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistatic Target Tracking for Non-Cooperative Illuminating by DAB/DVB-T","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050825S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302299,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Courmontagne","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137 Maison des Technologies, I.S.E.N, Toulon, France","L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, ISEN Toulon Maison des Technologies, Toulon"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Courmontagne","id":"37563316000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4302299","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302299","abstract":"SAS (Synthetic Aperture Sonar) has been used in sea bed imagery. Indeed, high resolution images provided by SAS are of great interest, especially for the detection, localization or eventually classification of objects lying on sea bed. But, SAS images are highly corrupted by a granular multiplicative noise, called speckle noise, which reduces spatial and radiometric resolutions. For this reason, an automatic analysis of these images is not so evident. A solution can consist on the use of a filtering before process, without a spatial resolution degradation. The purpose of this article is to present a new process consisting on the jointly use of the stochastic matched filter and an autoadaptive mean filter. Furthermore, in order to well preserve the spatial resolution, we propose to use as a criterion for the stochastic matched filter the minimization between the speckle noise local statistics with the removal signal ones, allowing a subimage size adaptation. Results obtained on real SAS data are proposed and compared with those obtained using another stochastic matched filtering based denoising method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Synthetic aperture sonar","Image denoising","Stochastic processes","Stochastic resonance","Spatial resolution","Noise reduction","Image resolution","Speckle","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","image denoising","speckle","synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAS image denoising","autoadaptive mean filter","stochastic matched filter","synthetic aperture sonar","speckle noise"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302299","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302299.pdf","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAS images denoising: the jointly use of an autoadaptive mean filter and the stochastic matched filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SAS images denoising: the jointly use of an autoadaptive mean filter and the stochastic matched filter","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9811396","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302299/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAS images denoising: the jointly use of an autoadaptive mean filter and the stochastic matched filter","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063674S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4302311,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Courmontagne","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, ISEN Toulon, Maison des Technologies, Toulon, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Courmontagne","id":"37563316000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4302311","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Matched filters","Noise reduction","Synthetic aperture sonar","Speckle","Sonar detection","Underwater tracking","Radiometry","Spatial resolution","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo","geophysical signal processing","image classification","image denoising","matched filters","object detection","oceanographic techniques","sonar detection","sonar imaging","sonar target recognition","stochastic processes","synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic matched filter","image denoising","SAS image despeckling","underwater mine detection","underwater mine classification","synthetic aperture sonar","mine echoes","mine shadows","speckle noise","spatial resolution","radiometric resolution","SAS image analysis"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review on Stochastic Matched Filter based denoising methods for SAS images despeckling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302311","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302311","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","abstract":"Detection and classification of underwater mines with synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images is a challenge that can be performed in studying either the echoes or the shadows of mines. But, as any images obtained with a coherent system, SAS images are highly corrupted by the speckle noise, which reduces spatial and radiometric resolutions. So such a noise can be very disturbing for the interpretation and the automatic analysis of SAS images. To reduce the speckle level, filtering methods are generally used but all of them strongly deteriorate either the shadow or the echo of the mine. The purpose of this article is to compare several stochastic matched filter based denoising methods, in order to determine which of them is the most appropriate to enhance both echoes and shadow mines.

The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for increasing the transmission data rate. However, this requires accurate channel estimation; this can be achieved by using pilot signals superimposed with the data signals. Space-time processing of signals received by an antenna array allows reducing the intersymbol interference (ISI) due to multipath propagation. Several space-time processing techniques are investigated in application to OFDM signals transmitted by a fast moving omnidirectional transducer. A linear vertical antenna array of omnidirectional elements is used for receiving the signals. Three direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation techniques are considered. The techniques use signal interpolation, Capon beamforming, and the superimposed pilot signal. The DoA estimates are used for angle-separation of signals by applying a modified Capon beamforming. After time synchronisation, Doppler compensation, and channel estimation, a frequency-domain linear equaliser is applied to signals selected according to the DoA information. The equalised OFDM signals from different directions are linearly combined, and an adaptive Doppler filter (ADF) is used in the frequency domain for removing a residual I CI. An experimental trial has been carried out in the Pacific Ocean at a distance of 30 km. The transmission data rates were 0.5 bit/s/Hz and 1 bit/s/Hz; the results obtained show that for these scenarios, the uncoded OFDM transmission can provide the bit-error-rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n and 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time signal processing of OFDM signals in fast-varying underwater acoustic channel","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302328","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302328.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Space-time signal processing of OFDM signals in fast-varying underwater acoustic channel","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302328/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9811401","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time signal processing of OFDM signals in fast-varying underwater acoustic channel","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056564S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302341,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Y.M.

In this paper, we propose an energy efficient protocol for such delay tolerant data retrieval applications. This protocol can be optimized to reduce retrieval time and energy consumption and is highly customizable to suit various network sizes and application requirements. It adopts efficient erasure codes (LT codes) and forward error correction codes (LDPC codes) to overcome the challenges in an underwater acoustic environment, such as large and variable propagation delay, low and narrow bandwidth and limited energy resources.

To this aim, we organize the network in clusters and give details on which access scheme (both for the clusterheads and for the children nodes) gives better results under a number of performance metrics, highlighting the different protocol behaviors in the scenarios of interest and translating the relevant tradeoffs into design criteria.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302364.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Multiple Access Techniques in Clustered Underwater Acoustic Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Multiple Access Techniques in Clustered Underwater Acoustic Networks","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302364/","accessionNumber":"9796377","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302364/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Multiple Access Techniques in Clustered Underwater Acoustic Networks","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048115S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4302384,"authors":[{"name":"Hailiang Yang","affiliation":["Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Hailiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37536319600"},{"name":"Jinsong Tang","affiliation":["Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37290460200"},{"name":"Qihu Li","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qihu","lastName":"Li","id":"37349283500"},{"name":"Xiaodong Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4302384","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Image sampling","Synthetic aperture sonar","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Transmitters","Acoustic pulses","Sampling methods","Reconstruction algorithms","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","sonar imaging","synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform azimuth sampling","multiple-receiver synthetic aperture sonar image","SAS imaging","displaced phase center technique","phase error","pulse repetition frequency","antenna length","pulse repetition interval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-receiver synthetic aperture sonar","displaced Phase Center","\"stop and hop\" approximation","non-uniform sampling","image reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302384","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302384.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing of non-uniform azimuth sampling in multiple-receiver Synthetic aperture sonar image","abstract":"Multiple-receiver synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imaging with Displaced Phase Center (DPC) technique can solve the confliction between mapping speed and resolution, but this mode brings some phase error and restricts the selection of velocity of the SAS carrier and the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), namely, the SAS carrier velocity has to be chosen such that the SAS carrier moves just one half of its antenna length in a pulse repetition interval.

We present an adaptive location-based routing protocol, called hop-by-hop vector-based forwarding (HH-VBF). It uses the notion of a \"routing vector\" (a vector from the source to the sink) acting as the axis of the \"routing pipe\", similar to the vector based forward (VBF) routing in the work of P. Xie, J.-H. Cui and L. Lao (VBF: Vector-Based Forwarding Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks. Technical report, UCONN CSE Technical Report: UbiNet-TR05-03 (BECAT/CSE-TR-05-6), Feb. 2005). Unlike the original VBF approach, however, HH-VBF suggests the use of a routing vector for each individual forwarder in the network, instead of a single network-wide source-to-sink routing vector. By the creation of the hop-by-hop vectors, HH-VBF can overcome two major problems in VBF: (1) too small data delivery ratio for sparse networks; (2) too sensitive to \"routing pipe\" radius threshold. We conduct simulations to evaluate HH-VBF, and the results show that HH-VBF yields much better performance than VBF in sparse networks. In addition, HH-VBF is less sensitive to the routing pipe radius threshold. Furthermore, we also analyze the behavior of HH-VBF and show that assuming proper redundancy and feedback techniques, HH-VBF can facilitate the avoidance of any \"void\" areas in the network.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302470","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Robustness of Location-Based Routing for Underwater Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Robustness of Location-Based Routing for Underwater Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302470/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9796463","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302470/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Robustness of Location-Based Routing for Underwater Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041269S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4302471,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, North Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenhai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37695150300"},{"name":"C.

The Meijer G function is used to simplify the derivation of the Natural Gradient (NG) algorithm for updating the weight matrix of the unmixing neural network.

OFDM transmissions over UWA channels encounter frequency-dependent Doppler drifts that destroy the orthogonality among OFDM subcarriers. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to mitigating the frequency-dependent Doppler drifts in zero-padded OFDM transmissions over fast-varying channels: (1) non-uniform Doppler compensation via resampling that converts a \"wideband\" problem into a \"narrowband\" problem; and (2) high-resolution uniform compensation on the residual Doppler. Based on block-by-block processing, our receiver does not rely on channel dependence across OFDM blocks, and is thus desirable for fast-varying UWA channels. We test our receiver with data from a shallow water experiment at Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. Our receiver achieves excellent performance even when the transmitter and the receivers have a relative speed up to 10 knots, where the Doppler drifts are several times larger than the OFDM subcarrier spacing.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","pdfPath":"/iel5/4302188/4302189/04302478.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007 - Europe","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Uniform Doppler Compensation for Zero-Padded OFDM over Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Underwater acoustics","Receivers","Wideband","Underwater communication","Bandwidth","Frequency conversion","Narrowband","Radio transmitters","Marine technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","oceanographic techniques","OFDM modulation","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform Doppler compensation","underwater acoustic channels","UWA channels","frequency-dependent Doppler drifts","two-step approach","zero-padded OFDM transmissions","narrowband problem","block-by-block processing","shallow water experiment","Buzzards Bay","Massachusetts","transmitter","receivers","relative speed","OFDM subcarrier spacing","signal bandwidth","wideband problem conversion","high-resolution uniform compensation","residual Doppler"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Non-Uniform Doppler Compensation for Zero-Padded OFDM over Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9796469","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Uniform Doppler Compensation for Zero-Padded OFDM over Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"OCEANSE-00-289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112122S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4302188","isNumber":"4302189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4302188","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4302189","articleId":"4302478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302506,"authors":[{"name":"Justinian Anatory","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Systems, University of Dares Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4302501/4302506/4302506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Justinian Anatory (S'06) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He was a Software and IT Engineer with Beta Communication Consulting Co., Ltd., Dar es Salaam, before again joining the University of Dar es salaam in 2001.

The developed methodology starts with a selected number of switches which generate various topologies. Load flows are then performed to evaluate the feasibility of topologies. For each feasible topology, fault analysis is performed to first calculate voltage sags at different buses in the network and then to calculate financial losses incurred by voltage sags at buses with sensitive industrial processes. The result of the optimization is the topology which yields the lowest voltage sag cost to customers. The main features of the GA include double-point crossover and adaptive mutation.

As a consequence, in some cases, the load currents may approach the value of the fault currents for faults located far from the supply stations. The detection of the faults in such a situation has become difficult for the electromechanical protections at present in operation in Italy in the lines above. In addition, transient phenomena related to the train absorption, frequently cause untimely trippings of the protections above. For such a reason, in the years 1999-2000, a field test campaign was performed in the 3-kVdc lines Campoleone-Cisterna and Farneta-Montallese in Italy, in order to investigate the phenomena that lead to the untimely trippings above. On the basis of the field test campaign, it was found that such an inconvenience is related to the inner characteristics of the electromechanical protections in use. A digital protection, operating on new protective algorithms, was thus set up and thereafter put in operation in the years 2003-2004. This paper presents the basic principles of the new protection above and the results of the first two years of operation.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.898585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4302501/04302513.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.898585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New High-Speed Digital Relay Protection of the 3-kVdc Electric Railway Lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302513/","displayDocTitle":"A New High-Speed Digital Relay Protection of the 3-kVdc Electric Railway Lines","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302513/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9633510","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New High-Speed Digital Relay Protection of the 3-kVdc Electric Railway Lines","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd04-cinieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03465S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4302501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4302501","articleId":"4302513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302515,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Cunill-Sola","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Manresa, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4302501/4302515/4302515-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jordi Cunill-Sol\u00e0 was born in Sant Juli\u00e0 de Cerdanyola, Spain, in 1962.

This type of light bulb is used increasingly because its energy consumption is low, especially compared to traditional incandescent bulbs, and because its average useful life is longer. However, disadvantages also exist in that these bulbs are linear and time-variant electrical loads, and the current waveform they absorb is extremely distorted (far removed from the sinusoidal form). This gives rise to harmonic current injections on the electrical grid, which causes problems in installations and have a negative impact on voltage waveform quality. Due to the disadvantages just presented and other factors, it is important to study current waveforms in diverse scenarios and different electrical power that is involved in addition to the active power, such as the reactive power, apparent power, and distortion powers (as defined in IEEE Std. 1459-2000). Other concepts, such as the harmonic distortion percentage, are also examined. With these aims in mind, we set out to create models for and simulate the behavior of these lamps using Pspice, the well-known simulation program.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Fluorescent lamps","Electronic ballasts","Reactive power","Harmonic distortion","Power system harmonics","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Electronic circuits","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluorescent lamps","harmonic distortion","lamp accessories","power consumption","reactive power","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-watt compact fluorescent lamps","electronic ballasts","energy-efficient light bulbs","energy consumption","linear electrical loads","time-variant electrical loads","current waveform","harmonic current injections","electrical grid","voltage waveform quality","active power","reactive power","apparent power","distortion powers","harmonic distortion","Pspice"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)","harmonics","linear time-variant (LTV) load","power quality","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4302501/04302515.pdf","startPage":"2305","endPage":"2311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study and Characterization of Waveforms From Low-Watt (-25 W) Compact Fluorescent Lamps With Electronic Ballasts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study and Characterization of Waveforms From Low-Watt (<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\u226a$</tex></formula>25 W) Compact Fluorescent Lamps With Electronic Ballasts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302515/","volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302515/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9883646","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study and Characterization of Waveforms From Low-Watt (<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\u226a$</tex></formula>25 W) Compact Fluorescent Lamps With Electronic Ballasts","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd04-cunillsola.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062194S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4302501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4302501","articleId":"4302515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":4302521,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Kumar Gajbhiye","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India"],"bio":{"p":["Rajeev Kumar Gajbhiye (S'05) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India.","His research interests include large-scale power system analysis, power system protection, and deregulation."]},"firstName":"Rajeev Kumar","lastName":"Gajbhiye","id":"37402680800"},{"name":"Anindya De","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"p":["Anindya De is currently pursuing the B.Tech degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India."]},"firstName":"Anindya","lastName":"De","id":"38245221900"},{"name":"S.

The network reconfiguration algorithm is based on the fuzzy multiobjective approach and the max-min principle is adopted for the multiobjective optimization in a fuzzy framework. Multiple objectives are considered for real-power loss reduction in which nodes voltage deviation is kept within a range, and an absolute value of branch currents is not allowed to exceed their rated capacities. At the same time, a radial network structure is maintained with all loads energized. The three objectives considered are modeled with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature and one can provide his or her anticipated value of each objective.

A horizontally configured line was tested in 2000, and a vertically configured line in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The horizontally and vertically configured lines were equipped with six and four arrester stations, respectively, and, additionally, in 2003, the vertical line with a pole-mounted transformer. During the 2000, 2001, and 2002 experiments, arresters were frequently rendered inoperable by disconnector operation during triggered lightning strokes, but there was no disconnector operation during the 2003 experiment when the transformer was on the line. In all four years, there were commonly flashovers from the struck phase-conductor to the closest phase-conductor not subjected to direct lightning current injection. The self-consistency of measurements is assessed via comparison of the injected lightning current with: 1) the total current flowing to Earth through the multiple line groundings and 2) the total phase-to-neutral current flowing through the line arresters and line terminations. This paper is part one of two related papers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4302501/04302554.pdf","startPage":"2236","endPage":"2244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.905378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.905378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Lightning Strikes to Test Power Distribution Lines\u2014Part I: Experiment and Overall Results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Testing","Power distribution","Arresters","Power transformers","Flashover","Protection","Power distribution lines","Current measurement","Grounding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arresters","lightning protection","power distribution faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct lightning strikes","power distribution lines testing","rocket-triggered lightning","unenergized power distribution lines","International Center for Lightning Research and Testing","Florida","injected lightning current","grounding electrodes","lightning arresters","power transformers","horizontally configured line","vertically configured line","pole-mounted transformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arresters","grounding electrodes","lightning","power distribution lines","power transformers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Direct Lightning Strikes to Test Power Distribution Lines\u2014Part I: Experiment and Overall Results","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4302554/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633554","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Lightning Strikes to Test Power Distribution Lines\u2014Part I: Experiment and Overall Results","sourcePdf":"22tpwrd04-schoene.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119152S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4302501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4302501","articleId":"4302554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302556,"authors":[{"name":"K.

BI is currently the top-most priority of many chief information officers. BI has become a strategic initiative and is now recognized by CIOs and business leaders as instrumental in driving business effectiveness and innovation. BI is a process that includes two primary activities: getting data in and getting data out. Getting data in, traditionally referred to as data warehousing, involves moving data from a set of source systems into an integrated data warehouse. Getting data in delivers limited value to an enterprise; only when users and applications access the data and use it to make decisions does the organization realize the full value from its data warehouse. Thus, getting data out receives most attention from organizations. This second activity, which is commonly referred to as BI, consists of business users and applications accessing data from the data warehouse to perform enterprise reporting, OLAP, querying, and predictive analytics.","doi":"10.1109/MC.2007.331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2007.331","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/4302594/04302625.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Current State of Business Intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Current State of Business Intelligence","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9623818","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302625/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Current State of Business Intelligence","sourcePdf":"r9096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059205S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"4302594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4302594","articleId":"4302625","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4302627,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Kohavi","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"bio":{"p":["Ron Kohavi is the general manager of Microsoft's Experimentation Platform"]},"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Kohavi","id":"37352665800"},{"name":"Roger Longbotham","affiliation":["Microsoft"],"bio":{"p":["Roger Longbotham is the team's lead statistician.

The simplest experiments randomly assign live users to one of two variants: the control, which is commonly the existing version, and the treatment, which is usually a new version being evaluated. The overall evaluation criterion can be a simple metric that summarizes important business goals or a weighted combination of metrics, as is often used in credit scores. Randomization is too important to be left to chance. A common way to maintain user experience consistency is to employ a hashing function on a user ID stored in a cookie. Cryptographic hashes such as MD5 are generally the best. Failure to randomize properly can confound results when running multiple tests simultaneously. The other common mistakes in online experiments are launching a feature that is statistically significantly different but has little business value and launching a feature because it doesn't negatively impact users. Online experiments, whether they fail or succeed, generate insights that can bring a quick return on investment and promote innovation.","doi":"10.1109/MC.2007.328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2007.328","startPage":"103","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/4302594/04302627.pdf","publicationTitle":"Computer","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Experiments: Lessons Learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Online Experiments: Lessons Learned","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302627/","accessionNumber":"9692074","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302627/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Experiments: Lessons Learned","sourcePdf":"r9103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032833S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"4302594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4302594","articleId":"4302627","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4302645,"authors":[{"name":"Wing C.

In order to maximize the link throughput, frame sizes of the link layer are dynamically and optimally tuned based on this iBER estimates. Next, we implement an opportunistic channel access scheme in the context of IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN superframe structure. In this method, individual links' time allocations are determined proportionally with respect to their link efficiencies.

Conversion requires a relatively small area and can afford fast operation. The BD conversion moreover allows an easy alignment of the sums of adjacent columns. We treat the design of BCD digit adders using fast carry-free adders and the conversion problem through a known parallel scheme using elementary conversion cells.

Many scientific operations such as matrix-vector multiplication and dot product involve the reduction of a sequentially produced stream of values. Unfortunately, because of the pipelining in FPGA-based floating-point units, data hazards may occur during these sequential reduction operations. Improperly designed reduction circuits can adversely impact the performance, impose unrealistic buffer requirements, and consume a significant portion of the FPGA. In this paper, we identify two basic methods for designing serial reduction circuits: the tree-traversal method and the striding method. Using accumulation as an example, we analyze the design trade-offs among the number of adders, buffer size, and latency. We then propose high-performance and area-efficient designs using each method. The proposed designs reduce multiple sets of sequentially delivered floating-point values without stalling the pipeline or imposing unrealistic buffer requirements. Using a Xilinx Virtex-ll Pro FPGA as the target device, we implemented our designs and present performance and area results.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4302721/04302726.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Reduction Circuits Using Deeply Pipelined Operators on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302726/","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Reduction Circuits Using Deeply Pipelined Operators on FPGAs","volume":"18","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302726/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9686308","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Reduction Circuits Using Deeply Pipelined Operators on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"l1377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075677S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4302721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4302721","articleId":"4302726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302732,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4302721/4302732/4302732-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Lian received the BS degree in computer science from Inner Mongolia University, China, in 1992, the MA degree from the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, in 1998, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2006.

We call these historical data a time series of value distributions or snapshots. Obviously, to build the time series snapshots by requiring all of the sensors to transmit their data to the sink periodically is not energy efficient. In this paper, we introduce the idea of gradient boundary and propose the gradient boundary detection (GBD) algorithm to construct these time series snapshots of a monitored region. In GBD, a monitored region is partitioned into a set of subregions and all sensed data in one subregion are within a predefined value range, namely, the gradient interval. Sensors located on the boundaries of the subregions are required to transmit the data to the sink and, then, the sink recovers all subregions to construct snapshots of the monitored area. In this process, only the boundary sensors transmit their data and, therefore, energy consumption is greatly reduced. The simulation results show that GBD is able to build snapshots with a comparable accuracy and has up to 40 percent energy savings compared with the existing approaches for large gradient intervals.","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4302721/04302732.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1057","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1057","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Temperature sensors","Energy efficiency","Wireless sensor networks","Partitioning algorithms","Query processing","Temperature measurement","Batteries","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","sensor fusion","time series","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient boundary detection","time series snapshot construction","wireless sensor networks","sensed data history","supporting historical queries","time series snapshots","large gradient intervals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","query processing","planar graph"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Gradient Boundary Detection for Time Series Snapshot Construction in Sensor Networks","accessionNumber":"9631544","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302732/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient Boundary Detection for Time Series Snapshot Construction in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"l1462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085718S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4302721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4302721","articleId":"4302732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4302733,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4302721/4302733/4302733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Ma received the BEng degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1997.

A mobile data observer, called SenCar, which could be a mobile robot or a vehicle equipped with a powerful transceiver and battery, works like a mobile base station in the network. SenCar starts the data gathering tour periodically from the static data processing center, traverses the entire sensor network, gathers the data from sensors while moving, returns to the starting point, and, finally, uploads data to the data processing center. Unlike SenCar, sensors in the network are static and can be made very simple and inexpensive. They upload sensed data to SenCar when SenCar moves close to them. Since sensors can only communicate with others within a very limited range, packets from some sensors may need multihop relays to reach SenCar. We first show that the moving path of SenCar can greatly affect network lifetime. We then present heuristic algorithms for planning the moving path/circle of SenCar and balancing traffic load in the network. We show that, by driving SenCar along a better path and balancing the traffic load from sensors to SenCar, network lifetime can be prolonged significantly. Our moving planning algorithm can be used in both connected networks and disconnected networks. In addition, SenCar can avoid obstacles while moving. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data gathering mechanism can prolong network lifetime significantly compared to a network that has only a static observer or a network in which the mobile observer can only move along straight lines.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4302721/04302733.pdf","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SenCar: An Energy-Efficient Data Gathering Mechanism for Large-Scale Multihop Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302733/","displayDocTitle":"SenCar: An Energy-Efficient Data Gathering Mechanism for Large-Scale Multihop Sensor Networks","volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9631545","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302733/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SenCar: An Energy-Efficient Data Gathering Mechanism for Large-Scale Multihop Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"l1476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138954S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4302721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"4302721","articleId":"4302733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4302742,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4302736/4302742/4302742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Yang received the BSc, MS, and PhD degrees in computer science from Jilin University in 1997, 2000, and 2003, respectively.

Algorithms for mining social networks have been developed in the past; however, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive relations and, thus, are not suitable for signed networks. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, called FEC, to mine signed social networks where both positive within-group relations and negative between-group relations are dense. FEC considers both the sign and the density of relations as the clustering attributes, making it effective for not only signed networks but also conventional social networks including only positive relations. Also, FEC adopts an agent-based heuristic that makes the algorithm efficient (in linear time with respect to the size of a network) and capable of giving nearly optimal solutions. FEC depends on only one parameter whose value can easily be set and requires no prior knowledge on hidden community structures. The effectiveness and efficacy of FEC have been demonstrated through a set of rigorous experiments involving both benchmark and randomly generated signed networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4302736/04302742.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.1061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.1061","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Community Mining from Signed Social Networks","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.425a55cb-2bf2-4b50-9d60-38b4035c9d5f","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/05/01/the-fec-algorithm-for-community-mining-from-a-signed-network","name":"The FEC Algorithm for Community Mining from a Signed Network","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=425a55cb-2bf2-4b50-9d60-38b4035c9d5f","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302742/","displayDocTitle":"Community Mining from Signed Social Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302742/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"9685858","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Community Mining from Signed Social Networks","sourcePdf":"k1333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069969S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4302736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"248","xplore-issue":"4302736","articleId":"4302742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302755,"authors":[{"name":"Huaijun Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4302752/4302755/4302755-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaijun (John) Qiu received the BS degree in physics and computer science from East China University of Science and Technology in 2001 and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of York, United Kingdom, in 2006.

Our starting point is the lazy random walk on the graph, which is determined by the heat kernel of the graph and can be computed from the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We characterize the random walk using the commute time (that is, the expected time taken for a random walk to travel between two nodes and return) and show how this quantity may be computed from the Laplacian spectrum using the discrete Green's function. Our motivation is that the commute time can be anticipated to be a more robust measure of the proximity of data than the raw proximity matrix. In this paper, we explore two applications of the commute time. The first is to develop a method for image segmentation using the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the commute time matrix. We show that our commute time segmentation method has the property of enhancing the intragroup coherence while weakening intergroup coherence and is superior to the normalized cut. The second application is to develop a robust multibody motion tracking method using an embedding based on the commute time. Our embedding procedure preserves commute time and is closely akin to kernel PCA, the Laplacian eigenmap, and the diffusion map. We illustrate the results on both synthetic image sequences and real-world video sequences and compare our results with several alternative methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9631499","pubMedId":"17848771","htmlLink":"/document/4302755/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Clustering and Embedding Using Commute Times","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering and Embedding Using Commute Times","sourcePdf":"i1873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100731S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4302756,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Broadwater","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4302752/4302756/4302756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joshua Broadwater received the BE (magna cum laude) degree in electrical engineering and applied mathematics from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, in 1994, the MSEE in electrical engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 1996, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2007.

We present two new hybrid detectors that take advantage of these approaches by modeling the background using both physics and statistics. Results demonstrate improved performance over the well-known AMSD and ACE subpixel algorithms in experiments that include multiple targets, images, and area types - especially when dealing with weak targets in complex backgrounds.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"1891","endPage":"1903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302752","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4302752/04302756.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Building materials","Testing","Detection algorithms","Pixel","Vectors","Array signal processing","Covariance matrix","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","spectral analysis","statistical analysis","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid detectors","subpixel target detection","hyperspectral imagery analysis","physics","statistics","AMSD subpixel algorithm","ACE subpixel algorithm","subspace detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Target detection","subspace detectors","hyperspectral data","spectral mixture models"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Statistical","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Detectors for Subpixel Targets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302756/","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4302756/","accessionNumber":"9686294","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17848772","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Detectors for Subpixel Targets","sourcePdf":"i1891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087409S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4302759,"authors":[{"name":"Ajmal Mian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4302752/4302759/4302759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajmal S.

Our algorithm is multimodal (2D and 3D) and performs hybrid (feature based and holistic) matching in order to achieve efficiency and robustness to facial expressions. The pose of a 3D face along with its texture is automatically corrected using a novel approach based on a single automatically detected point and the Hotelling transform. A novel 3D spherical face representation (SFR) is used in conjunction with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor to form a rejection classifier, which quickly eliminates a large number of candidate faces at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries. The remaining faces are then verified using a novel region-based matching approach, which is robust to facial expressions. This approach automatically segments the eyes- forehead and the nose regions, which are relatively less sensitive to expressions and matches them separately using a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The results of all the matching engines are fused at the metric level to achieve higher accuracy. We use the FRGC benchmark to compare our results to other algorithms that used the same database. Our multimodal hybrid algorithm performed better than others by achieving 99.74 percent and 98.31 percent verification rates at a 0.001 false acceptance rate (FAR) and identification rates of 99.02 percent and 95.37 percent for probes with a neutral and a nonneutral expression, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9631500","pubMedId":"17848775","htmlLink":"/document/4302759/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Multimodal 2D-3D Hybrid Approach to Automatic Face Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Multimodal 2D-3D Hybrid Approach to Automatic Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"i1927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106491S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4302760,"authors":[{"name":"Inderjit S.

In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods - in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means objective is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mathematically equivalent </i>\nto a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods such as Metis have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis, and gene network analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4302752/04302760.pdf","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Graph Cuts without Eigenvectors A Multilevel Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Graph Cuts without Eigenvectors A Multilevel Approach","volume":"29","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4302760/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9631501","pubMedId":"17848776","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Graph Cuts without Eigenvectors A Multilevel Approach","sourcePdf":"i1944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096663S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"474","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4302762,"authors":[{"name":"Gehua Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4302752/4302762/4302762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gehua Yang received the BS degree in applied mathematics from South China University of Technology in 2000 and the MS degree in applied mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2002.

The algorithm should handle low overlap, substantial orientation and scale differences, large illumination variations, and physical changes in the scene. An important component of this is the ability to automatically reject pairs that have no overlap or have too many differences to be aligned well. We propose a complete algorithm including techniques for initialization, for estimating transformation parameters, and for automatically deciding if an estimate is correct. Keypoints extracted and matched between images are used to generate initial similarity transform estimates, each accurate over a small region. These initial estimates are rank-ordered and tested individually in succession. Each estimate is refined using the Dual-Bootstrap ICP algorithm, driven by matching of multiscale features. A three-part decision criteria, combining measurements of alignment accuracy, stability in the estimate, and consistency in the constraints, determines whether the refined transformation estimate is accepted as correct. Experimental results on a data set of 22 challenging image pairs show that the algorithm effectively aligns 19 of the 22 pairs and rejects 99.8 percent of the misalignments that occur when all possible pairs are tried. The algorithm substantially out-performs algorithms based on keypoint matching alone.","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4302752/04302762.pdf","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1116","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302762","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Lighting","Iterative algorithms","Change detection algorithms","Biomedical imaging","Parameter estimation","Testing","Iterative closest point algorithm","Stability criteria","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image registration","medical image processing","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated 2D-image-pair registration","medical images","parameter estimation","keypoint extraction","keypoint matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image registration","feature extraction","iterative closest point","radial lens distortion","decision criteria","keypoint"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Cluster Analysis","Decision Support Techniques","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Registration of Challenging Image Pairs: Initialization, Estimation, and Decision","accessionNumber":"9686297","pubMedId":"17848778","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302762/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Registration of Challenging Image Pairs: Initialization, Estimation, and Decision","sourcePdf":"i1973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104377S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4302765,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Miyazaki","affiliation":["Ikeuchi Laboratory, 3rd Department, Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4302752/4302765/4302765-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daisuke Miyazaki received the BS degree in science in 2000, the MS degree in information science and technology in 2002, and the PhD degree in information science and technology in 2005, all from the University of Tokyo.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating the surface shapes of transparent objects by analyzing the polarization state of the light. Existing methods do not fully consider the reflection, refraction, and transmission of the light occurring inside a transparent object. We employ a polarization raytracing method to compute both the path of the light and its polarization state. Polarization raytracing is a combination of conventional raytracing, which calculates the trajectory of light rays, and Mueller calculus, which calculates the polarization state of the light. First, we set an initial value of the shape of the transparent object. Then, by changing the shape, the method minimizes the difference between the input polarization data and the rendered polarization data calculated by polarization raytracing. Finally, after the iterative computation is converged, the shape of the object is obtained. We also evaluate the method by measuring some real transparent objects.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4302752/04302765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4302752","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape Estimation of Transparent Objects by Using Inverse Polarization Ray Tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shape Estimation of Transparent Objects by Using Inverse Polarization Ray Tracing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4302765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9680276","pubMedId":"17848781","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4302765/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Estimation of Transparent Objects by Using Inverse Polarization Ray Tracing","sourcePdf":"i2018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121433S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4302752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4302752","articleId":"4302765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4302973,"authors":[{"name":"Yue-De Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4302825/4302826/4302973/4302973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yue-De Yang received the B.

However, these cross-layer transmission strategies can be efficiently optimized only if they use accurate information about the network conditions and hence, are able to timely adapt to network changes. Due to the informationally decentralized nature of the multihop wireless network, performing centralized optimization for delay-sensitive video streaming application based on global information about the network status is not practical. Distributed solutions that adapt the transmission strategies based on timely information feedback need to be considered. To acquire this information feedback for cross-layer adaptation, we deploy an overlay infrastructure, which is able to relay the necessary information about the network status and incurred delays across different network ldquohorizonsrdquo (i.e., across a different number of hops in a predetermined period of time). In this paper, we propose a distributed streaming approach that is optimized based on the local information feedback acquired from the various network horizons. We investigate the distributed cross-layer adaptation at each wireless node by considering the advantages resulting from an accurate and frequent network information feedback from larger horizons as well as the drawbacks resulting from an increased transmission overhead. Based on the information feedback, we can estimate the risk that packets from different priority classes will not arrive at their destination before their decoding deadline expires. Subsequently, the various transmission strategies such as packet scheduling, retransmission limit and dynamic routing policies are adapted to jointly consider the estimated risk as well as the impact in terms of distortion of the different priority classes. Our results show that the proposed dynamic routing policy based on timely information feedback outperforms existing state-of-the-art on-demand routing solutions by more than 2 dB in terms of the received video quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303033/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633288","volume":"9","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Informationally Decentralized Video Streaming Over Multihop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informationally Decentralized Video Streaming Over Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"09tmm06-shiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090739S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4303015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4303015","articleId":"4303033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4303048,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano Niclass","affiliation":["F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Ecole Polytechnique, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Cristiano Niclass received the M.S. degree in Microtechnology from EPFL in 2003.","In May 2003, he joined the Processor Architecture Laboratory (LAP) of EPFL and subsequently the Quantum Architecture Group (AQUA), where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree.

A well-known problem of OFDM is its sensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier frequencies. This frequency offset introduces inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM symbol. In this letter, we investigate two methods for combating the effects of ICI: the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method and a form of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method called sequential importance sampling (SIS). Through simulations, we explore the efficiency of these two methods for various frequency offsets and different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our estimates of the frequency offset are very satisfactory, especially in the latter case, resulting in performance improvement of the OFDM modulation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.898321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4303057/04303079.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.898321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian State\u2013Space Approach to Combat Inter-Carrier Interference in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303079/","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian State\u2013Space Approach to Combat Inter-Carrier Interference in OFDM Systems","volume":"14","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633261","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303079/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian State\u2013Space Approach to Combat Inter-Carrier Interference in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"14lsp10-palamides.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046098S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4303057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4303057","articleId":"4303079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303081,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Ravelli","affiliation":["Institut Jean Le Rond d'Alembert-LAM, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Ravelli","id":"37297020400"},{"name":"Laurent Daudet","affiliation":["Institut Jean Le Rond d'Alembert-LAM, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Daudet","id":"37332759400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4303081","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":286},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Audio coding","Bandwidth","Binary codes","Image coding","Binary trees","Minimization methods","Equations","Approximation algorithms","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Gaussian processes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion performance","Gaussian data","high-rate approximation","refinement algorithm","quadratic error minimization problem","unrestricted polar quantization","strict polar quantization","refinement processes","constrained-resolution embedded quantization","parametric audio","fine-grain scalable coding","circularly symmetric data","progressive transmission","embedded polar quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded quantization","quantizer design","scalable audio coding"]}],"abstract":"Embedded polar quantization can be useful for progressive transmission of circularly symmetric data, e.g., for fine-grain scalable coding of parametric audio.

For Gaussian data, comparisons with reference non-embedded quantizers show that the embedding property comes at an often negligible cost in terms of rate-distortion performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Polar Quantization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4303057/04303081.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Polar Quantization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303081/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633263","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Polar Quantization","sourcePdf":"14lsp10-ravelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076149S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4303057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4303057","articleId":"4303081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4303085,"authors":[{"name":"Vimal Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Atilim University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Vimal","lastName":"Singh","id":"37278260900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4303085","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Quantization","Symmetric matrices","Lyapunov method","Arithmetic","Digital filters","Multidimensional systems","Stability criteria","Nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","digital filters","discrete systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability","2D discrete systems","Roesser model","state saturation arithmetic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","digital filter wordlength effects","Lyapunov methods","multidimensional systems","state saturation nonlinearity"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Criterion for Global Asymptotic Stability of 2-D Discrete Systems With State Saturation","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303057","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4303057/04303085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896432","startPage":"719","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303085","abstract":"A criterion for the global asymptotic stability of 2D discrete systems described by the Roesser model employing state saturation arithmetic is presented.

The main contribution of the present letter is a compressed sensing-based novel nonparametric shape estimation framework and a computational algorithm for binary star shape objects, whose radius functions belong to the space of bounded-variation functions. Specifically, in contrast with standard compressed sensing, the present approach involves directly reconstructing the shape boundary under sparsity constraint. This is done by converting the standard pixel-based reconstruction approach into estimation of a nonparametric shape boundary on a wavelet basis. This results in an L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization under a nonlinear constraint, which makes the optimization problem nonconvex.

Fourier imaging simulation results demonstrate that high quality reconstruction can be quickly obtained from a very limited number of samples.

Previous robots that automate this technique impose constraints on naturalistic walking due to their kinematic structure, and are typically operated in a stiff mode, limiting the ability of the patient or human trainer to influence the stepping pattern. We developed a pneumatic gait training robot that allows for a full range of natural motion of the legs and pelvis during treadmill walking, and provides compliant assistance. However, we observed an unexpected consequence of the devices compliance: unimpaired and SCI individuals invariably began walking out-of-phase with the device. Thus, the robot perturbed rather than assisted stepping. To address this problem, we developed a novel algorithm that synchronizes the device in real-time to the actual motion of the individual by sensing the state error and adjusting the replay timing to reduce this error. This paper describes data from experiments with individuals with SCI that demonstrate the effectiveness of the synchronization algorithm, and the potential of the device for relieving the trainers of strenuous work while maintaining naturalistic stepping.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4303094/04303096.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robot and Control Algorithm That Can Synchronously Assist in Naturalistic Motion During Body-Weight-Supported Gait Training Following Neurologic Injury","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Robot and Control Algorithm That Can Synchronously Assist in Naturalistic Motion During Body-Weight-Supported Gait Training Following Neurologic Injury","volume":"15","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633229","pubMedId":"17894271","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303096/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robot and Control Algorithm That Can Synchronously Assist in Naturalistic Motion During Body-Weight-Supported Gait Training Following Neurologic Injury","sourcePdf":"15tnsre03-aoyagi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081213S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4303094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"4303094","articleId":"4303096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303103,"authors":[{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["GT Bionics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/4303094/4303103/4303103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maysam Ghovanloo (S'00\u2013M'04) was born in 1973.

Modular standalone architecture allows up to 32 chips to be individually addressed and operated in parallel to drive up to 2048 stimulating sites. The only off-chip components are a receiver inductive-capac- itive (LC) tank, a capacitive low-pass filter for ripple rejection, and arrays of microelectrodes for interfacing with the neural tissue. The implant receives inductive power up to 50 mW and data at 2.5 Mb/s from a frequency shift keyed (FSK) 5/10 MHZ carrier to generate up to 65 800 stimulus pulses/s. Each Interestim-2B chip contains 16 current drivers with 270 muA full-scale current, 5-bit (32-steps) digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution, 100 MOmega output impedance, and a voltage compliance that extends within 150 and 250 mV of the 5 V supply and ground rails, respectively. It can generate any arbitrary current waveform and supports a variety of monopolar and bipolar stimulation protocols. A common analog line provides access to each site potential, and exhausts residual stimulus charges for charge balancing. The chip has site potential measurement and in situ site impedance measurement capabilities, which help its users indicate defective sites or characteristic shifts in chronic stimulations. Interestim-2B chip is fabricated in the AMI 1.5 mum standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process and measures 4.6 x 4.6 x 0.5 mm. The prototype implant size including test connectors is 19 X 14 x 6 mm, which can be shrunk down to <0.5 CC. This paper also summarizes some of the in vitro and in vivo experiments performed using the Interestim-2B prototype implant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wireless Implantable Multichannel Microstimulating System-on-a-Chip With Modular Architecture","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903970","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4303094/04303103.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303094","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Wireless Implantable Multichannel Microstimulating System-on-a-Chip With Modular Architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4303103/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633232","pubMedId":"17894278","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wireless Implantable Multichannel Microstimulating System-on-a-Chip With Modular Architecture","sourcePdf":"15tnsre03-ghovanloo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080027S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4303094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4303094","articleId":"4303103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303104,"authors":[{"name":"Hermano Igo Krebs","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Neurology Department, Weill Medical College, Burke Medical Research Institute, Cornell University, White Plains, NY, USA","Neurology Department, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/4303094/4303104/4303104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hermano Igo Krebs (M'96\u2013SM'06) received the electrician degree from Escola Tecnica Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1976, the B.S. and M.S. degrees in naval engineering (option electrical) from University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1980 and 1987, respectively.

MIT-MANUS proved an excellent tool for shoulder and elbow rehabilitation in stroke patients, showing in clinical trials a reduction of impairment in movements confined to the exercised joints. This successful proof of principle as to additional targeted and intensive movement treatment prompted a test of robot training examining other limb segments. This paper focuses on a robot for wrist rehabilitation designed to provide three rotational degrees-of-freedom. The first clinical trial of the device will enroll 200 stroke survivors. Ultimately 160 stroke survivors will train with both the proximal shoulder and elbow MIT-MANUS robot, as well as with the novel distal wrist robot, in addition to 40 stroke survivor controls. So far 52 stroke patients have completed the robot training (ongoing protocol). Here, we report on the initial results on 36 of these volunteers. These results demonstrate that further improvement should be expected by adding additional training to other limb segments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4303094/04303104.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303094","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot-Aided Neurorehabilitation: A Robot for Wrist Rehabilitation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rehabilitation robotics","Wrist","Mechanical engineering","Nervous system","Shoulder","Elbow","Clinical trials","Testing","Protocols","Central nervous system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","medical robotics","neurophysiology","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot-aided neuro-rehabilitation","wrist rehabilitation","MIT-MANUS","motor function","stroke patients","motion impairment","robot training","rotational degrees-of-freedom","distal wrist robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neurorehabilitation","rehabilitation robotics","stroke","wrist robot"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Exercise Movement Techniques","Exercise Movement Techniques","Exercise Movement Techniques","Exercise Therapy","Exercise Therapy","Exercise Therapy","Humans","Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive","Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive","Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive","Movement Disorders","Neurology","Neurology","Neurology","Rehabilitation","Rehabilitation","Rehabilitation","Robotics","Robotics","Robotics","Stroke","Technology Assessment, Biomedical","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Wrist Joint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robot-Aided Neurorehabilitation: A Robot for Wrist Rehabilitation","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4303104/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633233","pubMedId":"17894265","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot-Aided Neurorehabilitation: A Robot for Wrist Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"15tnsre03-krebs.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118161S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4303094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"323","xplore-issue":"4303094","articleId":"4303104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4303112,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas G.

Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense, repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability, it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self feeding. The future improvement of the device involves increased degrees-of-freedom and interactive control to adapt to a user's physical conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4303094/04303112.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Control of RUPERT: A Device for Robotic Upper Extremity Repetitive Therapy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303112/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Control of RUPERT: A Device for Robotic Upper Extremity Repetitive Therapy","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633240","pubMedId":"17894266","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303112/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Control of RUPERT: A Device for Robotic Upper Extremity Repetitive Therapy","sourcePdf":"15tnsre03-sugar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08597S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4303094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"4303094","articleId":"4303112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4303113,"authors":[{"name":"Jan F.

Evaluation measurements show that the device allows both a \"pa- tient-in-charge\" and \"robot-in-charge\" mode, in which the robot is controlled either to follow or to guide a patient, respectively. Electromyography (EMG) measurements (one subject) on eight important leg muscles, show that free walking in the device strongly resembles free treadmill walking; an indication that the device can offer task-specific gait training. The possibilities and limitations to using the device as gait measurement tool are also shown at the moment position measurements are not accurate enough for inverse-dynamical gait analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4303094/04303113.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Evaluation of the LOPES Exoskeleton Robot for Interactive Gait Rehabilitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Evaluation of the LOPES Exoskeleton Robot for Interactive Gait Rehabilitation","volume":"15","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303113/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633241","pubMedId":"17894270","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Evaluation of the LOPES Exoskeleton Robot for Interactive Gait Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"15tnsre03-veneman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082736S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4303094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"825","xplore-issue":"4303094","articleId":"4303113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4303125,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Da Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Reliable Systems (ARES) Laboratory, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4303116/4303125/4303125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Da Huang received the B.S. degree from Chung Yuan Christian University, Jhongli, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2003, and the M.S. degree from the National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2005, both in electrical engineering.","Since 2007, he has been with the Generalplus Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."]},"firstName":"Chao-Da","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281285000"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Reliable Systems (ARES) Laboratory, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4303116/4303125/4303125-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Fu Li (S'01\u2013M'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, R.O.C., where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Efficient yield-enhancement techniques thus are required for the memory cores in SOCs. This paper presents an infrastructure intelligent property (IIP) for testing, diagnosing, and repairing multiple memory cores in SOCs. The proposed IIP can perform parallel testing for multiple memories, and serial diagnosis or repair for one memory each time. In the repair mode, the proposed IIP can execute various redundancy analysis algorithms. Therefore, the user can select a better redundancy analysis algorithm for each memory core being tested according to its redundancy structure. Simulation results show that the proposed IIP needs less test time and redundancy analysis time than the processor-based built-in self-repair scheme. We also have realized the proposed IIP for four types of memories - two 8 K 64 bit SRAMs, one 4 K x 16 bit SRAM, and one 2 K x 32 bit SRAM - based on TSMC 0.18-mum standard cell technology.

Physical constraints, such as the maximum number of planes that can be vertically stacked and the asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical communication channels of the network, are included in speed and power consumption models of these novel 3D structures. An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network. A performance improvement of 40% and 36% and a decrease of 62% and 58% in power consumption is demonstrated for 3D NoC as compared to a traditional 2D NoC topology for a network size of N = 128 and N = 256 nodes, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303130/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633225","volume":"15","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"3-D Topologies for Networks-on-Chip","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Topologies for Networks-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi10-pavlidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085187S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4303116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"4303116","articleId":"4303130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303132,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital and Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4303116/4303132/4303132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Wang received the M.Sc. degree in electronic circuits and systems from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China in 2002.","Currently, he is a Researcher with the Institute of Digital and Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland.

A packet switched network-on-chip (NoC) that applies the CDMA technique is realized in register-transfer level (RTL) using VHDL. The realized CDMA NoC supports the globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) communication scheme by applying both synchronous and asynchronous designs. In a packet switched NoC, which applies a point-to-point connection scheme, e.g., a ring topology NoC, data transfer latency varies largely if the packets are transferred to different destinations or to the same destination through different routes in the network. The CDMA NoC can eliminate the data transfer latency variations by sharing the data communication media among multiple users concurrently. A six-node GALS CDMA on-chip network is modeled and simulated. The characteristics of the CDMA NoC are examined by comparing them with the characteristics of an on-chip bidirectional ring topology network. The simulation results reveal that the data transfer latency in the CDMA NoC is a constant value for a certain length of packet and is equivalent to the best case data transfer latency in the bidirectional ring network when data path width is set to 32 bits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Network-on-a-chip","Packet switching","Delay","Switching circuits","Communication switching","Network topology","Communication networks","System-on-a-chip","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","code division multiple access","hardware description languages","network-on-chip","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA technique","code-division multiple access technique","on-chip packet switched communication network","packet switched network-on-chip","register-transfer level","VHDL","globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous communication scheme","data transfer latency","data communication media","on-chip bidirectional ring topology network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","integrated circuit (IC) design","network-on-chip (NoC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303132","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.903914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4303116/04303132.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.903914","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying CDMA Technique to Network-on-Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applying CDMA Technique to Network-on-Chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303132/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","volume":"15","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303132/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633227","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying CDMA Technique to Network-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi10-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098416S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4303116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4303116","articleId":"4303132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4303144,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew W.

At each iteration of an MM algorithm, one constructs a tangent majorant function that majorizes the given cost function and is equal to it at the current iterate. The next iterate is obtained by minimizing this tangent majorant function, resulting in a sequence of iterates that reduces the cost function monotonically. A well-known special case of MM methods are expectation-maximization algorithms. In this paper, we expand on previous analyses of MM, due to Fessler and Hero, that allowed the tangent majorants to be constructed in iteration-dependent ways. Also, this paper overcomes an error in one of those earlier analyses. There are three main aspects in which our analysis builds upon previous work. First, our treatment relaxes many assumptions related to the structure of the cost function, feasible set, and tangent majorants. For example, the cost function can be nonconvex and the feasible set for the problem can be any convex set. Second, we propose convergence conditions, based on upper curvature bounds, that can be easier to verify than more standard continuity conditions. Furthermore, these conditions allow for considerable design freedom in the iteration-dependent behavior of the algorithm. Finally, we give an original characterization of the local region of convergence of MM algorithms based on connected (e.g., convex) tangent majorants. For such algorithms, cost function minimizers will locally attract the iterates over larger neighborhoods than typically is guaranteed with other methods. This expanded treatment widens the scope of the MM algorithm designs that can be considered for signal and image processing applications, allows us to verify the convergent behavior of previously published algorithms, and gives a fuller understanding overall of how these algorithms behave.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4303133/04303144.pdf","startPage":"2411","endPage":"2422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.904387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.904387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Expanded Theoretical Treatment of Iteration-Dependent Majorize-Minimize Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Signal processing algorithms","Image processing","Jacobian matrices","Signal processing","Statistics","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Maximum likelihood estimation","Expectation-maximization algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm","image processing","minimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iteration-dependent majorize-minimize algorithms","majorize-minimize optimization","tangent majorant function","convergence condition","upper curvature bounds","expectation-maximization algorithm","signal processing","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expectation-maximization (EM)","majorize-minimize (MM)","optimization transfer","SAGE"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Likelihood Functions","Positron-Emission Tomography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Expanded Theoretical Treatment of Iteration-Dependent Majorize-Minimize Algorithms","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303144/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633204","pubMedId":"17926925","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Expanded Theoretical Treatment of Iteration-Dependent Majorize-Minimize Algorithms","sourcePdf":"16tip10-jacobson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118584S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4303133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4303133","articleId":"4303144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4303146,"authors":[{"name":"Nai-Xiang Lian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4303133/4303146/4303146-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nai-Xiang Lian (S'06) received the B.Eng. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chendu, China, in 1996, and the M.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1999, respectively.

The interpolation process is commonly known as demosaicking. In general, a good demosaicking method should preserve the high-frequency information of imagery as much as possible, since such information is essential for image visual quality. We discuss in this paper two key observations for preserving high-frequency information in CFA demosaicking: (1) the high frequencies are similar across three color components, and 2) the high frequencies along the horizontal and vertical axes are essential for image quality. Our frequency analysis of CFA samples indicates that filtering a CFA image can better preserve high frequencies than filtering each color component separately. This motivates us to design an efficient filter for estimating the luminance at green pixels of the CFA image and devise an adaptive filtering approach to estimating the luminance at red and blue pixels. Experimental results on simulated CFA images, as well as raw CFA data, verify that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both visually and in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, at a notably lower computational cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.904459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4303133/04303146.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2525","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.904459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Filtering for Color Filter Array Demosaicking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Filtering for Color Filter Array Demosaicking","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303146/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633206","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","pubMedId":"17926933","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Filtering for Color Filter Array Demosaicking","sourcePdf":"16tip10-lian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119509S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4303133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4303133","articleId":"4303146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303151,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Puri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4303133/4303151/4303151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rohit Puri (S'99\u2013M'04) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, the M.S. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 2003 to 2004, he was with Sony Electronics, Inc., San Jose, CA.

PRISM represents a major departure from conventional video coding architectures (e.g., the MPEGx, H.26x families) that are based on motion-compensated predictive coding, with the goal of addressing some of their architectural limitations. PRISM allows for two key architectural enhancements: (1) inbuilt robustness to \"drift\" between encoder and decoder and (2) the feasibility of a flexible distribution of computational complexity between encoder and decoder. Specifically, PRISM enables transfer of the computationally expensive video encoder motion-search module to the video decoder. Based on this capability, we consider an instance of PRISM corresponding to a near reversal in codec complexities with respect to today's codecs (leading to a novel light encoder and heavy decoder paradigm), in this paper. We present encouraging preliminary results on real-world video sequences, particularly in the realm of transmission losses, where PRISM exhibits the characteristic of rapid recovery, in contrast to contemporary codecs. This renders PRISM as an attractive candidate for wireless video applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.904949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4303133/04303151.pdf","startPage":"2436","endPage":"2448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.904949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRISM: A Video Coding Paradigm With Motion Estimation at the Decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303151/","displayDocTitle":"PRISM: A Video Coding Paradigm With Motion Estimation at the Decoder","volume":"16","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303151/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633210","pubMedId":"17926927","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRISM: A Video Coding Paradigm With Motion Estimation at the Decoder","sourcePdf":"16tip10-puri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095616S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4303133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"230","xplore-issue":"4303133","articleId":"4303151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4303157,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zou","affiliation":["National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA","Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4303133/4303157/4303157-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Zou (M'00) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2004.","Since 2005, he has been with the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine.

To determine how they can be best used for face recognition, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study at each step of the local matching process. The conclusions from our experiments include: (1) additional evidence that Gabor features are effective local feature representations and are robust to illumination changes; (2) discrimination based only on a small portion of the face area is surprisingly good; (3) the configuration of facial components does contain rich discriminating information and comparing corresponding local regions utilizes shape features more effectively than comparing corresponding facial components; (4) spatial multiresolution analysis leads to better classification performance; (5) combining local regions with Borda count classifier combination method alleviates the curse of dimensionality. We implemented a complete face recognition system by integrating the best option of each step. Without training, illumination compensation and without any parameter tuning, it achieves superior performance on every category of the FERET test: near perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on pictures taken on the same day regardless of indoor illumination variations, and significantly better than any other reported performance on pictures taken several days to more than a year apart.

Using this principle, we developed a set of general lumped circuit methods based on a toroidal Mn-Zn ferrite core as the measurement sample. We examined two possible different excitation modes: magnetic field excitation and electric field excitation. The two different excitation modes result in significantly different field distributions in the sample. Thus, high accuracy can be guaranteed in principle. For the magnetic field excitation, we present in this paper a general finite-difference method to solve the fields in the core and the impedance of the ferrite core inductor. To avoid the stray capacitance among the coils of the ferrite core winding inductor in the measurement, we made a set of short-ended coaxial test fixtures. We performed experiments to determine the intrinsic complex permeability and permittivity of a Mn-Zn ferrite core up to 10 MHz by using the two general methods and validated the measured intrinsic values experimentally.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a Single Toroidal Sample to Determine the Intrinsic Complex Permeability and Permittivity of Mn\u2013Zn Ferrites","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.903294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4303190/04303203.pdf","startPage":"3807","endPage":"3815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.903294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Using a Single Toroidal Sample to Determine the Intrinsic Complex Permeability and Permittivity of Mn\u2013Zn Ferrites","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303203/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633136","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a Single Toroidal Sample to Determine the Intrinsic Complex Permeability and Permittivity of Mn\u2013Zn Ferrites","sourcePdf":"43tmag10-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075208S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4303190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4303190","articleId":"4303203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303204,"authors":[{"name":"Ruo-Fan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Material Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ruo-Fan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37305168800"},{"name":"Nazmun N.

The method, referred here as distributed multipole (DMP) modeling, inherits many advantages of the dipole model originally conceptualized in the context of physics, but provides an effective means to account for the shape and magnetization of the physical magnet. Three examples are given to illustrate the procedure of developing a DMP model, which derives an appropriate set of distributed dipoles from a limited set of known field points, for a general cylindrical PM, a customized PM, and a multilayer coil. The DMP modeling method has been validated by comparing simulated fields and calculated forces against data obtained experimentally and numerically; the comparisons show excellent agreement. Finally, we illustrate how the closed-form DMP models can offer an inexpensive means to visualize the effect of the EM fields on the leakage and unexpected flux paths, which have significant influences on the magnetic torque of a spherical motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303205/","accessionNumber":"9633138","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Multipole Model for Design of Permanent-Magnet-Based Actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Multipole Model for Design of Permanent-Magnet-Based Actuators","sourcePdf":"43tmag10-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087345S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4303190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4303190","articleId":"4303205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303207,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

However, the decision feedback tends to increase the circuit critical path and, more important, makes it difficult to apply some well-proven high-speed trellis detector design techniques such as bit-level pipelining. This paper presents a method, referred to as quasi-reduced-state trellis detection, to tackle such speed bottlenecks. The basic idea is to simply obviate the use of decision feedback by mapping only the data storage block of the trellis detector onto a reduced-state trellis and keeping the trellis state metric computation on the original full-state trellis. This makes sense because the data storage block tends to dominate the overall energy consumption while the decision feedback is due to the reduced-state trellis metric computation. Therefore, it is intuitive that such quasi-reduced-state detectors may largely maintain the energy saving potentials of reduced-state trellis detection without being subject to decision-feedback-induced speed bottlenecks. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this proposed design method by using soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) detection for a magnetic recording read channel as a test vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.904190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4303190/04303215.pdf","startPage":"3921","endPage":"3924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.904190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Reduced-State Soft-Output Viterbi Detector for Magnetic Recording Read Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Reduced-State Soft-Output Viterbi Detector for Magnetic Recording Read Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303215/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9633144","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303215/","volume":"43","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Reduced-State Soft-Output Viterbi Detector for Magnetic Recording Read Channel","sourcePdf":"43tmag10-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071084S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4303190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4303190","articleId":"4303215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4303216,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538725400"},{"name":"Wentai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wentai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279763700"},{"name":"Eric Basham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Basham","id":"37424383500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4303216","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2974},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Implants","Coils","Frequency","Batteries","Skin","Biomedical telemetry","Parasitic capacitance","Power dissipation","Q factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","biomedical telemetry","power inductors","prosthetic power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transfer capacity","design parameters","biomedical telemetry","biomedical applications","closed-form design equations","quality factor","self-resonant frequency","self-capacitance property","coils","ac power dissipation","implantable electronics","wireless links","inductor modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical telemetry"," $Q$","self-resonant frequency"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the ac power dissipation of coils as well as their self-capacitance, self-resonant frequency, and quality factor Q. In the past, self-resonant frequency was rarely calculated during design because of the lack of suitable closed-form design equations. However, coils are widely used in biomedical applications as inductive links for both power and data, and the power transfer capacity and the data rate of inductive links are determined by the operating frequency of the coils. The maximum operating frequency is limited by the self-resonant frequency of the coil. We present here an analytical express for the optimal frequency of a coil in terms of the design parameters. By varying the design parameters, we can move the optimal frequency close to the operating frequency, thereby boosting the efficiency of the inductive link. We have verified the derivation experimentally and shown it to be useful in optimizing coil Index performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.904189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4303190/04303216.pdf","startPage":"3851","endPage":"3860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.904189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inductor Modeling in Wireless Links for Implantable Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303216/","displayDocTitle":"Inductor Modeling in Wireless Links for Implantable Electronics","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633145","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303216/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductor Modeling in Wireless Links for Implantable Electronics","sourcePdf":"43tmag10-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070361S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4303190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4303190","articleId":"4303216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4303228,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim M.

These dynamic controllers combine a logical switching architecture with continuous dynamics to guarantee that the system plant energy is strictly decreasing across switchings. The general framework leads to closed-loop systems described by impulsive differential equations. In addition, we construct hybrid dynamic controllers that guarantee that the closed-loop system is consistent with basic thermodynamic principles. In particular, the existence of an entropy function for the closed-loop system is established that satisfies a hybrid Clausius-type inequality. Special cases of energy-based and entropy-based hybrid controllers involving state-dependent switching are described.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.904452","startPage":"1604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4303218/04303228.pdf","endPage":"1614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.904452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303228/","displayDocTitle":"Energy- and Entropy-Based Stabilization for Lossless Dynamical Systems via Hybrid Controllers","volume":"52","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9624635","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy- and Entropy-Based Stabilization for Lossless Dynamical Systems via Hybrid Controllers","sourcePdf":"52tac09-haddad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046838S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4303218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"36","articleId":"4303228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303232,"authors":[{"name":"Minyi Huang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/4303218/4303232/4303232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minyi Huang (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.Sc. degree from Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China, in 1995, the M.Sc. degree from the Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in 2003, all in the area of systems and control.","From February 2004 to March 2006, he was a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. from April 2006 to June 2007, he was a Research Fellow with the Department of Information Engineering, Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

In a group of 10 normal and 25 OSA subjects, the sample entropy measure showed that normal subjects have significantly more complex HRV pattern than the OSA subjects (p < 0.005). When compared with spectral analysis in a minute-by-minute classification, sample entropy had an accuracy of 70.3% (69.5% sensitivity, 70.8% specificity) while the spectral analysis had an accuracy of 70.4% (71.3% sensitivity, 69.9% specificity). The combination of the two methods improved the accuracy to 72.9% (72.2% sensitivity, 73.3% specificity). The sample entropy approach does not show major improvement over the existing methods. In fact, its accuracy in detecting sleep apnea is relatively low in the well classified data of the physionet. Its main achievement however, is the simplicity of computation.

The study used a balanced half-wave dipole antenna, which was energized with a signal at the standard power level for each technology, and then brought towards the medical device while noting the distance at which interference became apparent. Additional testing was performed with signals that comply with the requirements of the international immunity standard to RF fields, IEC 61000-4-3. The testing provides a sense of the overall interference impact that GPRS and WCDMA (frequency division duplex) may have, relative to current mobile technologies, and to the internationally recognized standard for radiated RF immunity. Ten medical devices were tested: two pulse oximeters, a blood pressure monitor, a patient monitor, a humidifier, three models of cardiac defibrillator, and two models of infusion pump. Our conclusion from this and a related study on consumer devices is that WCDMA handsets are unlikely to be a significant interference threat to medical electronics at typical separation distances.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4303255/04303265.pdf","startPage":"1858","endPage":"1866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.904530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.904530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potential GPRS 900/180-MHz and WCDMA 1900-MHz Interference to Medical Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Multiaccess communication","Radio frequency","Biomedical monitoring","Radiofrequency interference","Telephone sets","Immunity testing","Immune system","IEC standards","Patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","biomedical equipment","code division multiple access","dipole antennas","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic interference","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiac defibrillator","humidifier","patient monitor","blood pressure monitor","pulse oximeters","balanced half-wave dipole antenna","wideband code division multiple access","general packet radio service","WCDMA","GPRS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)","electromagnetic interference","medical electronics","mobile communications"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Cellular Phone","Equipment Failure","Equipment Failure Analysis","Equipment and Supplies","Microwaves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Potential GPRS 900/180-MHz and WCDMA 1900-MHz Interference to Medical Devices","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303265/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633115","pubMedId":"17926684","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential GPRS 900/180-MHz and WCDMA 1900-MHz Interference to Medical Devices","sourcePdf":"54tbme10-iskra.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066781S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4303255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4303255","articleId":"4303265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4303268,"authors":[{"name":"Chiara Dalla Man","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4303255/4303268/4303268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiara Dalla Man was born in Venice, Italy, on March 2, 1977.

Here, we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal.

Worm shape and conformations are expressed in a decoupled manner. Complex worm movements are expressed in terms of three primitive patterns-peristaltic progression, deformation, and translation. The model has been incorporated into algorithms for segmentation and simultaneous tracking of multiple worms in a field, some of which may be interacting in complex ways. A recursive Bayesian filter is used for tracking. Unpredictable behaviors associated with interactions are resolved by multiple-hypothesis tracking. Our algorithm can track worms of diverse sizes and conformations (coiled/uncoiled) in the presence of imaging artifacts and clutter, even when worms are overlapping with others. A two-observer performance assessment was conducted over 16 image sequences representing wild-type and uncoordinated mutants as a function of worm size, conformation, presence of clutter, and worm entanglement. Overall detected tracking failures were 1.41%, undetected tracking failures were 0.41%, and segmentation errors were 1.11% of worm length. When worms overlap, our method reduced undetected failures from 12% to 1.75%, and segmentation error from 11% to 5%. Our method provides the basis for reliable morphometric and locomotory analysis of freely behaving worm populations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4303255/04303276.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.894981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.894981","startPage":"1786","endPage":"1797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computational Model for <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">C. elegans </emphasis>Locomotory Behavior: Application to Multiworm Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303276/","displayDocTitle":"A Computational Model for <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">C. elegans </emphasis>Locomotory Behavior: Application to Multiworm Tracking","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303276/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"9633123","pubMedId":"17926677","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Model for <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">C. elegans </emphasis>Locomotory Behavior: Application to Multiworm Tracking","sourcePdf":"54tbme10-roussel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102773S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4303255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4303255","articleId":"4303276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303277,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Tong","affiliation":["Medical Image Computing Group, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4303255/4303277/4303277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shan Tong (S'06) received the B.E. degree (with distinction) in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003.

In this paper, a sampled-data filtering framework is presented for the recovery of cardiac motion and deformation functions from periodic medical image sequences. Cardiac dynamics is a continuously evolving physical/physiological process, whereas the imaging data can provide only sampled measurements at discrete time instants. Given such a hybrid paradigm, stochastic multiframe filtering frameworks are constructed to couple the continuous dynamics with the discrete measurements, and to coordinately deal with the parameter uncertainty of the biomechanical constraining model and the noisy nature of the imaging data. The state estimates are predicted according to the continuous-time biomechanically constructed state equation between observation time points, and then updated with the new imaging-derived measurements at discrete time instants, yielding physically more meaningful and more accurate estimation results.

Yin Yang bipolar sets are introduced for neurobiological modeling and diagnostic analysis of such disorders. It is shown that bipolar sets and a bipolar dynamic modus ponens (BDMP) build a technological bridge from a linear, static, and closed world to a nonlinear, dynamic, and open world of equilibria, quasi-equilibria, or nonequilibria and provide a novel model for bipolar neurobiological diagnostic analysis with added rigor to the current standard. It is shown that bipolar inference can help in understanding both the classic manifestations and the counterintuitive symptoms of bipolar disorders with applications in clinical psychopharmacology. Mathematical and visual characterizations of core features of such disorders are presented. A unified diagnosis and outcome model of different treatments are presented for different types of bipolar disorders. The significance and novelty of this work is twofold: 1) it introduces YinYang into biomedicine for the understanding of certain neurobiological disorders and fosters a new standard model for clinical, therapeutic, and pharmacological research and applications; 2) it presents a mathematical basis for the characterization of mood regulation in individuals and/or a cohort of patients with applications in biomedical engineering and potential applications in nanotechnologies for integrated care of major depressive and bipolar disorders.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yinyang dynamic neurobiological modeling and diagnostic analysis of major depressive and bipolar disorders","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.894832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4303255/04303282.pdf","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.894832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Yinyang dynamic neurobiological modeling and diagnostic analysis of major depressive and bipolar disorders","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4303282/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633129","pubMedId":"17926671","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yinyang dynamic neurobiological modeling and diagnostic analysis of major depressive and bipolar disorders","sourcePdf":"54tbme10-wzhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07435S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4303255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4303255","articleId":"4303282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303286,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The basic principle of the UCCA frequency invariant beamformer (FIB) is to transform the received signals to the phase mode representation and remove the frequency dependence of individual phase modes through the use of a digital beamforming or compensation network. As a result, the far field pattern of the array is electronic steerable and is approximately invariant over a wider range of frequencies than the uniform circular arrays (UCAs). The beampattern is governed by a small set of variable beamformer weights. Based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) and generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) methods, new recursive adaptive beamforming algorithms for UCCA-FIB are proposed. In addition, robust versions of these adaptive beamforming algorithms for mitigating direction-of-arrival (DOA) and sensor position errors are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive UCCA-FIBs converge much faster and reach a considerable lower steady-state error than conventional broadband UCCA beamformers without using the compensation network. Since fewer variable multipliers are required in the proposed algorithms, it also leads to lower arithmetic complexity and faster tracking performance than conventional methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.904648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303284","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1949","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4303284/04303286.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Using Frequency Invariant Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303286/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Using Frequency Invariant Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633090","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming Using Frequency Invariant Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays","sourcePdf":"54tcsi09-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074356S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4303284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4303284","articleId":"4303286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4303287,"authors":[{"name":"Huawei Chen","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4303284/4303287/4303287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huawei Chen was born in Henan, China, in 1977.

The proposed model is validated with a hardware prototype and a detailed simulation, and is shown to be an improvement over previously established models in the time and frequency domains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parasitics Realization in State-Space Average-Value Modeling of PWM DC\u2013DC Converters Using an Equal Area Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.904686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4303284/04303291.pdf","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.904686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Parasitics Realization in State-Space Average-Value Modeling of PWM DC\u2013DC Converters Using an Equal Area Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4303291/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633092","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitics Realization in State-Space Average-Value Modeling of PWM DC\u2013DC Converters Using an Equal Area Method","sourcePdf":"54tcsi09-davoudi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054815S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4303284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4303284","articleId":"4303291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303295,"authors":[{"name":"Yongru Gu","affiliation":["Media, Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4303284/4303295/4303295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongru Gu (M'05) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2005.","His research interests lie in algorithm development, VLSI architecture design and implementation for digital signal processing and communication systems.

Unlike in DFEs where the output levels of the nonlinear devices are finite, in TH precoders, theoretically, the output levels of the modulo devices are infinite. Thus, it is difficult to apply look-ahead and pre-computation techniques to pipeline TH precoders, which were successfully applied to pipeline infinite-impulse response (IIR) filters and DFEs in the past. In this paper, three approaches are proposed to design high-speed TH precoders. In the first approach, the traditional block processing technique for DFEs is generalized to the design of high-speed TH precoders. In the second approach, based on the equivalent form of a TH precoder where the precoder can be viewed as an IIR filter with an input equal to the sum of the original input to the TH precoder and a finite-level compensation signal, two high-speed pipelined designs are developed. In the third approach, parallel processing techniques for fast IIR filters are generalized to the design of parallel TH precoders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303295/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633096","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Architecture Design of Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Architecture Design of Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoders","sourcePdf":"54tcsi09-gu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055161S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4303284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4303284","articleId":"4303295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303304,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

The 2.8-V capacitorless LDO voltage regulator with a power supply of 3 V was fabricated in a commercial 0.35-mum CMOS technology, consuming only 65 muA of ground current with a dropout voltage of 200 mV.

Whether in dc or ac form, photovoltaic cells provide power for systems in many applications on earth and space. Its principles of operation are therefore well understood, and circuit equivalents have been developed that accurately model the nonlinear relationship between the current and voltage of a photovoltaic cell. With the improved efficiencies of power electronics converters, it is now possible to operate photovoltaic system about its maximum power point (MPP) in order to improve the overall system efficiency. Hitherto, this problem has been tackled using tracking (MPPT) algorithms that iteratively find the point of maximum power and respond to changes in solar irradiance accordingly. A mathematical manipulation that uses the mean value theorem is presented here that provides the analytic solution of a point in a close neighborhood of the MPP. It is thoroughly proved that this point is enclosed in a ball of small radius that also contains the MPP and therefore can practically be considered as the MPP. Since the solution is analytic, no iterative schemes are necessary, and only a periodic measurement is required to adjust to changes in solar irradiance. A circuit is implemented that shows the validity of the theory and the accuracy of the solution.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.902537","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4303284/04303308.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.902537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"2054","endPage":"2060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic Solution to the Photovoltaic Maximum Power Point Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analytic Solution to the Photovoltaic Maximum Power Point Problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303308/","volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4303308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633105","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic Solution to the Photovoltaic Maximum Power Point Problem","sourcePdf":"54tcsi09-rodriguez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047268S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4303284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4303284","articleId":"4303308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4303309,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyuan Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4303284/4303309/4303309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengyuan Xu received the B.Sc. degree from the Hangzhou Normal University, China, in 1990, the M.Sc. degree from the Qufu Normal University, China, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, 1999.","From 1999 to 2000, he was a Research Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. from December 2000 to November 2001, and from December 2001 to September 2002, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher in CESAME, Universit Catholique de Louvain, Louvain, Belgium, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada, respectively. from September 2002 to September 2003, and from September 2003 to September 2004, he was a William Mong Young Researcher and an Honorary Associate Professor, respectively, both at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong.

The design of the controller is based on the stability analysis of the system using the state transition matrix over a clock cycle. It is shown that the transition matrix across the switching manifold greatly influences the system's performance, allowing the system to be stabilized by periodically altering the manifold.

The proposed amplifier eliminates the tradeoff between small Iq and large slew-rate that is imposed by the tail-current in conventional amplifier design. Push-pull output stage is introduced to enhance the output driving ability. Small dropout voltage (Vbo) with large-size pass transistor and ultra-low Iq can thus be used to minimize power loss of LDO regulator without transient-response degradation. The proposed amplifier helps to improve stability of LDO regulators without using any on-chip and off-chip compensation capacitors.

The proposed architecture is based on a low-pass SigmaDelta modulator that subsamples an intermediate frequency signal around the sampling frequency and does not require quadrature mixers. Instead, the quadrature mixing is replaced by suitably choosing the sampling instants inside the loop. Two practical circuit implementations are proposed. The first one uses separate circuitry for the I and Q paths. The second architecture introduces an innovative way to produce the I and Q outputs that is immune to path mismatch due to the sharing of all the analog circuitry for both paths. The proposed modulator may be feasible for the typical IF frequencies used in cellular base stations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Filters","Frequency","Circuits","Baseband","Computed tomography","Sampling methods","Base stations","Transmission lines","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulators","radio receivers","resonators","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsampling quadrature SigmaDelta modulator","sampling frequency","quadrature receiver","continuous-time sigma-delta modulators","radio receiver","distributed resonators","subsampling quadrature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital conversion","sigma\u2013delta ($\\Sigma \\Delta$) modulation","subsampling","transmission-line (TL) resonators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.899905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4303314/04303335.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.899905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Subsampling Quadrature - Modulator Based on Distributed Resonators for Use in Radio Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Subsampling Quadrature <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma \\Delta$</tex></formula> Modulator Based on Distributed Resonators for Use in Radio Receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303335/","volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303335/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9633086","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Subsampling Quadrature <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma \\Delta$</tex></formula> Modulator Based on Distributed Resonators for Use in Radio Receiver","sourcePdf":"54tcsii09-reekmans.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043248S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4303314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4303314","articleId":"4303335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303336,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Serrano-Gotarredona","affiliation":["Ed.

I-Pot blocks can be chained within a chip to allow for any arbitrary number of programmable bias currents. The approach only requires to provide the chip with three external pins, the use of an external current measuring instrument, and a computer. This way, once all internal I-Pots have been characterized, they can be programmed through a computer to provide any desired current bias value with very low error. The circuit block turns out to be very practical for experimenting with new circuits (specially when a large number of biases are required), testing wide ranges of biases, introducing means for current mismatch calibration, offsets compensations, etc. using a reduced number of chip pins. We show experimental results of generating bias currents with errors of 0.38% (8 bits) for currents varying from 176 muA to 19.6 pA.

Exploiting structures inherent in the problem, a dual problem is constructed for each independent memoryless channel, in which both mathematical and numerical analysis are performed.

We develop low-complexity metrics for the evaluation of the candidate tap positions in the search space as well as methods to effectively reduce the search space size. The proposed algorithms are shown to be superior over previously proposed algorithms in a wide range of channel conditions. Actually, the proposed algorithms yield, in most of the tested cases, performance identical to the optimal, prohibitively complex, tap-positioning algorithm.

In contrast to a conventional receiver, here, only knowledge of the spreading code and rough timing of the desired user is required. By investigating the code space of the multipath signals and the data vector space, a RAKE filtering vector is developed to extract the desired data from all the paths of the desired user. Our proposed technique not only exploits the characteristics of multipath propagation but also the characteristics of timing offsets that may occur in the receiver, to facilitate the application of a blind linear filter-optimization technique for robust interference suppression. Based on the RAKE filtering vector, interference rejection is implemented by using the auxiliary-vector (AV) technique. Our approach, however, effectively overcomes the sensitivity of the original AV method to multipath propagation and timing offsets. To mitigate the signal cancellation at relatively high signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINR) resulting from the estimation errors of the RAKE filtering vector, robust strategies are introduced in addition to the linear filter optimization. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4303341/04303359.pdf","startPage":"1793","endPage":"1801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blind RAKE Receiver With Robust Multiuser Interference Cancelation for DS/CDMA Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multipath channels","Robustness","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Nonlinear filters","Timing","Filtering","Vectors","RAKE receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","code division multiple access","filtering theory","interference suppression","multipath channels","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind RAKE receiver","DS/CDMA communications","robust multiuser access interference cancellation","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","spreading code","code space","multipath signals","data vector space","RAKE filtering vector","multipath propagation","timing offsets","blind linear filter-optimization technique","robust interference suppression","interference rejection","auxiliary-vector technique","signal cancellation","estimation errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind RAKE receiver","direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA)","robust interference suppression","timing offsets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Blind RAKE Receiver With Robust Multiuser Interference Cancelation for DS/CDMA Communications","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4303359/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624617","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blind RAKE Receiver With Robust Multiuser Interference Cancelation for DS/CDMA Communications","sourcePdf":"55tcomm09-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080156S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4303341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"4303341","articleId":"4303359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303360,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios S.

In contrast to previous works, where efforts were made to find a posteriori probabilities at the receiver, the BRC simply calculates the optimum weights, which depend on the channel's statistics, avoiding continuous channel estimation, and thus, it significantly reduces the system's complexity. In nonidentical multipath fading channels with power delay profile (PDP), the BRC receiver performs between maximal ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC), and keeps its performance comparable - and in some cases superior - to that of generalized selection combining, while for large values of the decay factor, it approaches MRC. Moreover, in the important practical case of exponential PDP - common in RAKE receivers modeling and adopted for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System spatial channel modeling by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute-3GPP - the optimum weights can be accurately approximated by simple elementary functions. Furthermore, it is proved that the utilization of these weights ensures an error performance improvement over EGC for arbitrary PDPs. The proposed BRC receiver can be efficiently applied in wireless wideband communication systems, where a large number of diversity branches exists, due to the strong multipath effects.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904378","startPage":"1725","endPage":"1735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4303341/04303360.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Ratio Combining (BRC): An Optimum Diversity Receiver for Coherent Detection With Unknown Fading Amplitudes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Blind Ratio Combining (BRC): An Optimum Diversity Receiver for Coherent Detection With Unknown Fading Amplitudes","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","volume":"55","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303360/","accessionNumber":"9624618","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303360/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Ratio Combining (BRC): An Optimum Diversity Receiver for Coherent Detection With Unknown Fading Amplitudes","sourcePdf":"55tcomm09-lioumpas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072299S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4303341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4303341","articleId":"4303360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303361,"authors":[{"name":"Trung Thanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Trung Thanh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38184426800"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4303361","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Decoding","Time domain analysis","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Signal representations","Viterbi algorithm","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis shaping","PAR reduction","OFDM systems","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","decoding metrics","sequential decoding","frequency-domain metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) reduction","trellis shaping"]}],"abstract":"The application of trellis shaping was proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals.

Information theories have shown that using multiple nodes to simultaneously relay a message can improve the capacity of source-to-destination communications. In this paper, we propose new relaying schemes for MIMO relay networks. The major concept behind the proposed schemes is to transform each of the MIMO relay channels into an equivalent triangular channel with positive real diagonal entries. By doing so, the resultant MIMO relay channel can simultaneously offer both distributed array gain (diversity gain obtained among relay nodes) and intranode array gain (diversity gain realized by multiple antennas of individual relay node) while maintaining the maximum spatial multiplexing gain (number of parallel data pipes). Based on this concept, three relaying schemes are derived that perform QR decomposition and phase control. Numerical results confirm that at least one of the proposed schemes outperforms the amplify-and-forward and the zero-forcing relaying schemes under various conditions. Moreover, we show that ratios of noise power level at relay and destination node have a great impact on capacities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4303341/04303364.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaying Schemes Using Matrix Triangularization for MIMO Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Wireless networks","Antenna arrays","Diversity methods","Wireless communication","Information theory","Phase control","Noise level","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-forcing relaying scheme","amplify-and-forward scheme","phase control","QR decomposition","maximum spatial multiplexing gain","intranode array gain","distributed array gain","equivalent triangular channel","MIMO relay networks","source-to-destination communications","information theory","multiple antennas","wireless communication systems","MIMO wireless networks","matrix triangularization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed array gain","intranode array gain","phase control","QR decomposition","spatial multiplexing gain","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Relaying Schemes Using Matrix Triangularization for MIMO Wireless Networks","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4303364/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624621","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaying Schemes Using Matrix Triangularization for MIMO Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"55tcomm09-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055005S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4303341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4303341","articleId":"4303364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4303366,"authors":[{"name":"Peter J.

However, for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, this requires intensive traffic overheads for reporting channel state information on all subcarriers to the transmitter. In this paper, we consider an adaptive modulation and coding scheme for bit-interleaved coded OFDM with reduced feedback information satisfying a specified quality of service level. We propose a rate adaptation scheme, which utilizes the estimated bit error rate for supportable transmission rates. In this scheme, a user equipment chooses a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level, which can provide the maximum spectral efficiency based on one OFDM symbol rather than on all subchannels. Then the user needs to send back only the selected MCS level index. The proposed scheme does not require the water-filling procedure, and the amount of the feedback information reduces to a single integer value irrespective of the number of subcarriers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the system complexity while minimizing the performance loss compared to the optimum water-filling scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4303341/04303368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303341","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Reduced Feedback Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Reduced Feedback Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624625","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303368/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Reduced Feedback Information","sourcePdf":"55tcomm09-sung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063991S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4303341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4303341","articleId":"4303368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4303369,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tomasin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4303341/4303369/4303369-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Tomasin (S\u203200\u2013M\u203202) received the Laurea and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunications engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, where he is currently with the Department of Information Engineering.","During 1999\u20132000, he was on leave at the IBM Research Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland, where he was engaged in research on signal processing for magnetic recording systems.

In this paper, we present a new block CDMA (B-CDMA) system where a single cyclic prefix (CP) is used at the end of each spread block. This provides a higher spectral efficiency with respect to existing schemes. By observing that complete orthogonality among users is achievable only for half-loaded systems on dispersive channels, we introduce new criteria for the design of spreading and despreading sequences, which aim at minimizing the mean-square error at the output of the despreader. For the equalization of the received signal, we propose an iterative block decision feedback equalizer, which iterates between equalization and decoding. Equalization filters are designed to minimize the mean-square error and take into account the residual interference due to the nonorthogonality of the spreading sequences. The performance of B-CDMA is evaluated in an uplink wireless scenario and compared to existing CDMA schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Resilient Block-Spreading CDMA With Minimum-MAI Sequence Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4303341/04303369.pdf","startPage":"1783","endPage":"1792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.904398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Resilient Block-Spreading CDMA With Minimum-MAI Sequence Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4303369/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624626","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Resilient Block-Spreading CDMA With Minimum-MAI Sequence Design","sourcePdf":"55tcomm09-tomasin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10695S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4303341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4303341","articleId":"4303369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303371,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhou","affiliation":["Communication Department, Groupe des Ecoles T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/Ecole Nationale Suprieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (GET/ENST), Bretagne Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, CNRS TAMCIC (UMR 2872) Research Laboratory, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37269475500"},{"name":"Raphael Le Bidan","affiliation":["Communication Department, Groupe des Ecoles T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/Ecole Nationale Suprieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (GET/ENST), Bretagne Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, CNRS TAMCIC (UMR 2872) Research Laboratory, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Le Bidan","id":"37281696600"},{"name":"Ramesh Pyndiah","affiliation":["Communication Department, Groupe des Ecoles T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/Ecole Nationale Suprieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (GET/ENST), Bretagne Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, CNRS TAMCIC (UMR 2872) Research Laboratory, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Pyndiah","id":"37269802500"},{"name":"Andre Goalic","affiliation":["Communication Department, Groupe des Ecoles T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/Ecole Nationale Suprieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (GET/ENST), Bretagne Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, CNRS TAMCIC (UMR 2872) Research Laboratory, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Goalic","id":"37282519400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4303371","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":454},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","Product codes","Convolutional codes","Forward error correction","Additive white noise","Digital communication","Concatenated codes","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","Gaussian noise","Reed-Solomon codes","turbo codes","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity decoder","additive white Gaussian noise","binary transmission","single-error-correcting Reed-Solomon code","block turbo codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block turbo codes (BTC)","Reed--Solomon codes","product codes"]}],"abstract":"This letter considers high-rate block turbo codes (BTC) obtained by concatenation of two single-error-correcting Reed-Solomon (RS) constituent codes.

Our proposed system has the ability to identify faulty components or modules in an analog circuit by analyzing its impulse response. In this approach, the circuit is divided into modules, which, in turn, are divided into smaller submodules successively. At each level, where a module is divided into submodules, a neural network is trained to identify the submodule that inherits the fault of interest from the parent module. This procedure finds the faulty component or module of any desirable size in an analog circuit by consecutive divisions of modules as many times as necessary. Our proposed approach has three advantages over the traditional neural-network-based diagnostic systems, which directly look for faulty components in the entire circuit. First, the performance of the modular systems is reliable and robust independent of the circuit size and can successfully classify similar fault classes with a significant overlap in the feature space where the traditional approach completely fails. Second, the modular approach requires significantly smaller neural network architectures, leading to much more efficient training. Third, for large real circuit boards, our diagnostic system proceeds to systematically reduce the size of the faulty modules until it is feasible to replace it.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.904549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4303372/04303378.pdf","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.904549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modular Fault-Diagnostic System for Analog Electronic Circuits Using Neural Networks With Wavelet Transform as a Preprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303378/","displayDocTitle":"A Modular Fault-Diagnostic System for Analog Electronic Circuits Using Neural Networks With Wavelet Transform as a Preprocessor","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633000","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303378/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modular Fault-Diagnostic System for Analog Electronic Circuits Using Neural Networks With Wavelet Transform as a Preprocessor","sourcePdf":"56tim05-aminian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092739S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4303389,"authors":[{"name":"Carmine Ciofi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Fisica della Materia e Tecnologie Fisiche Avanzate, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4303372/4303389/4303389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carmine Ciofi (M'00) was born in Cosenza, Italy, in 1965.

This approximation leads to the definition of the phasor state vector, which contains not only the estimate of the dynamic phasor but the estimates of its derivatives as well.

This paper presents a comparison relating two different vision system architectures. The first one implements a logarithmic complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)/active pixel sensor interfaced to a microprocessor, where all computations are carried out. The second involves a CMOS sensor including analog processors allowing on-chip image processing. An external microprocessor is used to control the on-chip data flow and integrated operators. We have designed two vision systems as proof-of-concept. The comparison is related to image processing computation time, processing reliability, programmability, precision, bandwidth, and subsequent stages of computations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4303372/04303400.pdf","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.895671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.895671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Processing Vision Systems: Standard Image Sensors Versus Retinas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Machine vision","Image sensors","Retina","CMOS image sensors","Intelligent sensors","Microprocessors","Computational complexity","Computer vision","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","computational complexity","computer vision","digital signal processing chips","intelligent sensors","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor focal plan","low-level image processing","computer vision algorithms","computational complexity reduction","retina","standard image sensors","image processing vision systems","SOC","processing reliability","image processing computation time","integrated operators","on-chip data flow control","external microprocessor","on chip image processing","analog processors","CMOS sensor","microprocessor interface","active pixel sensor","logarithmic complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensor","external circuits","data flow exchange reduction","smart sensor device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS/APS sensors","image processing","instrumentation","smart sensors (retinas)","system-on-chip (SoC)","vision systems architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Processing Vision Systems: Standard Image Sensors Versus Retinas","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4303400/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633016","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Processing Vision Systems: Standard Image Sensors Versus Retinas","sourcePdf":"56tim05-elouardi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082207S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303404,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Grimaldi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4303372/4303404/4303404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Domenico Grimaldi (M'95) received the Dr. Ing. degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering from the University of Naples, Naples, Italy, in 1979.","After working as an independent consultant, he joined the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Arcavacata di Rende, Italy, in the 1990s, where he is currently an Associate Professor of electronic measurement.

After identification of the modulation type, the method automatically estimates some parameters characterizing the modulation. To evaluate the method performance, several simulations have been carried out in different operating conditions that should be particularly critical by varying the values of signal- to-noise ratio and the main parameters of each identifiable modulation. To assess the advantages, comparison with other classification methods has been given. To validate the assumption that is made, experimental tests have been performed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic Digital Modulation Classifier for Measurement on Telecommunication Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.895675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4303372/04303404.pdf","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.895675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic Digital Modulation Classifier for Measurement on Telecommunication Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4303404/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic Digital Modulation Classifier for Measurement on Telecommunication Networks","sourcePdf":"56tim05-grimaldi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076877S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303414,"authors":[{"name":"Sukumar Kamalasadan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Computer Technology, University of West Florida, Pensacola, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4303372/4303414/4303414-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sukumar Kamalasadan (S'01\u2013M'05) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, in 2004, the M.Eng. degree in electrical power systems management from Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, in 1999, and the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics from the University of Calicut, Malappuram, India, in 1991.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Engineering and Computer Technology, University of West Florida (UWF), Pensacola.

Updating of the RBFNN width, center, and weight characteristics is performed such that error reduction and improved tracking accuracy are accomplished. The RBFNN architecture adapts its centers and radii and tunes the relevant parameters dynamically. These adaptations effectively address the issues that are related to initial error and dimensional growth that are inherent in static NN design. The strength of the proposed scheme is in its ability to perform effectively, even when the plant mode swings and functional changes occur. Theoretical results are validated by simulation studies based on a nonlinear single-link flexible robotic manipulator position tracking of changing reference pattern. Compared to single and multiple fuzzy reference adaptive control approaches, the proposed intelligent controller produced better tracking with reduced tracking error in the event of functional changes and is capable of delivering plant output to track the reference precisely.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.895674","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4303372/04303414.pdf","startPage":"1786","endPage":"1796","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.895674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Parallel Adaptive Controller for Dynamic System Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Parallel Adaptive Controller for Dynamic System Control","volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633030","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303414/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Parallel Adaptive Controller for Dynamic System Control","sourcePdf":"56tim05-kamalasadan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064437S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4303417,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir A.

In-drilling alignment (IDA) was previously suggested to improve downhole navigation performance when utilizing an inertial navigation system (INS). It was shown that the IDA process enhances the ability to estimate INS bias and drift errors and, particularly, their azimuth-related components. It was suggested that this improvement was related to a better observability that is achieved with the help of the induced dynamics during the IDA phase. The observability of a system is an important parameter that facilitates the estimation of the state parameters and the achievable accuracy of the system. However, observability models that are related to the IDA technique are lacking. This paper presents observability modeling of the newly suggested IDA process to aid horizontal drilling. The presented methodology clearly demonstrates that an induced motion during the IDA process increases system observability and converts the azimuth angle into an observable system state. Adequate system modeling profoundly influences the overall system observability. The utilization of the vertical damped model with a reduced state order is preferable for a faster and more efficient performance due to a decreased computational load but remains inferior when compared to a full system model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9633050","htmlLink":"/document/4303434/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Observability During In-Drilling Alignment for Horizontal Directional Drilling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Observability During In-Drilling Alignment for Horizontal Directional Drilling","sourcePdf":"56tim05-pecht.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090033S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4303444,"authors":[{"name":"Steven R.

A radial basis function (RBF)-ANN model is developed for S-parameters and equivalent circuit parameters (ECPs) of MESFETs. The training and testing data for these models are obtained from the measured two-port scattering parameters and extracted ECPs of a 0.25 times 200 mum (4 times 50 mum) gallium arsenide MESFET. A four- input eight-output ANN is used to model the S-parameters of a microwave MESFET versus bias, temperature, and frequency, and a three-input eight-output ANN is used to model the ECPs of a microwave MESFET versus bias and temperature. Comparisons of measured and modeled data are presented, and the results show very good agreement. The average relative errors using the RBF-ANN models for the S-parameters and ECPs were 0.81% and 0.77%, respectively, which both represent about 60% reduction in error when compared to backpropagation ANN models of similar parameters of the same device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4303451/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633066","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Small-Signal Modeling of Microwave MESFETs Using RBF-ANNs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Signal Modeling of Microwave MESFETs Using RBF-ANNs","sourcePdf":"56tim05-weatherspoon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042362S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4303372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4303372","articleId":"4303451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4303474,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Espinoza","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, K.U.

This multi-input, multi-output staged separation process is strongly interactive, as determined by the singular value decomposition of a linear dynamic model of the system. Process dynamics associated with the low-gain direction are critical to the design of high-performance controllers for high-purity distillation but are difficult to estimate from conventional experimental test signals for identification. As a result, high-purity distillation columns are considered challenging cases for multivariable system identification and robust control system design. High-purity distillation is a challenging process application for system identification because of its nonlinear and strongly interactive dynamics. This article has described several constrained-optimization-based formulations for multisine input signal design that allow users to simultaneously specify the essential frequency- and time-domain properties of these signals. Because constraints are explicitly part of the design procedure, the approach is useful for accomplishing plant-friendly identification testing in the process industries. The problem formulations were evaluated for a highly nonlinear methanol-ethanol distillation column. Introducing directional sinusoids in the multisine signal, applying a closed-loop signal design, and minimizing an objective function based on Weyl's theorem enhanced the information content of the low-gain direction in the identification experiment.","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2007.904650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/4303457/04303476.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2007.904650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Purity Distillation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303476/","displayDocTitle":"High-Purity Distillation","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9656032","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303476/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Purity Distillation","sourcePdf":"272007-Daniel-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143409S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"4303457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4303457","articleId":"4303476","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303507,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The friction parameters, as well as the torque sensor gain and offset, are identified and used in the control system, and the position tracking error reduction is demonstrated with experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303507/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9804743","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303507/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control of Modular Robot with Parameter Estimation Using Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Modular Robot with Parameter Estimation Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063549S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4303507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4303511,"authors":[{"name":"David Brandt","affiliation":["Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Brandt","id":"37719470800"},{"name":"David Johan Christensen","affiliation":["Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"David Johan","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37543509000"},{"name":"Henrik Hautop Lund","affiliation":["Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Henrik Hautop","lastName":"Lund","id":"37272835200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4303511","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robotic assembly","Robotics and automation","Manipulators","Belts","Service robots","Morphology","Legged locomotion","Mechatronics","Shape","Bones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged locomotion","manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular self reconfigurable robot","functional adaptation","ATRON system","object manipulation","anatomical building block","traditional fixed morphology robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modular","robot","locomotion","manipulation","self-recon\u00bfguration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303511","abstract":"Traditional fixed morphology robots are limited to purely functional adaptation and thereby to a limited range of applications.

This paper documents and discusses the application versatility of self-reconfigurable robots in general and of the ATRON system in particular. We present a range of different self-reconfigurable robots assembled from the ATRON base module. The robot's ability includes locomotion (snake, car, and walker), manipulation of objects (serial manipulator, conveyer belt) and autonomous change of functionality and shape (locomotion configurations, many-module shape-change). We also demonstrate the structure of simple anatomical building blocks (bones, muscles, etc.) which we envision can be assembled into more complex robots of future miniaturized modules.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303511","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04303511.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATRON Robots: Versatility from Self-Reconfigurable Modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ATRON Robots: Versatility from Self-Reconfigurable Modules","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9804973","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303511/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303511/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATRON Robots: Versatility from Self-Reconfigurable Modules","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045025S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4303511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4303554,"authors":[{"name":"Siquan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Siquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37713969100"},{"name":"Tiequn Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Tiequn","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535118100"},{"name":"Hefa Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Guangzhou Civil Aviation College, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Hefa","lastName":"Yang","id":"37714339900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4303554","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Electrical capacitance tomography","Artificial neural networks","Numerical models","Eddy current testing","Signal processing","Nondestructive testing","Iterative algorithms","Iterative methods","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cracks","eddy current testing","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets","nondestructive testing","optimisation","shapes (structures)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural crack shapes reconstruction","eddy current testing signals","nondestructive testing technique","iterative inversion algorithms","metaheuristics-based optimization method","artificial neural network forward scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy current testing","natural crack reconstruction","artificial neural networks","optimization method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4303554","abstract":"This paper presents work on a natural crack identification problem from eddy current testing (ECT) signals. ECT is a widely used in-service nondestructive testing (NDT) technique. A crucial problem in ECT is to inverse flaw profile from testing signals. Iterative inversion algorithms are commonly used to solve this problem. Typical iterative inversion approaches use a numerical forward model to predict the measurement signal from a given defect profile. But the use of numerical models is computationally intensive. In this study, the reconstruction of natural crack shapes from the ECT signals is realized by utilizing artificial neural networks as the forward solver and applying a metaheuristics-based optimization method. The crack is successfully reconstructed that verified both the efficiency of the artificial neural network forward scheme and the feasibility of the metaheuristics-based inversion method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303554","startPage":"276","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04303554.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Natural Crack Shapes from the ECT Signals by Using an Artificial Neural Networks Forward Model and an Optimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303554/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Natural Crack Shapes from the ECT Signals by Using an Artificial Neural Networks Forward Model and an Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303554/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9804956","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Natural Crack Shapes from the ECT Signals by Using an Artificial Neural Networks Forward Model and an Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065958S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4303554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4303563,"authors":[{"name":"Lu-Fang Gao","affiliation":["School of Automobile Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Lu-Fang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37711085200"},{"name":"Yu-Xian Gai","affiliation":["School of Automobile Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Xian","lastName":"Gai","id":"37410453900"},{"name":"Sheng Fu","affiliation":["School of Automobile Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Fu","id":"37711473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4303563","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"abstract":"This paper proposes a method of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for an autonomous mobile robot in an indoor environment using binocular stereo vision systems.

Convergence of particles to the optimum solution is a primary and traditional requirement, however, this is achieved only after all the solutions space has been covered and evaluated. In this work, the focus is directed towards maintaining sufficient divergence of particles in multi-modal problems, by developing an alternative social interaction scheme among the swarm members.

Because of their complexity, recent research has turned to genetic algorithms to address such problems. Although genetic algorithms have been proven to facilitate the entire space search, they lack in fine-tuning capability for obtaining the global optimum. Therefore, in this study a hybrid genetic algorithm was developed for optimization. Scheduling problems often involve more than one criterion and therefore require multicriteria analysis. Therefore a multicriteria flowshop scheduling problem with setup times is considered. The objective function of the problem is minimization of the weighted sum of total completion time, makespan, maximum tardiness and maximum earliness. An integer programming model is developed for the problem which belongs to NP-hard class.

The swimming robots, like robotic fish and robotic dolphin, consist of a sequence of propulsive modules in series, which propels itself via undulatory/oscillatory locomotion and performs up-and-down motion by artificial pectoral fins. Mechanically, this robotic configuration is simply considered as an open, tree-structured multi-body system. The expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and momentums on the moving modules are based on quasi-steady hydrodynamics and oscillatory foil theory, and these are coupled with kinematic and dynamic analyses to derive complete dynamic equations in a form suited for controller design and computer simulation. The matching results between simulation with experimental results on a four-link, multi-mode robotic fish show good agreement, which partially demonstrates the validity of the proposed model and the potential of its use for other flexible links based robots.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303741","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1327","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04303741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Modeling of Multi-link Swimming Robot Capable of 3-D Motion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Marine animals","Hydrodynamics","Dolphins","Propulsion","Kinematics","Equations","Force control","Computer simulation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","mobile robots","robot dynamics","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic modeling","multilink swimming robot","flexible multilink robots","multibody dynamics","robotic fish","robotic dolphin","artificial pectoral fins","oscillatory locomotion","hydrodynamic forces","quasisteady hydrodynamics","kinematic-dynamic analyses","controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic modeling","underwater robot","multi-body dynamics","Schiehlen method","multi-link robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4303741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Modeling of Multi-link Swimming Robot Capable of 3-D Motion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4303741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9804823","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Modeling of Multi-link Swimming Robot Capable of 3-D Motion","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063467S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4303741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4303816,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin Sitte","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering and Data Communications, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Sitte","id":"37269000000"},{"name":"Petra Winzer","affiliation":["Department of Product Safety and Quality, Bergische University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Winzer","id":"37412593600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4303816","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Robot vision systems","Machine vision","Robotics and automation","Orbital robotics","Image sensors","Robot sensing systems","Mechatronics","Application software","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","robot vision","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot vision systems","innovative on-board vision system","small commercial minirobot","demand compliant design method","testing design methods","mechatronic systems","DeCoDe method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous robots","robot vision","Design space","Design methodology","Requirement Management"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we use the design of an innovative on-board vision system for a small commercial minirobotto demonstrate the application of a demand compliant design (DeCoDe) method.

This novel proposed control scheme is initially applied to the independent control of the PAM manipulator joint angle position. Proposed pole placement controller utilizes a low order linear approximation of the PAM manipulator ARX model, whose parameters are estimated online from past input and output values by RLS system identification algorithm. Furthermore, parametric values of ARX model are optimized by a modified genetic algorithm (MGA). This superb combination between MGA and self-tuning pole placement controller is developed for tracking the joint angle position of the prototype 2-axes PAM manipulator. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed control scheme.

To deal with constrained multiobjective optimization problems, the constrained AlS-based multiobjective optimization algorithm is developed by integrating a proposed constraint-handling technique with the unconstrained AIS-based multiobjective optimization algorithm named MOAIS (Xiao and Zu, 2006). We propose the constraint-handling technique by extending a single-objective constraint-handling technique called stochastic ranking (Runarsson and Yao, 2000) to multiobjective optimization process. Two scenarios of the multiobjective version of stochastic ranking are suggested. Thereafter, we develop the constrained MOAIS named MOAIS+SR by integrating the two scenarios with MOAIS. A comparative study is performed quantitatively to assess the performance of MOAIS+SR on a constrained test function suite called CTP test problems. In the comparative study, MOAIS+SR is compared against two other constrained multiobjective algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed multiobjective stochastic ranking outperforms the constrained-dominance principle (Deb et al., 2000) in handling constraints. Furthermore, we show that the proposed MOAIS+SR achieves the best overall performance among the three algorithms under consideration on the CTP test problems. This study demonstrates that the proposed MOAIS+SR is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art algorithms in constrained multiobjective optimization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Artificial immune systems","Testing","Stochastic processes","Mechatronics","Automation","Industrial engineering","Educational institutions","Performance evaluation","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","constraint handling","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained multiobjective optimization","artificial immune system","single-objective constraint-handling","stochastic ranking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constrained Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","Artificial Immune Systems","Constraint-handling technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4304060","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304060","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04304060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304060","startPage":"3122","endPage":"3127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Artificial Immune Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Artificial Immune Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304060/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4304060/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9811543","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Artificial Immune Systems","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048537S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4304060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4304062,"authors":[{"name":"Hongda Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Hongda","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085348093"},{"name":"Zhongli Ma","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhongli","lastName":"Ma","id":"37711536600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4304062","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4304062","abstract":"In order to disguise and hide themselves better, vessels and submarines are equipped with degaussing windings. But, with the development of warship degaussing technology, more and more degaussing coils are being adopted.

In order to solve this problem, the improved poly-population particle swarm algorithm is applied to compress the search space, which can improve the probability of searching global optimization solution. This method is applied to adjust some vessel degaussing system. Simulation results show that this algorithm has more advantages than others, in terms of minimizing the degaussing magnetic field characteristic RMS value (min-RM) and peak value (min-PM), and that this method can be used to optimize one or more parameters relating to the vessel or submarine's magnetic field characteristics, so the vessel or submarine degaussing system is calibrated to an optimal state, and the vessel or submarine's magnetic safety is ensured. Furthermore, this optimization has many advantages, such as intuitional algorithm, simple programming, high calculating speed, etc., which makes easy collaborating multi-computer and applying it to

a primal-dual neural network based on linear variational inequalities (LVI) is presented for online repetitive motion planning of kinematically redundant manipulators. To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited. In addition, the physical constraints such as joint limits and joint velocity limits are incorporated into the problem formulation of such a scheme. The scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. As a QP real-time solver, the LVI-based primal-dual neural network is designed based on the QP-LVI conversion and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. With simple piecewise-linear dynamics and global (exponential) convergence to optimal solutions, it can handle general QP and linear programming (LP) problems in the same inverse-free manner. The repetitive motion planning scheme and the LVI-based primal-dual neural network are simulated based on PA 10 robot manipulator with effectiveness demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304063","startPage":"3138","endPage":"3143","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04304063.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repetitive Motion Planning of Kinematically Redundant Manipulators Using LVI-based Primal-Dual Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304063/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Repetitive Motion Planning of Kinematically Redundant Manipulators Using LVI-based Primal-Dual Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4304063/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9811544","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetitive Motion Planning of Kinematically Redundant Manipulators Using LVI-based Primal-Dual Neural Network","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095229S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4304063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4304083,"authors":[{"name":"Changhai Ru","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Harbin, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Changhai","lastName":"Ru","id":"37271411100"},{"name":"Chun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Harbin, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37717066400"},{"name":"Xiufen Ye","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Harbin, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiufen","lastName":"Ye","id":"37288428300"},{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Harbin, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4304083","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"Piezoelectric actuators are becoming increasingly important in such fields as vibration control, precision positioning, acoustics and sonar, and it is mainly driven by voltage in practical application. The amplifier driven by voltage has good stability and static characteristic, but in high speed motion conditions, we have to sacrifice frequency response bandwidth to ensure stability, so its closed loop frequency response bandwidth is relatively low.

A high efficiency class D power amplifier is presented to drive the piezoelectric load, polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF) ultrasonic transducer of Audio Beam, between 20 kHz and 60 kHz. The class D amplifier is composed of power MOSFETS, type IRFU2407, in a full H-Bridge configuration driven by HIPxxxxA circuits in bootstrap mode. The specific nature of the problem comes from the fact that the transducer loaded is mostly capacitive around the resonant frequency. The insertion of two appropriate inductors in front of the load introduced an efficient solution to the problem due to the reactance matching and resonance. In the end, the experiment of the realized system testified that the class-D amplifier designed is able to drive the ultrasonic transducer with extreme high efficiency and high power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Ultrasonic transducers","High power amplifiers","MOSFETs","Circuits","Piezoelectric transducers","Resonant frequency","Inductors","Resonance","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier","audio beam system","ultrasonic transducer","polyvinylidene fluoride","resonant frequency","reactance matching","capacitive load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["class D amplifier","audio beam","amplifier for capacitive load"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304121","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4303487/4303488/04304121.pdf","startPage":"3469","endPage":"3474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4303488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2007.4304121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class D Power Amplifier for Audio Beam System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4304121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Class D Power Amplifier for Audio Beam System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304121/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4304121/","accessionNumber":"9811558","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class D Power Amplifier for Audio Beam System","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04089S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4304121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4304135,"authors":[{"name":"Jinjun Rao","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Rao","id":"37411040600"},{"name":"Zhenbang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhenbang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37301758400"},{"name":"Zhen Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37405775500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0827-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0828-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"4304135","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Robots","Computational fluid dynamics","Automatic control","Costs","Payloads","Digital simulation","Mathematical model","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","motion measurement","perturbation theory","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","flight motion model parameter identification","subminiature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle","low-altitude exploration applications","robotic SUAV","rectilinear trim flight","small perturbation theory","linear parametric model","flight data measurement system","model verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subminiature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle","Genetic algorithm","Parameter Identification","flight motion modeling","data fusion"]}],"abstract":"Subminiature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) present an enormous potential for low-altitude exploration applications.

Put all the feature points into BP neural networks, adopts area matching arithmetic to recognize driver's alertness level, fatigue monitor system can recognize that the driver is in decreased alertness state when he/she yawns more times than normal, then the system gives off alarm signal, and awakes the driver; the system can also recognize that the driver is in drowsy state when driver's eyes blink frequency is lower than standard value, then it gives sharp alarm signal to wake the driver up. It has the characteristic of real time, accuracy. The detection performance of the system was evaluated in laboratory tests and actual driving tests using the alertness index as the criterion.

If only one faulty line detection method is used, faulty information is analyzed and used partially which is not enough for faulty line detection; and there are different conditions for every method. In order to compensate the shortcoming of one method, a fuse method is used to ensure the reliability of the line detection result. First the data set was preprocessed by Rough Set theory, so the redundancy information was thrown off, and the simplified data set was obtained. Second the neural network was designed and trained by the simplified data set. At last, fusing those detection results, a better faulty line detection result was reached. Simulation results by EMTP show that the method of the faulty line detection is valid and the method has some study value and will be used in distribution

Vision and Neural Network to Glue Dispenser Route Inspection","abstract":"Inspection system design based upon the dispenser route is the focus in this article. The defects of the dispenser route such as deformation, offset, gap, and broken glue may affect the quality of production and efficiency. An automatic dispenser route inspection system in combination the techniques of back-propagation neural (BPN) network with computer vision is developed. The inspection system includes computer vision (image acquisition, binarization, dilation, erosion, Sobel operator, thinning and extraction features), positioning, and inspection. The images are acquired and then preprocessed to extract the features (coordinates of edge) of interest for inspections. Before dispensing, positioning process of the dispenser system is significant. A simple method of positioning can achieve the positioning accuracy in an allowable range is introduced. Thus, the cause-and-effect failure problem due to inaccurate positioning of the dispenser system needs not considered so that it will not influence the investigation of other factors, in particular the needle's condition. Extracting features of the captured image through a series of image processing procedures are evaluated. By checking the number of the searched pixels of the boundary of the dispenser route compared to the edge number of a uniform route, failure can be determined. For further diagnosis, six sets of parameters including the average width and its standard deviation(SD) of the dispenser route, average offset and its SD, and the average of deviation between the neighboring points on the left and right sides are designed as the input units in the input layer of a three-layer neural network. After training with amount of experimental patterns, the recognition rate of the neural network system is able to achieve 96.9 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304195/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9805118","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4304195/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Apply Computer Vision and Neural Network to Glue Dispenser Route Inspection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apply Computer Vision and Neural Network to Glue Dispenser Route Inspection","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA-00-707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061816S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4303487","isNumber":"4303488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4303487","xplore-issue":"4303488","articleId":"4304195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4304248,"authors":[{"name":"Robert H.

The system will disconnect from the utility during large events (i.e. faults, voltage collapses), but may also intentionally disconnect when the quality of power from the grid falls below certain standards. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the project more financially attractive.

This paper describes the results of recent research into the use of neural networks to provide detection of the onset of operational failure in such devices. After a preliminary exploration revealed the shortcomings of more common pattern recognition methods, such as limit checking, a posteriori Bayesian methods, and even principal component analysis, it is shown that certain types of neural networks are up to the task. The results from simulations will show the effectiveness neural network techniques in detecting the onset of the failure. These techniques will then be demonstrated on data from a real-world system and the results presented.","doi":"10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304274","pdfPath":"/iel5/4304210/4304211/04304274.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4304211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Neural Networks to Detect Failure Onset in Complex Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using Neural Networks to Detect Failure Onset in Complex Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9800910","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4304274/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Neural Networks to Detect Failure Onset in Complex Systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SYSOSE-00-63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073228S","chronDate":"16-18 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4304210","isNumber":"4304211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4304210","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4304211","articleId":"4304274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4304275,"authors":[{"name":"David Akopian","affiliation":["University of Texas, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Akopian","id":"37266784500"},{"name":"Paul Ybarra","affiliation":["University of Texas-San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Ybarra","id":"37706155500"},{"name":"C.

While extensive research on filterbank design has been conducted in the past, the proposed approach will address filterbank design specifically tailored for the required class of signals. The paper presents new filterbank classes and their optimization methods. The general class of periodically time varying filters discussed allows orthogonality to be preserved, which is good for algorithms, while simultaneously reducing the required bandwidth, which is good for compression. Although not discussed in this paper, extensions of these filters allow us to achieve two desirable features at the same time: (a) orthogonality of the transformations and (b) linear-phase property of the filters. Conventional orthogonal two-band filterbanks cannot have both features. The designed filterbanks are parametric and can be optimized for signal-adapted operation. We present an optimization approach for constructed filterbanks by a backpropagation method.","doi":"10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304275","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4304210/4304211/04304275.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4304211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Time-Varying Two-Band Filterbanks for Wavelet Transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4304275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4304275/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Time-Varying Two-Band Filterbanks for Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9800928","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4304275/","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Time-Varying Two-Band Filterbanks for Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SYSOSE-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095729S","chronDate":"16-18 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4304210","isNumber":"4304211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4304210","xplore-issue":"4304211","articleId":"4304275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4304302,"authors":[{"name":"Sos S.

Photogenerated holes charge the QDs, and subsequently, change the amount of current flowing through the channel by screening the internal gate field. The photoconductive gain associated with this process makes the structure extremely sensitive to light of the appropriate wavelength. We investigate the charge storage and resulting persistent photoconductivity by performing time-resolved measurements of the channel current and of the photoluminescence emitted from the QDs under laser illumination. In addition, we characterize the response of the detector, and investigate sources of photogenerated signals by using the Poisson statistics of laser light.

It also exhibits a linear response, and detects photons absorbed in its dedicated absorption layer with an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of up to (68 plusmn18)%.

SPADs implemented in planar technology compatible with CMOS circuits offer typical advantages of microelectronic devices (small size, ruggedness, low voltage, low power, etc.). Furthermore, they have inherently higher photon detection efficiency, since they do not rely on electron emission in vacuum from a photocathode as do PMTs, but instead on the internal photoelectric effect. However, PMTs offer much wider sensitive area, which greatly simplifies the design of optical systems; they also attain remarkable performance at high counting rate, and offer picosecond timing resolution with microchannel plate models. In order to make SPAD detectors more competitive in a broader range of SPC and TCSPC applications, it is necessary to face several issues in the semiconductor device design and technology. Such issues will be discussed in the context of the two possible approaches to such a challenge: employing a standard industrial high-voltage CMOS technology or developing a dedicated CMOS-compatible technology. Advances recently attained in the development of SPAD detectors will be outlined and discussed with reference to both single-element detectors and integrated detector arrays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2007","publicationDate":"July-aug. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305219/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9629881","volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Progress in Silicon Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress in Silicon Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes","sourcePdf":"13jstqe04-ghioni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10503S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4301403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"4301403","articleId":"4305219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305222,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Ivkovic","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Ivkovic","id":"38242245800"},{"name":"Ivan Djordjevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Djordjevic","id":"37277052600"},{"name":"Predrag M.

Our approach combines the instanton method from statistical mechanics to model far tails of the pdfs, with numerical simulations to refine the middle part of the pdfs.

The original problem statement based on the minimization of signed-power-of-two (SPT) terms has been reformulated to account for the sharable adders. The minimization of common SPT (CSPT) terms that were considered in our proposed algorithm addresses the optimization of the reusability of adders for two major types of common subexpressions, together with the minimization of adders that are needed for the spare SPT terms. The coefficient set is synthesized in two stages. In the first stage, CSPT terms in the vicinity of the scaled and rounded canonical signed digit (CSD) coefficients are allocated to obtain a CSD coefficient set, with the total number of CSPT terms not exceeding the initial coefficient set. The balanced normalized peak ripple magnitude due to the quantization error is fulfilled in the second stage by a local search method. The algorithm uses a common-subexpression-based hamming weight pyramid to seek for low-cost candidate coefficients with preferential consideration of shared common subexpressions. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of synthesizing FIR filters with the least CSPT terms compared with existing filter synthesis algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Low-Complexity FIR Filters Based on Signed-Powers-of-Two Coefficients With Reusable Common Subexpressions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2007.895615","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4305238/04305245.pdf","startPage":"1898","endPage":"1907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2007.895615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Low-Complexity FIR Filters Based on Signed-Powers-of-Two Coefficients With Reusable Common Subexpressions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305245/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633365","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Low-Complexity FIR Filters Based on Signed-Powers-of-Two Coefficients With Reusable Common Subexpressions","sourcePdf":"26tcad10-fxu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083788S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4305238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4305238","articleId":"4305245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305249,"authors":[{"name":"Kunhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4305238/4305249/4305249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kunhyuk Kang (S'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2003.

In this paper, we examine the impact of NBTI degradation in memory elements of digital circuits, focusing on the conventional 6T-SRAM-array topology. An analytical expression for the time-dependent Vt degradation in PMOS transistors based on the empirical reaction-diffusion (RD) framework was employed for our analysis.

A low-frequency analog signal is used to modulate a high-frequency squarewave and the resulting waveform is applied to a high-frequency circuit-under-test (CUT) as a test stimulus. The CUT's response is sampled using a coherent subsampling technique and the captured samples are transmitted at low-speeds off-chip from the SoC. A coupled phase-locked-loop and delay- locked-loop structure is employed to generate test waveforms in the 2.7-GHz range and to support high-resolution sampling with a sampling resolution of less than 10 ps.

In field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), interconnect delay is contributed by programmable routing switches. This increases the wire delay significantly. In FPGA devices, the interconnect delay is usually more than 40% of the total delay. Techniques like wire pipelining and retiming can manage delay of timing critical wires. However, the latency of the design limits the total pipelining in the design. Therefore, new techniques are needed at synthesis stage to consider the effect of critical wires in the design. In this paper, we propose an intuitive Critical Edge Reduction (CER) algorithm, which minimizes the number of critical wires on a maximal delay- budgeting solution under fixed latency constraint. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We provide an integer linear programming formulation of the problem and an iterative heuristic algorithm (CER). During the course of our algorithm, we introduce multiple graph problems. We give a proof of NP-hardness of one such problem, which we call max arc-cost balancing problem. In our experiments, we present an in-depth analysis of tradeoff between various maximal budgetings and critical edge minimization. We implemented our design flow using a set of MediaBench datapaths on Xilinx VirtexE FPGA devices. Using our algorithm, the Xilinx Place-and-Route tool achieved timing closure, which is, on average, 2.8 times faster than using maximum budgeting. The resulting average clock period using CER algorithm outperforms the one using the maximum budgeting by 6%. Other results show similar advantages of critical edge minimization over traditional budgeting techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2007.896319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4305238/04305256.pdf","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2007.896319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect Criticality-Driven Delay Relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305256/","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect Criticality-Driven Delay Relaxation","volume":"26","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633375","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305256/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect Criticality-Driven Delay Relaxation","sourcePdf":"26tcad10-singhal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111623S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4305238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4305238","articleId":"4305256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305262,"authors":[{"name":"Andy Adler","affiliation":["Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305262/4305262-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andy Adler received the B.A.Sc. degree (with honors) in engineering physics from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 1990 and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 1995.","He has worked in postdoctoral positions with McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, PQ, and with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver.

Since recognizing faces is a task that humans are understood to be very good at, it is common to want to compare automatic face recognition (AFR) and human face recognition (HFR) in terms of biometric performance. This paper addresses this question by: 1) conducting verification tests on volunteers (HFR) and commercial AFR systems and 2) developing statistical methods to support comparison of the performance of different biometric systems. HFR was tested by presenting face-image pairs and asking subjects to classify them on a scale of ldquoSame,rdquo ldquoProbably Same,rdquo ldquoNot sure,rdquo ldquoProbably Different,rdquo and ldquoDifferentrdquo; the same image pairs were presented to AFR systems, and the biometric match score was measured. To evaluate these results, two new statistical evaluation techniques are developed. The first is a new way to normalize match-score distributions, where a normalized match score is calculated as a function of the angle from a representation of [false match rate, false nonmatch rate] values in polar coordinates from some center. Using this normalization, we develop a second methodology to calculate an average detection error tradeoff (DET) curve and show that this method is equivalent to direct averaging of DET data along each angle from the center. This procedure is then applied to compare the performance of the best AFR algorithms available to us in the years 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006, in comparison to human scores. Results show that algorithms have dramatically improved in performance over that time. In comparison to the performance of the best AFR system of 2006, 29.2% of human subjects performed better, while 37.5% performed worse.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305262.pdf","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.907036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.907036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Human and Automatic Face Recognition Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Face recognition","Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","System testing","Security","Statistical analysis","Face detection","Computer errors","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","image matching","image representation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection error tradeoff curve","image representation","match-score distribution","statistical evaluation","biometric system","statistical method","biometric performance","human face recognition","automatic face recognition","security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","detection error tradeoff","face recognition","performance analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Observer Variation","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Human and Automatic Face Recognition Performance","volume":"37","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305262/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624780","pubMedId":"17926707","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Human and Automatic Face Recognition Performance","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-adler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070519S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305264,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305264/4305264-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Chen received the B.Sc. degree in industrial automation and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

Based upon the general representation of individual particles, this paper introduces a decreasing coefficient to the updating principle, so that PSO can be viewed as a regular stochastic approximation algorithm. To improve exploration ability, a random velocity is added to the velocity updating in order to balance exploration behavior and convergence rate with respect to different optimization problems. To emphasize the role of this additional velocity, the modified PSO paradigm is named PSO with controllable random exploration velocity (PSO-CREV). Its convergence is proved using Lyapunov theory on stochastic process. From the proof, some properties brought by the stochastic components are obtained such as ldquodivergence before convergencerdquo and ldquocontrollable exploration.rdquo Finally, a series of benchmarks is proposed to verify the feasibility of PSO-CREV.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305264.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.897922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.897922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified PSO Structure Resulting in High Exploration Ability With Convergence Guaranteed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Stochastic processes","Particle swarm optimization","Velocity control","Neural networks","Space technology","Educational institutions","Marine animals","Approximation algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","Lyapunov methods","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic process","Lyapunov theory","controllable random exploration velocity","stochastic approximation algorithm","population-based stochastic recursion","particle swarm optimization","convergence guaranteed","high exploration ability","modified PSO structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov theory","particle swarm optimization with controllable random exploration velocity (PSO-CREV)","stochastic approximation","supermartingale convergence"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Behavior, Animal","Computer Simulation","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Movement","Social Behavior","Stochastic Processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Modified PSO Structure Resulting in High Exploration Ability With Convergence Guaranteed","volume":"37","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305264/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624782","pubMedId":"17926709","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified PSO Structure Resulting in High Exploration Ability With Convergence Guaranteed","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164374S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4305270,"authors":[{"name":"John Daugman","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305270/4305270-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["John Daugman received the A.B. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.","He was with the faculty of Harvard University before he joined Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K., in 1991, where he is currently with the Computer Laboratory.

Using no data set provided in advance, the proposed system grounds language in a physical context, as mediated by its perceptual capacities. It is carried out using show-and-tell procedures, interacting with its human partner. Moreover, this procedure is open-ended for new words and multiword utterances. These facilities are supported by a self-organizing incremental neural network, which can execute online unsupervised classification and topology learning. Embodied with a mental imagery, the system also learns by both top-down and bottom-up processes, which are the syntactic structures that are contained in utterances.

In this correspondence, it is revealed that this condition is sufficient but not necessary for an LVI being strictly monotone (or monotone) on its constrained set where equality constraints are present. Then, it is proposed to reformulate monotone LVIs with equality constraints into LVIs with inequality constraints only, which are then possible to be solved by using some existing neural networks. General projection neural networks are designed in this correspondence for solving the transformed LVIs. Compared with existing neural networks, the designed neural networks feature lower model complexity. Moreover, the neural networks are guaranteed to be globally convergent to solutions of the LVI under the condition that the linear mapping Mx + p is monotone on the constrained set. Because quadratic and linear programming problems are special cases of LVI in terms of solutions, the designed neural networks can solve them efficiently as well. In addition, it is discovered that the designed neural network in a specific case turns out to be the primal-dual network for solving quadratic or linear programming problems. The effectiveness of the neural networks is illustrated by several numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.903706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305278.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.903706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305278/","displayDocTitle":"Design of General Projection Neural Networks for Solving Monotone Linear Variational Inequalities and Linear and Quadratic Optimization Problems","volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624790","pubMedId":"17926722","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305278/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of General Projection Neural Networks for Solving Monotone Linear Variational Inequalities and Linear and Quadratic Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079462S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4305279,"authors":[{"name":"Luping Ji","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Luping","lastName":"Ji","id":"37673078600"},{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37267126100"},{"name":"Lifeng Shang","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Shang","id":"37708362700"},{"name":"Xiaorong Pu","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaorong","lastName":"Pu","id":"37661499500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4305279","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":725},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Iterative algorithms","Neural networks","Skeleton","Neurons","Image recognition","Noise robustness","Humans","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","image thinning","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary fingerprint image thinning","template-based PCNN","binary-image-thinning algorithm","template-based pulse-coupled neural-network model","coupled templates","binary image","pulse neurons","direction-constraining scheme","fingerprint ridge spikes","fingerprint identification system","recognition performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled template","fingerprint thinning","image skeletonization","pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)","recognition performance","thinning rate (TR)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Dermatoglyphics","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence presents a coarse-to-fine binary-image-thinning algorithm by proposing a template-based pulse-coupled neural-network model.

Tensors are higher order extensions of vectors and matrices, which make it possible to analyze different appearance factors of facial variation. Using higher order tensors, we can construct a multilinear structure and model the multiple factors of face variation. In particular, among the appearance factors, the factor of a person's identity modeled by a tensor structure can be used for face recognition. However, this tensor-based face recognition creates difficulty in factorizing the unknown parameters of a new test image and solving for the person-identity parameter. In this paper, to break this limitation of applying the tensor-based methods to face recognition, we propose a novel tensor approach based on an individual-modeling method and nonlinear mappings. The proposed method does not require the problematic tensor factorization and is more efficient than the traditional TensorFaces method with respect to computation and memory. We set up the problem of solving for the unknown factors as a least squares problem with a quadratic equality constraint and solve it using numerical optimization techniques. We show that an individual-multilinear approach reduces the order of the tensor so that it makes face-recognition tasks computationally efficient as well as analytically simpler. We also show that nonlinear kernel mappings can be applied to this optimization problem and provide more accuracy to face-recognition systems than linear mappings. In this paper, we show that the proposed method, individual kernel TensorFaces, produces the better discrimination power for classification. The novelty in our approach as compared to previous work is that the Individual Kernel TensorFaces method does not require estimating any factor of a new test image for face recognition. In addition, we do not need to have any a priori knowledge of or assumption about the factors of a test image when using the proposed method. We can apply individual kernel TensorFaces even if the factors of a test image are absent from the training set. Based on various experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University Pose, Illumination, and Expression database, we demonstrate that the proposed method produces reliable results for face recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Individual Kernel Tensor-Subspaces for Robust Face Recognition: A Computationally Efficient Tensor Framework Without Requiring Mode Factorization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305285.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Individual Kernel Tensor-Subspaces for Robust Face Recognition: A Computationally Efficient Tensor Framework Without Requiring Mode Factorization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305285/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624795","pubMedId":"17926699","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Individual Kernel Tensor-Subspaces for Robust Face Recognition: A Computationally Efficient Tensor Framework Without Requiring Mode Factorization","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071685S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305287,"authors":[{"name":"Sibel Senan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sibel","lastName":"Senan","id":"37422032100"},{"name":"Sabri Arik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sabri","lastName":"Arik","id":"37266628200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4305287","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Associative memory","Neural networks","Delay effects","Magnesium compounds","Asymptotic stability","Sufficient conditions","Neurons","Signal processing","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","discrete time systems","neural nets","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous nonmonotonic neuron activation functions","delay parameter","network parameters","discrete time delays","global robust asymptotic stability","multiple time delays","bidirectional associative memory neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delayed neural networks","equilibrium and stability analysis","Lyapunov functionals"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305287","abstract":"This correspondence presents a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness, and global robust asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for bidirectional associative memory neural networks with discrete time delays.

We describe a face mosaicing scheme that generates a composite face image during enrollment based on the evidence provided by frontal and semiproflle face images of an individual. Face mosaicing obviates the need to store multiple face templates representing multiple poses of a user's face image. In the proposed scheme, the side profile images are aligned with the frontal image using a hierarchical registration algorithm that exploits neighborhood properties to determine the transformation relating the two images. Multiresolution splining is then used to blend the side profiles with the frontal image, thereby generating a composite face image of the user. A texture-based face recognition technique that is a slightly modified version of the C2 algorithm proposed by Serre et al. is used to compare a probe face image with the gallery face mosaic. Experiments conducted on three different databases indicate that face mosaicing, as described in this paper, offers significant benefits by accounting for the pose variations that are commonly observed in face images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mosaicing Scheme for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.903537","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305288.pdf","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.903537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Mosaicing Scheme for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305288/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624798","pubMedId":"17926704","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mosaicing Scheme for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-singh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150717S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305289,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris G.

The PRFNNs are modular structures comprising a number of modules that are interconnected in a chained form. Each module is implemented by a small-scale recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) with internal dynamics. Due to module nesting, the PRFNNs offer a number of desirable attributes, including decomposition of the modeling task, enhanced temporal processing capabilities, and multistage dynamic fuzzy inference. Tuning of the PRFNN adaptable parameters is accomplished by a series of gradient descent methods with different weighting of the modules and the decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) algorithm, based on weight grouping. Extensive experimentation is carried out to evaluate the performance of the PRFNNs on the speech prediction platform. Comparative analysis shows that the PRFNNs outperform the single-RFNN models in terms of the prediction gains that are obtained and computational efficiency. Furthermore, PRFNNs provide considerably better performance compared to pipelined recurrent neural networks, for models with similar model complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Adaptive systems","Speech","Recurrent neural networks","Pipeline processing","Neurons","Predictive models","Neural networks","IIR filters","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","gradient methods","Kalman filters","pipeline processing","recurrent neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined recurrent fuzzy neural network","nonlinear adaptive speech prediction","modular structure","module nesting","modeling task decomposition","temporal processing capability","multistage dynamic fuzzy inference","gradient descent method","decoupled extended Kalman filter algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic fuzzy inference","extended Kalman filtering","modular network","ordered derivatives","pipelined predictor","recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Fuzzy Logic","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Speech Recognition Software"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.900516","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305289.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.900516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Networks for Nonlinear Adaptive Speech Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Networks for Nonlinear Adaptive Speech Prediction","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9624799","pubMedId":"17926711","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","volume":"37","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305289/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Networks for Nonlinear Adaptive Speech Prediction","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-stavrakoudis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085556S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305290,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan-Li Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","Institute of Textiles and Clothing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305290/4305290-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhan-Li Sun received the B.Sc. degree from Huainan Industrial University, Huainan, China, in 1997, the M.Sc. degree from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2005.","From March 2006 to March 2007, he was a Research Associate in the Institute of Textiles and Clothing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The proposed method is an improved version of the regular neuro-fuzzy TSK fuzzy inference system. For the proposed method, first, the data that are processed are grouped by the k-means clustering method. The membership of arbitrary input for each fuzzy rule is then derived through an ELM, followed by a normalization method. At the same time, the consequent part of the fuzzy rules is obtained by multiple ELMs. At last, the approximate prediction value is determined by a weight computation scheme. For the ELM-based TSK fuzzy inference system, two extensions are also proposed to improve its accuracy. The proposed methods can avoid the curse of dimensionality that is encountered in backpropagation and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. Moreover, the proposed methods have a competitive performance in training time and accuracy compared to three ANFIS methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.901375","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.901375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305290.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Through Integration of Fuzzy Logic and Extreme Learning Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Through Integration of Fuzzy Logic and Extreme Learning Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624800","pubMedId":"17926712","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305290/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Through Integration of Fuzzy Logic and Extreme Learning Machines","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103445S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305291,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbing Tao","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenbing","lastName":"Tao","id":"37591969900"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276607900"},{"name":"Yimin Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069489600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4305291","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":247,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":5610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Image segmentation","Pixel","Robustness","Computational complexity","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Optimization methods","Noise reduction","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image colour analysis","image segmentation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph partitioning","image clustering","real-time image segmentation","normalized cut partitioning","color images","robust segmentation","normalized cuts","mean shift segmentation","color image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color image segmentation","graph partitioning","mean shift (MS)","normalized cut (Ncut)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Color","Colorimetry","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305291","abstract":"In this correspondence, we develop a novel approach that provides effective and robust segmentation of color images. By incorporating the advantages of the mean shift (MS) segmentation and the normalized cut (Ncut) partitioning methods, the proposed method requires low computational complexity and is therefore very feasible for real-time image segmentation processing. It preprocesses an image by using the MS algorithm to form segmented regions that preserve the desirable discontinuity characteristics of the image. The segmented regions are then represented by using the graph structures, and the Ncut method is applied to perform globally optimized clustering. Because the number of the segmented regions is much smaller than that of the image pixels, the proposed method allows a low-dimensional image clustering with significant reduction of the complexity compared to conventional graph-partitioning methods that are directly applied to the image pixels. In addition, the image clustering using the segmented regions, instead of the image pixels, also reduces the sensitivity to noise and results in enhanced image segmentation performance. Furthermore, to avoid some inappropriate partitioning when considering every region as only one graph node, we develop an improved segmentation strategy using multiple child nodes for each region. The superiority of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated through a large number of experiments using color natural scene images.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.902249","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305291.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.902249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Image Segmentation Based on Mean Shift and Normalized Cuts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Color Image Segmentation Based on Mean Shift and Normalized Cuts","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9624801","pubMedId":"17926718","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305291/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Image Segmentation Based on Mean Shift and Normalized Cuts","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-tao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078953S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":4305292,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Beng Jin Teoh","affiliation":["Biometrics Engineering Research Center (BERC), Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305292/4305292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Beng Jin Teoh (M'06) received the B.Eng.

This paper presents a two-factor cancelable formulation, where the biometric data are distorted in a revocable but nonreversible manner by first transforming the raw biometric data into a fixed-length feature vector and then projecting the feature vector onto a sequence of random subspaces that were derived from a user-specific pseudorandom number (PRN).

Initially, Galerkin's method is applied to the PDE system to derive a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system that accurately describes the dynamics of the dominant (slow) modes of the PDE system. Subsequently, a systematic modeling procedure is given to construct exactly a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model for the finite-dimensional ODE system under state constraints. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a sufficient condition for the existence of a stabilizing fuzzy controller is derived, which guarantees that the state constraints are satisfied and provides an upper bound on the quadratic performance function for the finite-dimensional slow system. The resulting fuzzy controllers can also guarantee the exponential stability of the closed-loop PDE system. Moreover, a local optimization algorithm based on the linear matrix inequalities is proposed to compute the feedback gain matrices of a suboptimal fuzzy controller in the sense of minimizing the quadratic performance bound. Finally, the proposed design method is applied to the control of the temperature profile of a catalytic rod.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Dimensional Constrained Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear Distributed Process Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Dimensional Constrained Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear Distributed Process Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624806","pubMedId":"17926723","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Dimensional Constrained Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear Distributed Process Systems","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-wu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063866S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4305299,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Zhou","affiliation":["Center for Research in Intelligent Systems, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4305261/4305299/4305299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoli Zhou received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

Information from two biometrics sources, side face and gait, is utilized and integrated for recognition. For side face, an enhanced side-face image (ESFI), a higher resolution image compared with the image directly obtained from a single video frame, is constructed, which integrates face information from multiple video frames. For gait, the gait energy image (GEI), a spatio-temporal compact representation of gait in video, is used to characterize human-walking properties. The features of face and gait are obtained separately using the principal component analysis and multiple discriminant analysis combined method from ESFI and GEI, respectively. They are then integrated at the match score level by using different fusion strategies. The approach is tested on a database of video sequences, corresponding to 45 people, which are collected over seven months. The different fusion methods are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that: 1) the idea of constructing ESFI from multiple frames is promising for human recognition in video, and better face features are extracted from ESFI compared to those from the original side-face images (OSFIs); 2) the synchronization of face and gait is not necessary for face template ESFI and gait template GEI; the synthetic match scores combine information from them; and 3) an integrated information from side face and gait is effective for human recognition in video.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Face and Gait for Human Recognition at a Distance in Video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2006.889612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4305261/04305299.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2006.889612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Face and Gait for Human Recognition at a Distance in Video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305299/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624809","pubMedId":"17926696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Face and Gait for Human Recognition at a Distance in Video","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb05-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085714S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4305261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4305261","articleId":"4305299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305310,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Hee Choi","affiliation":["Power Conversion Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4305307/4305310/4305310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chan-Hee Choi (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, Korea, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Power Conversion Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering.","His current research interests include high-performance electrical machine drives and sensorless drives of ac machine."]},"firstName":"Chan-Hee","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292668400"},{"name":"Jul-Ki Seok","affiliation":["Power Conversion Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4305307/4305310/4305310-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jul-Ki Seok (S'94-M'98) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1992, 1994, and 1998, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1998 to 2001, he was a Senior Engineer with the Production Engineering Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea.

From the sensitivity analysis of the effect on magnetic saturation, we confirm that the compensation error due to saturation has little negative impact on the proposed compensation method.

Practical modifications to the drive system controls are implemented to reduce the circulating currents between paralleled systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2007.904415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2007.904415","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4305307/04305316.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating Circulating Common-Mode Currents Between Parallel Soft-Switched Drive Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating Circulating Common-Mode Currents Between Parallel Soft-Switched Drive Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305316/","accessionNumber":"9633316","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305316/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating Circulating Common-Mode Currents Between Parallel Soft-Switched Drive Systems","sourcePdf":"43tia05-cuzner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056257S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4305307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4305307","articleId":"4305316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4305318,"authors":[{"name":"Jason D.

The impedance of the LCL filter has a typical frequency characteristic with a resonance peak. Hence, the LCL filter has to be damped in order to avoid instability. However, the resonance of the LCL filter can be also excited in a controlled way in order to individuate the resonance frequency in the spectrum (using for example the fast Fourier transform). This paper proposes to use a controlled excitation in measuring the grid impedance, since this one influences also the resonance frequency. This paper will address some possible limits, some solutions, and some implementation issues (e.g., how to obtain a controlled resonance in the filter without damaging the system) in order to use the resonant peak for grid impedance detection. The analysis is validated both by simulations and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2007.904439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4305307/04305326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2007.904439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305307","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid Impedance Estimation via Excitation of --Filter Resonance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grid Impedance Estimation via Excitation of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex> </formula>-Filter Resonance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633326","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid Impedance Estimation via Excitation of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex> </formula>-Filter Resonance","sourcePdf":"43tia05-liserre.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069315S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4305307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"4305307","articleId":"4305326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305335,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Augusto Serpa","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zentrum/ETL H16, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4305307/4305335/4305335-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Augusto Serpa (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

The LCL filter can cause a strong resonance and requires additional effort for system control. The application of a DPC for the control of a three-phase voltage source inverter that is connected to the grid through an filter has not yet been considered. The addition of an active damping strategy, together with a harmonic rejection control loop, to the conventional DPC is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The steady-state, as well as the dynamic performance of the proposed system, is verified with simulation results and experimental measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4305307/04305335.pdf","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2007.904438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2007.904438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Direct Power Control Strategy Allowing the Connection of Three-Phase Inverters to the Grid Through - Filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Inverters","Pulse width modulation","Switching frequency","Voltage control","Damping","Power harmonic filters","Resonance","Control systems","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","invertors","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct power control strategy","three phase inverters","LCL filters","three phase voltage source inverter","active damping strategy","harmonic rejection control loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping","direct power control (DPC)","grid-connected inverter","$LCL$ filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Direct Power Control Strategy Allowing the Connection of Three-Phase Inverters to the Grid Through <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex></formula> Filters","volume":"43","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305335/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633334","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Direct Power Control Strategy Allowing the Connection of Three-Phase Inverters to the Grid Through <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex></formula> Filters","sourcePdf":"43tia05-serpa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063001S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4305307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4305307","articleId":"4305335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305344,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Aiazzi","affiliation":["Nello Carrara CNR Area di Ricerca di Firenze IFAC-CNR, Institute of Applied Physics, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4305343/4305344/4305344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno Aiazzi was born in Florence, Italy, in 1961.

A general scheme that is capable of modeling any CS image fusion method is presented and discussed. According to this scheme, a generalized intensity component is defined as the weighted average of the multispectral (MS) bands. The weights are obtained as regression coefficients between the MS bands and the spatially degraded panchromatic (Pan) image, with the aim of capturing the spectral responses of the sensors. Once it has been integrated into the Gram-Schmidt spectral-sharpening method, which is implemented in environment for visualizing images (ENVI) program, and into the generalized intensity-hue-saturation fusion method, the proposed preprocessing module allows the production of fused images of the same spatial sharpness but of increased spectral quality with respect to the standard implementations. In addition, quantitative scores carried out on spatially degraded data clearly confirm the superiority of the enhanced methods over their baselines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Component Substitution Pansharpening Through Multivariate Regression of MS -Pan Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.901007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4305343/04305344.pdf","startPage":"3230","endPage":"3239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.901007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving Component Substitution Pansharpening Through Multivariate Regression of MS <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$+$</tex></formula>Pan Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305344/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606596","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Component Substitution Pansharpening Through Multivariate Regression of MS <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$+$</tex></formula>Pan Data","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-aiazzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066867S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"512","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4305345,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Alparone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Alparone","id":"37272265700"},{"name":"Lucien Wald","affiliation":["Centre dEnergetique, Groupe Teledetection and Modelisation, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Lucien","lastName":"Wald","id":"37376315000"},{"name":"Jocelyn Chanussot","affiliation":["GIPSA-Lab, Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG), Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Chanussot","id":"37265876800"},{"name":"Claire Thomas","affiliation":["Centre dEnergetique, Groupe Teledetection and Modelisation, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37720276200"},{"name":"Paolo Gamba","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e1 di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Gamba","id":"37272212500"},{"name":"Lori Mann Bruce","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Lori Mann","lastName":"Bruce","id":"37269412200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"4305345","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":494,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":2137},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305345","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Geoscience and remote sensing","Image sensors","Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","Testing","Multiresolution analysis","Satellites","Degradation","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","remote sensing","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pansharpening algorithms","GRS-S data-fusion contest","Data Fusion Committee","IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","component substitution","multiresolution analysis","detail injection","QuickBird sensor","simulated Pleiades sensor","higher resolution data","airborne platform","coarser resolution","International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","Denver","adaptive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","multispectral (MS) imagery","pansharpening","quality assessment","QuickBird (QB)","simulated Pl\u00c9iades data"]}],"abstract":"In January 2006, the Data Fusion Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society launched a public contest for pansharpening algorithms, which aimed to identify the ones that perform best. Seven research groups worldwide participated in the contest, testing eight algorithms following different philosophies [component substitution, multiresolution analysis (MRA), detail injection, etc.]. Several complete data sets from two different sensors, namely, QuickBird and simulated Pleiades, were delivered to all participants. The fusion results were collected and evaluated, both visually and objectively. Quantitative results of pansharpening were possible owing to the availability of reference originals obtained either by simulating the data collected from the satellite sensor by means of higher resolution data from an airborne platform, in the case of the Pleiades data, or by first degrading all the available data to a coarser resolution and saving the original as the reference, in the case of the QuickBird data. The evaluation results were presented during the special session on data fusion at the 2006 international geoscience and remote sensing symposium in Denver, and these are discussed in further detail in this paper. Two algorithms outperform all the others, the visual analysis being confirmed by the quantitative evaluation. These two methods share the same philosophy: they basically rely on MRA and employ adaptive models for the injection of high-pass details.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.904923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.904923","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4305343/04305345.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Pansharpening Algorithms: Outcome of the 2006 GRS-S Data-Fusion Contest","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Pansharpening Algorithms: Outcome of the 2006 GRS-S Data-Fusion Contest","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9606597","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305345/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Pansharpening Algorithms: Outcome of the 2006 GRS-S Data-Fusion Contest","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-alparone.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071883S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"494","articleId":"4305345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305350,"authors":[{"name":"Shangshu Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the GeoResources Institute in the High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPC 2), Mississippi State University, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4305343/4305350/4305350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shangshu Cai (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering (Special Class for the Gifted Young) from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

The method is designed to handle the special characteristics of hyperspectral images, namely, high-input dimension of pixels, low number of labeled samples, and spatial variability of the spectral signature. To alleviate these problems, the method incorporates three ingredients, respectively. First, being a kernel-based method, it combats the curse of dimensionality efficiently. Second, following a semi-supervised approach, it exploits the wealth of unlabeled samples in the image, and naturally gives relative importance to the labeled ones through a graph-based methodology. Finally, it incorporates contextual information through a full family of composite kernels. Noting that the graph method relies on inverting a huge kernel matrix formed by both labeled and unlabeled samples, we originally introduce the Nystro umlm method in the formulation to speed up the classification process. The presented semi-supervised-graph-based method is compared to state-of-the-art support vector machines in the classification of hyperspectral data. The proposed method produces better classification maps, which capture the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by labeled and unlabeled points. Good and stable accuracy is produced in ill-posed classification problems (high dimensional spaces and low number of labeled samples). In addition, the introduction of the composite-kernel framework drastically improves results, and the new fast formulation ranks almost linearly in the computational cost, rather than cubic as in the original method, thus allowing the use of this method in remote-sensing applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Supervised Graph-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.895416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4305343/04305352.pdf","startPage":"3044","endPage":"3054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.895416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Supervised Graph-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305352/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9616124","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Supervised Graph-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-campsvalls.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164971S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"440","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4305354,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick W.

Variables with circular structure (e.g., time of day, day of year, and Earth location) appear in many different contexts within geoscience and remote sensing. Some common representations of circular variables (e.g., time of day in hours) can introduce discontinuities or topological distortions in estimation problems. They do not necessarily prevent a neural network from learning a relationship with circular dependencies. However, using topologically appropriate representations of circular variables can reduce the complexity necessary for a neural network to accurately learn such a relationship despite possibly increasing the number of inputs thereby reducing training times. In this paper, neural networks are trained to learn fictitious geophysical functions of time of day, of geolocation, and of time of year. In all three examples, using topologically appropriate representations of time and geolocation instead of conventional representations as inputs significantly reduced rms errors. Neural networks are also trained to learn the variations of air temperature observations with time of day and day of year, and one-month averages of sea surface temperature with geolocation. The improvement achieved by using topologically appropriate representations was limited by a natural random behavior in the data. However, there is a small but significant improvement in estimating the sea surface temperatures. Using the topologically appropriate representations of circular data when training the neural networks could be important in global Earth science remote sensing contexts, where significant diurnal, seasonal, or geographical variations exist. The studies presented also suggest the development of a more general framework for training neural networks that considers the topology of variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9616125","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305354/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Characterization of Geophysical Processes With Circular Dependencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Characterization of Geophysical Processes With Circular Dependencies","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036842S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305361,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro C.

We explore methods to display such image sets by linearly projecting them onto basis functions designed for the red, green, and blue (RGB) primaries of a standard tristimulus display, for the human visual system, and for the signal-to-noise ratio of the dataset, creating a single color image. Projecting the data onto three basis functions reduces the information but allows each datapoint to be rendered by a single color. Principal components analysis is perhaps the most commonly used linear projection method, but it is data adaptive and, thus, yields inconsistent visualizations that may be difficult to interpret. Instead, we focus on designing fixed basis functions based on optimizing criteria in the perceptual colorspace CIELab and the standardized device colorspace sRGB. This approach yields visualizations with rich meaning that users can readily extract. Example visualizations are shown for passive radar video and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer hyperspectral imagery.

However, most existing fusion processes produce color distortion in 1-m fused IKONOS images due to nonsymmetrical spectral responses of IKONOS imagery. Here, we proposed a fusion process to minimize this spectral distortion in IKONOS 1-m color images. The 1-m fused image is produced from a 4-m multispectral (MS) and 1-m panchromatic (PAN) image, maintaining the relations of spectral responses between PAN and each band of the MS images. To obtain this relation, four spectral weighting parameters are added with the pixel value of each band of the original MS image. Then, each pixel value is updated using a steepest descent method to reflect the maximum spectral response on the fused image. Comparison among the proposed technique and existing processes [intensity hue saturation (IHS) image fusion, Brovey transform, principal component analysis, fast IHS image fusion] has been done. Our proposed technique has succeeded to generate 1-m fused images where spectral distortion has been reduced significantly, although some block distortions appeared at the edge of the fused images. To remove this block distortion, we also proposed a sharpening process using a wavelet transform, which removed block distortion without significant change in the color of the entire image.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4305343/04305370.pdf","startPage":"3075","endPage":"3086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.897692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.897692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Fusion Processing for IKONOS 1-m Color Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Color","Discrete wavelet transforms","Pixel","Principal component analysis","Wavelet transforms","Spatial resolution","Remote monitoring","Associate members","Fusion power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image colour analysis","image fusion","principal component analysis","terrain mapping","vegetation mapping","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion processing","IKONOS -1m color imagery","color distortion","nonsymmetrical spectral responses","4-m multispectral image","1-m panchromatic image","MS image","PAN image","spectral weighting parameters","steepest descent method","intensity hue saturation","IHS image fusion","Brovey transform","principal component analysis","spectral distortion","wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Histogram matching","IKONOS","image fusion process","spectral distortion","spectral response","steepest descent method","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Fusion Processing for IKONOS 1-m Color Imagery","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608443","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Fusion Processing for IKONOS 1-m Color Imagery","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-kalpoma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10365S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4305374,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Rocca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4305343/4305374/4305374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Rocca received the Dottore degree in ingegneria elettronica from Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 1962.","He is currently a Professor of digital signal processing with the Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.

Permanent scatterers (PSs) are helpful to overcome these problems, but their density in agricultural and out-of-town areas is not always sufficient. The forthcoming availability of satellite platforms with thinner orbital tubes and shorter revisit times will enhance the use of interferogram stacks, which are usable for distributed and progressively decorrelating targets, like those found in agricultural areas. To estimate the possibilities of the interferogram stack technique, a Markovian model for the temporal decorrelation is considered. ERS-1 data measured in C-band over Rome with a three-day repeat cycle are used to identify the parameters for this model, namely, the decorrelation time (estimated as 40 days) and the short-term coherence (estimated as 0.6). In the hypothesis of small deviations from a model of the motion, the optimal weights to be used to combine a sequence of interferograms taken at intervals that are shorter than the decorrelation time are calculated in the cases of progressive and sinusoidal ground motion. The dispersion of the optimal estimate of the motion is then determined. This model is extended to frequencies other than C-band. These evaluations are compared with the known results obtained for PSs. As an example, the case of a time interval between the takes of T = 12 days is considered. With N consecutive images, interferogram stack results are equivalent to PSs if the pixel count in the window used to smooth the interferograms grows with N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305374/","accessionNumber":"9616127","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Interferogram Stacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Interferogram Stacks","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-rocca.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110961S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4305381,"authors":[{"name":"Ryo Yamaki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4305343/4305381/4305381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ryo Yamaki was born in Tokushima, Japan, on September 21, 1983.

Although the minimum-cost network-flow method is an effective and widely used technique, some problems still remain. That is, the method often generates spikes in high SP-density areas and long clifflike artifacts for isolated SPs. It also takes a long time to unwrap phase data that contain many SPs. In this paper, we propose a new unwrapping method, namely, singularity-spreading phase unwrapping (SSPU), which solves these problems. In this method, we spread the singularity at SPs around to make the closely located positive and negative SPs combine gently with each other or make the isolated SPs fade away. Experiments demonstrate that the spreading process compensates the distortion in phase values in the vicinities of SPs appropriately for landscape reconstruction. The SSPU generates high-quality DEMs with smaller calculation costs than the conventional method. Besides the simple SSPU, we also present weighted SSPU where we utilize amplitude information to improve the performance further. In addition, we discuss the relationship between landscape characteristics and SSPU performance.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.906973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4305343/04305381.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.906973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"3240","endPage":"3251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Singularity-Spreading Phase Unwrapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Singularity-Spreading Phase Unwrapping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305381/","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305381/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606601","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Singularity-Spreading Phase Unwrapping","sourcePdf":"45tgrs10-yamaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055409S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4305343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4305343","articleId":"4305381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4305384,"authors":[{"name":"George Atia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Atia","id":"37284105700"},{"name":"Masoud Sharif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Sharif","id":"38290751600"},{"name":"Venkatesh Saligrama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Saligrama","id":"37301183700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305384","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Statistical distributions","Decoding","Digital relays","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Diversity methods","Engineering profession","Rayleigh channels","Distribution functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel capacity","Rayleigh channels","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal outage","relay channel","fading distribution","multiantenna point-to-point link","channel statistics","Rayleigh distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperation","diversity","fading channels","outage capacity","relay channel"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence deals with the outage capacity of relay networks in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. This work is motivated by the fact that in relay channels, unlike multi-antenna point-to-point links, the transmitters, i.e., source and relays, may not be co-located and therefore their channel statistics can be quite different. It has been recently shown that bursty amplify and forward (BAF) is outage optimal when all the links have a Rayleigh distribution. In this correspondence, it is shown that BAF is in fact outage optimal for a wide class of independent channels with smooth distribution functions. Optimality of BAF is further generalized to a special class of dependent channels, namely, the case where we opportunistically use only the best relay (out of N relays). It turns out that relative to the strategy where all the N relays are used, this opportunistic best relay strategy uses significantly smaller average power (independent of ) while suffering negligible increase in outage. This holds out potential for significant gains in an ad hoc network scenario where minimizing interference to possibly other users as well as conserving power are important considerations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","startPage":"3786","endPage":"3797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Optimal Outage in Relay Channels With General Fading Distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Optimal Outage in Relay Channels With General Fading Distributions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617861","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305384/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Optimal Outage in Relay Channels With General Fading Distributions","sourcePdf":"53tit10-atia-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091475S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4305386,"authors":[{"name":"Waheed U.

In this paper, a distributed joint source-channel communication architecture is proposed for energy-efficient estimation of sensor field data at a distant destination and the corresponding relationships between power, distortion, and latency are analyzed as a function of number of sensor nodes. The approach is applicable to a broad class of sensed signal fields and is based on distributed computation of appropriately chosen projections of sensor data at the destination - phase-coherent transmissions from the sensor nodes enable exploitation of the distributed beamforming gain for energy efficiency. Random projections are used when little or no prior knowledge is available about the signal field. Distinct features of the proposed scheme include: (1) processing and communication are combined into one distributed projection operation; (2) it virtually eliminates the need for in-network processing and communication; (3) given sufficient prior knowledge about the sensed data, consistent estimation is possible with increasing sensor density even with vanishing total network power; and (4) consistent signal estimation is possible with power and latency requirements growing at most sublinearly with the number of sensor nodes even when little or no prior knowledge about the sensed data is assumed at the sensor nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source\u2013Channel Communication for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305386.pdf","startPage":"3629","endPage":"3653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source\u2013Channel Communication for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305386/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606593","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source\u2013Channel Communication for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"53tit10-bajwa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109249S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305387,"authors":[{"name":"Shashibhushan Borade","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shashibhushan","lastName":"Borade","id":"37326310900"},{"name":"Lizhong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lizhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276915600"},{"name":"Robert Gallager","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Gallager","id":"37283557500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305387","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1077},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Wireless networks","Fading","Digital relays","Symmetric matrices","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Performance gain","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","Gaussian processes","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multiplexing","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless relay networks","multiple hops","single-antenna relays","signal-to-noise ratio","amplify-and-forward strategy","point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO system","random Gaussian matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperation","diversity","multiple antennas","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","random matrices","relay network"]}],"abstract":"A wireless network with fading and a single source-destination pair is considered. The information reaches the destination via multiple hops through a sequence of layers of single-antenna relays. At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the simple amplify-and-forward strategy is shown to be optimal in terms of degrees of freedom, because it achieves the degrees of freedom equal to a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Hence, the lack of coordination in relay nodes does not reduce the achievable degrees of freedom. The performance of this amplify-and-forward strategy degrades with increasing network size. This phenomenon is analyzed by finding the tradeoffs between network size, rate, and diversity. A lower bound on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for concatenation of multiple random Gaussian matrices is obtained. Also, it is shown that achievable network size in the outage formulation (short codes) is a lot smaller than the ergodic formulation (long codes).","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305387.pdf","startPage":"3302","endPage":"3318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward in Wireless Relay Networks: Rate, Diversity, and Network Size","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305387/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward in Wireless Relay Networks: Rate, Diversity, and Network Size","volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610192","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305387/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward in Wireless Relay Networks: Rate, Diversity, and Network Size","sourcePdf":"53tit10-borade.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164982S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305392,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Oussama Damen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed Oussama","lastName":"Damen","id":"37266498600"},{"name":"A.

Recent work by Xia and Hammons have investigated the design of distributed space-time codes that are delay tolerant, in the sense that full spatial diversity is achieved regardless of timing offsets. In general, the previously known space-time block codes belonging to the class of C-linear codes, however, which are important because they achieve full spatial diversity and admit near-optimal lattice decoding algorithms, are not delay tolerant. In this paper, we present a new family of such codes that are fully delay tolerant. The new codes generalize the threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) codes introduced by El Gamal and Damen. Like their brethren, the new distributed-TAST codes are effective and flexible, enabling use of different signaling constellations, transmission rates, numbers of transmit and receive antennas, and decoders of varying levels of complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904773","startPage":"3755","endPage":"3773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305392.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Tolerant Distributed-TAST Codes for Cooperative Diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305392/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Delay-Tolerant Distributed-TAST Codes for Cooperative Diversity","volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305392/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9618913","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Tolerant Distributed-TAST Codes for Cooperative Diversity","sourcePdf":"53tit10-damen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098003S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4305394,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas El Gamal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department and the Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37274961200"},{"name":"Navid Hassanpour","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Hassanpour","id":"37563685600"},{"name":"James Mammen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Mammen","id":"37283902000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305394","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1521},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital relays","Delay effects","AWGN","Decoding","Upper bound","Transmitters","Degradation","Additive white noise","Communication networks","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","decoding","delays","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode-and-forward","amplify-and-forward","channel capacity","additive white Gaussian noise","relay-with-unlimited look-ahead","relay encoding delay","relay channel","link delays","feedforward relay networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","cut-set bound","delay","relay channel","relay networks"]}],"abstract":"The paper investigates the effect of link delays on the capacity of relay networks. The relay-with-delay is defined as a relay channel with relay encoding delay d isin Z of units, or equivalently, a delay of units on the link from the sender to the relay, zero delay on the links from the transmitter to the receiver and from the relay to the receiver, and zero relay encoding delay. Two special cases are studied. The first is the relay-with-unlimited look-ahead, where each relay transmission can depend on its entire received sequence, and the second is the relay-without-delay, where the relay transmission can depend only on current and past received symbols, i.e., d=0. Upper and lower bounds on capacity for these two channels that are tight in some cases are presented. It is shown that the cut-set bound for the classical relay channel, corresponding to the case where d=1, does not hold for the relay-without-delay. Further, it is shown that instantaneous relaying can be optimal and can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. Capacity for the classes of degraded and semi-deterministic relay-with-unlimited-look-ahead and relay-without-delay are established. These results are then extended to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) relay-with-delay case, where it is shown that for any dles0, capacity is achieved using amplify-and-forward when the channel from the sender to the relay is sufficiently weaker than the other two channels. In addition, it is shown that a superposition of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. The relay-with-delay model is then extended to feedforward relay networks. It is shown that capacity is determined only by the relative delays of paths from the sender to the receiver and not by their absolute delays. A new cut-set upper bound that generalizes both the classical cut-set bound for the classical relay and the upper bound for the relay-without-delay on capacity is established.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","startPage":"3413","endPage":"3431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Networks With Delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relay Networks With Delays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305394/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9620560","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305394/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Networks With Delays","sourcePdf":"53tit10-elgamal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09756S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305396,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Gurewitz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Gurewitz","id":"37295856800"},{"name":"Alexandre de Baynast","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"de Baynast","id":"37281720200"},{"name":"Edward W.

A system in which transmissions are assigned to nodes in a collision free, spatial time division fashion is considered. The suggested protocol exploits the broadcast nature of wireless networks where the communication channel is shared between multiple adjacent nodes within interference range. For any upstream end-to-end flow in the tree, each intermediate node receives information from both one-hop and two-hop neighbors and transmits only sufficient information such that the next upstream one-hop neighbor will be able to decode the packet. This approach can be viewed as the generalization of the classical three node relay channel for end-to-end flows in which each intermediate node becomes successively source, relay and destination. The achievable rate for any regular tree network is derived and an optimal schedule that realizes this rate in most cases is proposed. Our protocol is shown to dramatically outperform the conventional scheme where intermediate nodes simply forward the packets hop by hop. At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it yields approximately 66% throughput gain for practical scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305396.pdf","startPage":"3596","endPage":"3614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.905000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.905000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Strategies and Achievable Rate for Tree Networks With Optimal Spatial Reuse","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless application protocol","Throughput","Relays","Spread spectrum communication","Broadcasting","Wireless networks","Communication channels","Interference","Decoding","Optimal scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","decoding","protocols","radio networks","trees (mathematics)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal spatial reuse","low complexity cooperative protocol","multihop upstream transmission","wireless tree network","communication channel","three node relay channel","time division multiple access","decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fairness","relay channel","time division multiaccess","user cooperation","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Strategies and Achievable Rate for Tree Networks With Optimal Spatial Reuse","volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305396/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608000","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Strategies and Achievable Rate for Tree Networks With Optimal Spatial Reuse","sourcePdf":"53tit10-gurewitz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122067S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305397,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Ali Jafar","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Syed Ali","lastName":"Jafar","id":"37269015800"},{"name":"Krishna Srikanth Gomadam","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Krishna Srikanth","lastName":"Gomadam","id":"37637088400"},{"name":"Chiachi Huang","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiachi","lastName":"Huang","id":"38184592900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305397","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Digital relays","Spread spectrum communication","MIMO","Mobile communication","Signal processing","Decoding","Equations","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","broadcast channels","MIMO communication","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duality","rate optimization","broadcast channels","amplify-and-forward relays","multihop multiple access channels","optimal relay amplification","distributed multiple antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","broadcast","capacity","duality","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider multihop multiple access (MAC) and broadcast channels (BC) where communication takes place with the assistance of relays that amplify and forward (AF) their received signals.

Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the discrete memoryless partially cooperative RBC are obtained. When the relay function is disabled, the inner bound reduces to an inner bound on the capacity region of broadcast channels that includes an inner bound of Marton, and GePfand and Pinsker. The outer bound reduces to a new outer bound on the capacity region of broadcast channels that generalizes an outer bound of Marton to include a common message, and that generalizes an outer bound of GePfand and Pinsker to apply to general discrete memoryless broadcast channels. The proof for the outer bound simplifies the proof of GePfand and Pinsker that was based on a recursive approach. Four classes of RBCs are studied in detail. For the partially cooperative RBC with degraded message sets, inner and outer bounds are obtained. For the semideterministic partially cooperative RBC and the orthogonal partially cooperative RBC, the capacity regions are established. For the parallel partially cooperative RBC with unmatched degraded subchannels, the capacity region is established for the case of degraded message sets. The capacity is also established when the source node has only a private message for destination 2, i.e., the channel reduces to a parallel relay channel with unmatched degraded subchannels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305398.pdf","startPage":"3517","endPage":"3535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Regions for Relay Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Degradation","Digital relays","Throughput","Decoding","Gaussian channels","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","channel coding","decoding","memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate regions","partially cooperative RBC","three-node network","source node","destination nodes","relay broadcast channel","discrete memoryless broadcast channels","capacity region","superposition encoding","decode-and-forward scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity region","inner bound","outer bound","parallel relay channels","semideterministic channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Rate Regions for Relay Broadcast Channels","volume":"53","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608001","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Regions for Relay Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"53tit10-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066418S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"114","articleId":"4305398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305399,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171000"},{"name":"Venugopal V.

As a basic information-theoretic model for fading relay channels, the parallel relay channel is first studied, which consists of multiple independent three-terminal relay channels as subchannels. Lower and upper bounds on the capacity are derived, and are shown to match, and thus establish the capacity for the parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels. This capacity theorem is further demonstrated via the Gaussian parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels, for which the synchronized and asynchronized capacities are obtained. The capacity-achieving power allocation at the source and relay nodes among the subchannels is partially characterized for the synchronized case and fully characterized for the asynchronized case. The fading relay channel is then studied, which is based on the three-terminal relay channel with each communication link being corrupted by a multiplicative fading gain coefficient as well as an additive Gaussian noise term. For each link, the fading state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The source and relay nodes are allowed to allocate their power adaptively according to the instantaneous channel state information. The source and relay nodes are assumed to be subject to separate power constraints. For both the full-duplex and half-duplex cases, power allocations that maximize the achievable rates are obtained. In the half-duplex case, the power allocation needs to be jointly optimized with the channel resource (time and bandwidth) allocation between the two orthogonal channels over which the relay node transmits and receives. Capacities are established for fading relay channels that satisfy certain conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305399.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"3432","endPage":"3453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Wireless Fading Relay Channels: Max-Min Solution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Wireless Fading Relay Channels: Max-Min Solution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305399/","volume":"53","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9620561","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Wireless Fading Relay Channels: Max-Min Solution","sourcePdf":"53tit10-liang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11215S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"133","articleId":"4305399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4305401,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjia Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lingjia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293117400"},{"name":"Parimal Parag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Parimal","lastName":"Parag","id":"37298744400"},{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00c7ois Chamberland","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00c7ois","lastName":"Chamberland","id":"37265048300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305401","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Throughput","Relays","Information theory","Broadcasting","Optimal control","Resource management","Fading","Wireless networks","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","radio links","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service analysis","wireless user-cooperation networks","wireless communication system","service constrained communication system","wireless link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication systems","effective bandwidth","effective capacity","fluid models","quality of service (QoS)","user cooperation","wireless networks"]}],"abstract":"A wireless communication system in which multiple users cooperate to transmit information to a common destination is considered.

A simple user-cooperation scheme that improves performance is proposed. This cooperative scheme is shown to significantly enlarge the achievable rate-region of the service constrained communication system, provided that the quality of the wireless link between cooperating users is better than the individual connections from the users to the intended destination.

The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty-paper coding. The receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over noncooperative transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation rate; in this case, receiver cooperation is more advantageous. Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain over transmitter-only cooperation at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), whereas at high SNR transmitter cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Gain From Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Gain From Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305405/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617863","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305405/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Gain From Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation","sourcePdf":"53tit10-ng-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070889S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305407,"authors":[{"name":"Lawrence Ong","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Ong","id":"37278691500"},{"name":"Mehul Motani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","id":"37278670800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305407","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Decoding","Channel coding","Source coding","Computer networks","Network topology","Wireless sensor networks","Communication system control","Information theory","Digital relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","distributed sensors","encoding","multi-access systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding strategies","feedback sources","correlated sources","sensor network","MACFCS","decode-forward based coding","Slepian-Wolf coding","compress-forward based coding","multiple-access channel with feedback","multihop coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable rates","capacity","correlated sources","generalized feedback","multiple-access channel","multiterminal networks"]}],"abstract":"The multiple-access channel with feedback and correlated sources (MACFCS) models a sensor network in which sensors collect and transmit correlated data to a common sink.

This is followed by either (i) a compress-forward based coding strategy for the multiple-access channel with feedback, or (ii) an existing coding strategy for the multiple-access channel. We also find another achievable region using a multihop coding strategy, which only uses point-to-point coding (no cooperation). From numerical computations, we see that different strategies perform better under certain source correlation structures and network topologies. More specifically, FDS-DF approaches the capacity when (i) the inter-source distance decreases, or (ii) the correlation among the sources gets higher. Furthermore, the cooperative coding strategies considered support larger achievable rate regions than the noncooperative multihop strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305407.pdf","startPage":"3476","endPage":"3497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding Strategies for Multiple-Access Channels With Feedback and Correlated Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305407/","displayDocTitle":"Coding Strategies for Multiple-Access Channels With Feedback and Correlated Sources","volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617864","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding Strategies for Multiple-Access Channels With Feedback and Correlated Sources","sourcePdf":"53tit10-ong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028544S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4305407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305408,"authors":[{"name":"Ayfer Ozgur","affiliation":["IC-ISC-LTHI, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ayfer","lastName":"Ozgur","id":"37400270700"},{"name":"Olivier Leveque","affiliation":["IC-ISC-LTHI, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Leveque","id":"37283975200"},{"name":"Emmanuel Preissmann","affiliation":["Lyc\u00e9e de Meylan, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Preissmann","id":"37563655900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305408","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"The capacity scaling of extended two-dimensional wireless networks is known in the high-attenuation regime, i.e., when the power path loss exponent alpha is greater than 4.

On the contrary, not much is known in the so-called low-attenuation regime when 2lesalphales4. (For one-dimensional networks, the uncharacterized regime is 1lesalphales2.5.) The dichotomy is due to the fact that while communication is highly power-limited in the first case and power-based arguments suffice to get tight upper bounds, the study of the low-attenuation regime requires a more precise analysis of the degrees of freedom involved. In this paper, we study the capacity scaling of extended wireless networks with an emphasis on the low-attenuation regime and show that in the absence of small scale fading, the low attenuation regime does not behave significantly different from the high attenuation regime.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305408.pdf","startPage":"3573","endPage":"3585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling Laws for One- and Two-Dimensional Random Wireless Networks in the Low-Attenuation Regime","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Fading","Attenuation","Upper bound","MIMO","Physical layer","Electromagnetic modeling","Transmitters","Art","Seminars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling law","random wireless networks","low-attenuation regime","high-attenuation regime","information-theoretic upper bound","dichotomy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Cauchy matrix","cut-set bound","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel","scaling laws","transport capacity","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Scaling Laws for One- and Two-Dimensional Random Wireless Networks in the Low-Attenuation Regime","volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305408/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606595","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling Laws for One- and Two-Dimensional Random Wireless Networks in the Low-Attenuation Regime","sourcePdf":"53tit10-ozgur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088308S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305409,"authors":[{"name":"Ayfer Ozgur","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 Informatique et Communications, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ayfer","lastName":"Ozgur","id":"37400270700"},{"name":"Olivier Leveque","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 Informatique et Communications, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Leveque","id":"37283975200"},{"name":"David N.C.

In essence, DLT codes are designed so that the final stage of encoding for erasure correction can be carried out by a low-complexity relay that selectively xors the bit streams generated at each source and transmits the result to the sink. This paper presents results for two-source and four-source networks.

While conventional LDPC codes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel parameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two different channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at the destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer density evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution algorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is developed for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively improved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach to the theoretical DF rate for a wide range of channel parameters, this paper proposes two different forms of bilayer codes: the bilayer-expurgated and bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that the rate of a properly designed bilayer LDPC code can closely approach the theoretical DF limit.

Exploiting an important phenomenon in wireless networks, source burstiness, the cognitive relay utilizes the periods of silence of the terminals to enable cooperation. Therefore, no extra channel resources are allocated for cooperation and the system encounters no bandwidth losses. Two protocols are developed to implement the proposed multiple-access strategy. The maximum stable throughput region and the delay performance of the proposed protocols are characterized. The results reveal that the proposed protocols provide significant performance gains over conventional relaying strategies such as selection and incremental relaying, specially at high spectral efficiency regimes. The rationale is that the lossless bandwidth property of the proposed protocols results in a graceful degradation in the maximum stable throughput with increasing the required rate of communication. On the other hand, conventional relaying strategies suffer from catastrophic performance degradation because of their inherent bandwidth inefficiency that results from allocating specific channel resources for cooperation at the relay. The analysis reveals that the throughput region of the proposed strategy is a subset of its maximum stable throughput region, which is different from random access, where both regions are conjectured to be identical.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305412.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"3677","endPage":"3696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive multiple access via cooperation: Protocol design and performance analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive multiple access via cooperation: Protocol design and performance analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305412/","volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305412/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618915","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive multiple access via cooperation: Protocol design and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"53tit10-sadek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150514S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305415,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Steiner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013IsraelInstitute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Steiner","id":"37283095900"},{"name":"Amichai Sanderovich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013IsraelInstitute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Amichai","lastName":"Sanderovich","id":"37294321300"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013IsraelInstitute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305415","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Transmitters","Decoding","AWGN","Relays","Rayleigh channels","Fading","Channel state information","Nonhomogeneous media","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast cooperation","colocated users","remote single transmitter","Rayleigh-fading channel","channel state information","multilayer broadcast transmission","additive white Gaussian noise","amplify-and-forward technique","compress-and-forward technique","decode-and-forward technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","amplify-and-forward (AF)","code layering","compress-and-forward (CF)","decode-and-forward (DF)","multisession cooperation","single-user broadcasting"]}],"abstract":"This work considers the problem of communication between a remote single transmitter and a destined user, with helping colocated users, over an independent block Rayleigh-fading channel. The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which increases the overall achievable rate, from transmitter to destination. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers have access to perfect channel state information (CSI). We propose, for this setting, a multilayer broadcast transmission approach. The broadcast approach enables enhanced cooperation between the colocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better the channel quality, the more layers that can reliably be decoded. The cooperation between the users is performed over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, with a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used cooperation techniques are studied: amplify-and-forward (AF), compress-and-forward (CF), and decode-and-forward (DF). These techniques are extended by using the broadcast approach for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case, a separate processing of the layers, which includes multisession cooperation is shown to be beneficial. Further, closed-form expressions for infinitely many AF sessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical results for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate how the multisession cooperation outperforms conventional relaying techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","startPage":"3394","endPage":"3412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast Cooperation Strategies for Two Colocated Users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast Cooperation Strategies for Two Colocated Users","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9616123","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast Cooperation Strategies for Two Colocated Users","sourcePdf":"53tit10-steiner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079486S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","articleId":"4305415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305416,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Tabet","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Tabet","id":"37541386300"},{"name":"Sanket Dusad","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sanket","lastName":"Dusad","id":"37326268500"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Delay","Mobile communication","Diversity reception","Wireless networks","Digital relays","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Femtocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel coding","delays","diversity reception","fading channels","multiplexing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff","half-duplex ARQ relay channel","automatic retransmission request protocol","signal-to-noise ratio","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ)","cooperative diversity","diversity multiplexing delay tradeoff","relay channel","wireless networks"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we present an efficient protocol for the delay-limited fading ARQ single relay half-duplex channel. The source is using an automatic retransmission request (ARQ) retransmission protocol to send data to the relay and the destination. When the relay is able to decode, both the relay and the source send the same data to the destination providing additional gains. The proposed protocol exploits two kinds of diversity: (1) space diversity available through the cooperative (relay) terminal, which retransmits the source's signals and (2) ARQ diversity obtained by leveraging the retransmission delay to enhance the reliability. The performance characterization is in terms of the achievable diversity, multiplexing gain and delay tradeoff for a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, we show the benefits of power control on the diversity by controlling the source's power level over the retransmission rounds.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.905001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305416.pdf","startPage":"3797","endPage":"3805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.905001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay Tradeoff in Half-Duplex ARQ Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305416/","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay Tradeoff in Half-Duplex ARQ Relay Channels","volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608002","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay Tradeoff in Half-Duplex ARQ Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"53tit10-tabet-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02525S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4305416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4305417,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy Tannious","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ramy","lastName":"Tannious","id":"37296127000"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37269740500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305417","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Channel With Private Messages","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> The relay channel with private messages (RCPM) is a generalized relay channel model where in addition to the traditional communication from source to destination (assisted by relay), the source has a private message for the relay, and the relay has a private message for the destination.

The scenario under consideration is one in which two ldquopartnersrdquo - node A and node B - cooperate in transmitting information to a single destination; each partner transmits both locally generated information and relayed information that originated at the other partner. A key observation is that node B already knows node A's relayed information (because it originated at node B) and can exploit that knowledge when decoding node A's local information. This leads to an encoding scheme in which each partner transmits the algebraic superposition of its local and relayed information, and the superimposed codeword is interpreted differently at the two receivers i.e., at the other partner and at the destination node, based on their different a priori knowledge. Decoding at the destination is then carried out by iterating between the codewords from the two partners. It is shown via simulation that the proposed scheme provides substantial coding gain over other cooperative diversity techniques, including those based on time multiplexing and signal (Euclidean space) superposition.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305419.pdf","startPage":"3714","endPage":"3722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A network coding approach to cooperative diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A network coding approach to cooperative diversity","volume":"53","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610196","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305419/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network coding approach to cooperative diversity","sourcePdf":"53tit10-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063367S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4305383","articleId":"4305419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305420,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Liang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Liang-Liang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139600"},{"name":"P.

A multisource, multirelay coding scheme is developed. In this scheme, each source's information is sent to its destination nodes via a multirelay route, with the multiple multirelay routes operating concurrently even when they intersect with each other, in the same spirit as code-division multiple access (CDMA). It is found that in the generalization to multiple sources, backward decoding achieves higher rates than sliding-window decoding. The routing structure where a joint backward decoding can be performed is characterized. The achievable rate region is found to combine aspects of both multiple relay and multiple access. Potential applications of this coding scheme to sensor networks are discussed. In particular, the exact capacity for the data downloading problem in sensor networks, where there are multiple sensor sources and one sink or collector node, is established for certain geometries when there is phase fading that is unknown to the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.904783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4305383/04305420.pdf","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.904783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisource, Multidestination, Multirelay Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305420/","displayDocTitle":"Multisource, Multidestination, Multirelay Wireless Networks","volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9620567","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisource, Multidestination, Multirelay Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"53tit10-xie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035738S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"4305383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4305420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305421,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xue","affiliation":["Intel Research Santa Clara, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37266131500"},{"name":"Sumeet Sandhu","affiliation":["Intel Research Santa Clara, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sumeet","lastName":"Sandhu","id":"37266605500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4305421","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A half-duplex relay channel consisting of two relays in a diamond topology is studied.

We examine several subcases of this most general problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays (half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or nonclustered). We first study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a full-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in the direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable performance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF) protocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals have one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the degrees of freedom in the direct link are increased, whereas CF continues to perform optimally. We also study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a half-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly be different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for half-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the half-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC) DMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source\u2013destination pair and multiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the ideal assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real MIMO DMT.

A random-access transmission scheme referred to as the type-based random access (TBRA) is proposed and analyzed. Error exponents of TBRA under noncoherent detection are characterized with respect to the mean transmission rate and the channel-coherence index. For the zero-mean multiaccess fading channels, it is shown that there exists an optimal mean-transmission rate that maximizes the detection-error exponents. The optimal mean-transmission rate can be calculated numerically or estimated using the Gaussian approximation, and it gives a sensor-activation strategy that achieves an optimal allocation of transmission energy to spatial and temporal domains. Numerical examples and simulations are used to compare TBRA with the conventional centralized time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. It is shown that for the zero-mean multiaccess fading channels, TBRA gives substantial improvement in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime whereas for the nonzero mean fading channels, TBRA performs better over a wide range of SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-Based Random Access for Distributed Detection Over Multiaccess Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305425.pdf","startPage":"5032","endPage":"5043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Type-Based Random Access for Distributed Detection Over Multiaccess Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305425/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624741","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-Based Random Access for Distributed Detection Over Multiaccess Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-anandkumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068454S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305426,"authors":[{"name":"Bharath Ananthasubramaniam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305426/4305426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bharath Ananthasubramaniam (S'02) received the Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2004.

The collector employs sophisticated radar and image processing techniques to localize the responding sensor nodes, and (if data modulation is present) multiuser data demodulation techniques to extract the data sent by multiple sensors. The sensors do not need to know their own locations, do not need to communicate with each other, and can be randomly deployed. In this initial exposition, we develop basic insight into the localization capabilities of this approach, ignoring sensor data modulation. This reduces to an idealized one-bit, on-off keyed, communication model in which the the sensors are either ldquoactiverdquo or ldquoinactive,rdquo with the active sensors responding to the collector's beacon without superimposing data modulation. We consider a moving collector, with the sensor reflections creating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-like geometry. However, the collector must employ significant modifications to SAR signal processing for estimation of the location of the active sensors: noncoherent techniques similar to those in noncoherent radar tomography to account for the lack of carrier synchronization between sensor and collector nodes, and decision feedback mechanisms for estimation of the locations of multiple closely spaced active sensors. Measures for localization performance are defined, and the effect of system parameters such as bandwidth, beamwidth and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) on performance is investigated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305426.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896260","startPage":"5044","endPage":"5057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Localization Performance in Imaging Sensor Nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305426/","displayDocTitle":"On Localization Performance in Imaging Sensor Nets","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305426/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"9624742","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Localization Performance in Imaging Sensor Nets","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-ananthasubramaniam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147796S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305427,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Belloni","affiliation":["SMARAD Center of Excellence, Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Communications Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305427/4305427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Belloni (S'03) was born in Castellanza (VA), Italy, in 1978.

MST is a method for modeling the steering vector of antenna arrays of practical interest with arbitrary 2-D or 3-D geometry. It is the product of a sampling matrix (dependent on the antenna array only) and a Vandermonde structured coefficients vector depending on the wavefield only. This allows fast direction-of-arrival (DoA) algorithms designed for linear arrays to be used on arrays with arbitrary configuration. In real-world applications, the calibration measurements used to determine the sampling matrix are corrupted by noise. This impairs the performance of MST-based algorithms. In particular, we study the effect of noisy calibration measurements on subspace-based DoA algorithms using MST. Expressions describing the error in the DoA estimates due to calibration noise and truncation are derived. This allows predicting the performance of MST-based algorithms in real-world applications. The analysis is verified by simulations. We established a link between the optimal number of selected modes and the statistics of calibration noise. We analyze the modeling error when MST is used for 1-D (azimuth) DoA estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305427.pdf","startPage":"4800","endPage":"4810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DoA Estimation Via Manifold Separation for Arbitrary Array Structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Calibration","Vectors","Antenna arrays","Sampling methods","Linear antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Solid modeling","Geometry","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","calibration","direction-of-arrival estimation","geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction of arrival algorithms","real world applications","noisy calibration measurements","Vandermonde structured coefficients vector","arbitrary 3D geometry","arbitrary 2D geometry","antenna arrays","steering vector","manifold separation technique","arbitrary array structures","DoA estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration measurement noise","direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation","effective aperture distribution function (EADF)","error analysis","manifold separation technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"DoA Estimation Via Manifold Separation for Arbitrary Array Structures","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305427/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624743","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DoA Estimation Via Manifold Separation for Arbitrary Array Structures","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-belloni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070825S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305428,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305428/4305428-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angela Sara Cacciapuoti was born in Pozzuoli, Italy, on August 19, 1980.

The proposed system transmits passband pulses using a pulser and antenna, and the receiver front-end downconverts the signal frequency via subsampling, thus, requiring substantially less hardware than the existing direct conversion approach. After the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the signal is projected into complex signal domain to perform matched filtering to not only mitigate the timing sensitivity induced by analog circuit impairment, but also extract the fine time resolution provided by the wideband nature of a UWB signal. The performance and potential usages of these complex signal processing blocks are solved and compared with different complex signal transformations. Based on the proposed architecture, the system specifications and implementation issues are further analyzed and emulated by system-level simulations with measured signal and noise. The subsampling ADC is considered as the most challenging circuit block and has recently been proven with a low-power low-cost fully integrated CMOS solution. Finally, a radio prototype built with discrete components is used for proof of concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305430/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624746","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Subsampling Radio Architecture for Ultrawideband Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Subsampling Radio Architecture for Ultrawideband Communications","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062593S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4305437,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan V.

The problem is posed as an infinite horizon average-cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with the goal of minimizing the average transmission power subject to delay constraints. By using a Lagrangian formulation of the CMDP, we use the concepts of stochastic dominance, submodularity, and multimodularity to prove that the optimal randomized policies are monotone. Three important structural results on the nature of the optimal randomized policies are derived. First, we show that the action space can be exponentially reduced by decomposing the rate allocation problem into bit-loading problem across individual antennas and the total rate allocation based on the current buffer occupancy and channel state. Second, we show that the optimal rate allocation policy is a randomized mixture of two pure policies that are monotonically increasing in the buffer occupancy. Finally, we show that the optimal power allocation is piecewise linear in the delay constraint. These three structural results can be exploited to devise efficient online reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal rate allocation.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.897859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.897859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305437.pdf","startPage":"5069","endPage":"5083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Transmission Control in Fading Channels\u2014A Constrained Markov Decision Process Formulation With Monotone Randomized Policies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Transmission Control in Fading Channels\u2014A Constrained Markov Decision Process Formulation With Monotone Randomized Policies","volume":"55","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305437/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624751","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305437/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Transmission Control in Fading Channels\u2014A Constrained Markov Decision Process Formulation With Monotone Randomized Policies","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-djonin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113258S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305444,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftherios Karipidis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305444/4305444-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eleftherios Karipidis (S'05) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2001 and the M.Sc. degree in communications engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2003.

This arises when a uniform linear antenna antenna (ULA) array is used at the transmitter under far-field line-of-sight propagation conditions, as provisioned in 802.16e and related wireless backhaul scenarios. Two design approaches are pursued: (i) minimizing the total transmitted power subject to providing at least a prescribed received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) to each intended receiver; and (ii) maximizing the minimum received SINR under a total transmit power budget. Whereas these problems have been recently shown to be NP-hard, in general, it is proven here that for Vandermonde channel vectors, it is possible to recast the optimization in terms of the autocorrelation sequences of the sought beam vectors, yielding an equivalent convex reformulation. This affords efficient optimal solution using modern interior point methods. The optimal beam vectors can then be recovered using spectral factorization. Robust extensions for the case of partial channel state information, where the direction of each receiver is known to lie in an interval, are also developed. Interestingly, these also admit convex reformulation. The various optimal designs are illustrated and contrasted in a suite of pertinent numerical experiments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.897903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","startPage":"4916","endPage":"4927","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305444.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Far-Field Multicast Beamforming for Uniform Linear Antenna Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305444/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Far-Field Multicast Beamforming for Uniform Linear Antenna Arrays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624756","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-Field Multicast Beamforming for Uniform Linear Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-karipidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067429S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4305445,"authors":[{"name":"Anna N.

Bit rate reduction is achieved by reducing the number of transmitted samples through downsampling. A Wiener filter is appended at the decoder for further noise reduction. Simulation results agree with theoretical analysis and show that for a first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] process, the proposed codec makes substantial improvements over the classic DPCM and performs close to the rate-distortion bound. The proposed system is then implemented as a low-rate predictive image coder. In addition to apply two-dimensional DPCM, adaptive entropy coding is used to exploit variation in the local statistics of the prediction error image.

The formulation results in a nonstandard POMDP that is nonlinear in the information state. We give sufficient conditions on the cost function, dynamics of the Markov chain and observation probabilities so that the optimal scheduling policy has a threshold structure with respect to a monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) ordering. As a result, the computational complexity of implementing the optimal scheduling policy is inexpensive.

In most digital communication systems, low-pass filters are placed at a transmitter to confine the transmitting waveform to an allocated bandwidth and at a receiver to improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) power ratio. Consequently, if the received waveform is sampled with sufficiently fast rate, the resulting discrete-time signal is band-limited and exhibits a smooth waveform. The method exploits this property for estimating the channel impulse response, via an interpolation formula. The method does not require knowledge of input statistics or the autocorrelation of the received signal. It is free of channel order estimation and thus robust against its overestimation. Moreover, the algorithm is quite efficient because it does not need to compute eigenvalues of a matrix.","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305451.pdf","startPage":"4969","endPage":"4978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896289","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Sampling methods","Interpolation","Digital communication","Digital filters","Low pass filters","Transmitters","Bandwidth","Statistics","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","channel estimation","digital communication","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interpolation","low-pass filters","matrix algebra","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","block transmission system","fractional sampling","interpolation","digital communication systems","low pass filters","bandwidth allocation","signal to noise power ratio","eigenvalues","matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind channel estimation","block transmission","deterministic estimation","fractionally sampled estimation","interpolation","orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic Blind Channel Estimation for a Block Transmission System Using Fractional Sampling and Interpolation","accessionNumber":"9624763","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305451/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic Blind Channel Estimation for a Block Transmission System Using Fractional Sampling and Interpolation","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-murakami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088563S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4305455,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305455/4305455-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soo-Chang Pei (SM'89\u2013F'00) was born in Soo-Auo, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1949.

This advantage is important for the applications of filter design, sampling, and multiplexing in the FRFT domain.

The joint angular-delay domain model leads to a correlation matrix with high dimensionality, which makes direct implementation of a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator unfeasible. We derive low-complexity methods for computing approximate ML estimates that exploit the structure of the covariance matrices. We propose an iterative two-step procedure that alternates between the estimation of the parameters of the concentrated propagation paths and the parameters of the distributed scattering. For the distributed scattering, the estimator first optimizes the parameters describing their time-delay structure. Then, using the estimated time-delay parameters, the parameters of the angular distributions are optimized. We present simulation results and compare the estimated time-delay and angular distributions to the actual distributions, demonstrating that high-quality estimates are obtained. The large sample performance of the estimator is studied by establishing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and comparing it to the variances of the estimates. The simulations show that the variance of the proposed estimation technique reaches the CRLB for relatively small sample size for most parameters, and no bias is observed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305457.pdf","startPage":"4775","endPage":"4790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Angular- and Delay-Domain MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation Using Approximate ML Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Delay estimation","MIMO","Parameter estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Covariance matrix","Acoustic scattering","Scattering parameters","Acoustic propagation","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao lower bound","maximum-likelihood estimator","correlation matrix","multiple-input multiple-output channel sounding measurements","distributed scattering component","concentrated propagation paths","approximate ML method","parameter estimation","joint angular-delay-domain MIMO propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel parameter estimation","maximum-likelihood estimation","multipath channels","radio propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Angular- and Delay-Domain MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation Using Approximate ML Method","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305457/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624767","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Angular- and Delay-Domain MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation Using Approximate ML Method","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-ribeiro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08462S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305461,"authors":[{"name":"H.

For the generalization, a new system parameter called repetition index is introduced whose value is unity for previously reported special cases. By choosing a repetition index larger than unity, the number of received blocks needed for blind identification is significantly reduced compared to all previously reported methods. This feature makes the method more realistic especially in wireless environments where the channel state is usually fast-varying. Given the number of received blocks available, the minimum value of repetition index is derived. Theoretical limit allows the proposed method to perform blind identification using only three received blocks in absence of noise. In practice, the number of received blocks needed to yield a satisfactory bit-error-rate (BER) performance is usually on the order of half the block size. Simulation results not only demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to perform blind identification using fewer received blocks, but also show that in some cases system performance can be improved by choosing a repetition index larger than needed. Simulation of the proposed method over time-varying channels clearly demonstrates the improvement over previously reported methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-Based Blind Channel Identification for Cyclic Prefix Systems Using Few Received Blocks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896262","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4305424/04305463.pdf","startPage":"4979","endPage":"4993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-Based Blind Channel Identification for Cyclic Prefix Systems Using Few Received Blocks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4305463/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624773","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-Based Blind Channel Identification for Cyclic Prefix Systems Using Few Received Blocks","sourcePdf":"55tsp10-su.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104148S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4305424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4305424","articleId":"4305463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305469,"authors":[{"name":"Rainfield Yutian Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4305424/4305469/4305469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rainfield Yutian Yen received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1966, the M.S. degree from Washington State University, Pullman, WA, in 1968, and the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University, New York, in 1972, all in electrical engineering.","He joined TRW, Washington Operation, in 1972 as a Member of Technical Staff working in the area of sonar signal processing, adaptive beamforming, and underwater countermeasure system engineering.

An analytical redundancy methodology was utilized to reduce the total number of redundant road-wheel angle (RWA) sensors in a triply redundant RWA-based SBW system while maintaining a high level of reliability. A full-state observer was designed using the combined model of the vehicle and SBW system to estimate the vehicle-body sideslip angle. The steering angle was then estimated from the observed and measured states of the vehicle (body sideslip angle and yaw rate) as well as the current input to the SBW electric motor(s). A fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm was developed using a majority voting scheme, which was then used to detect faulty sensor(s) to maintain safe drivability. The proposed analytical redundancy-based FDI algorithms and the linearized vehicle model were modeled in SIMULINK. Simulation results show that the proposed analytical redundancy-based FDI algorithm provides the same level of fault tolerance as in an SBW system with full hardware redundancy against single-point failures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305477.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2869","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Redundancy-Based Fault Detection and Isolation Algorithm for a Road-Wheel Control Subsystem in a Steer-By-Wire System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Redundancy-Based Fault Detection and Isolation Algorithm for a Road-Wheel Control Subsystem in a Steer-By-Wire System","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305477/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624670","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Redundancy-Based Fault Detection and Isolation Algorithm for a Road-Wheel Control Subsystem in a Steer-By-Wire System","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-anwar-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068591S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4305478,"authors":[{"name":"Teresa Araujo","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Group, Institute of Systems and Robotics Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal","Department of Mathematics, Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305470/4305478/4305478-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Teresa Ara\u00fajo received the Diploma degree in applied mathematics from the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Lisbon, Portugal, in 1991 and 2004, respectively.

After deriving the architecture of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) MIMO channel estimator, closed-form expressions for the maximum information throughput that is sustained by the MAI-affected MIMO links are provided. Then, we present a novel power allocation algorithm for achieving the resulting link capacity. Several numerical results are provided to compare the performance achieved by the proposed power-allocation algorithm with that of the corresponding MIMO system that works in MAI-free environments and is equipped with error free (e.g., perfect) channel estimates. By so doing, we are able to give an insight on the ultimate performance loss that is induced in MIMO systems by spatially colored MAI and imperfect channel estimates.

Solutions based on distributed antenna systems have been tested by installing several 900-MHz transmitters inside and outside of a 4000-m tunnel and measuring the propagation in different conditions. The measurements have been used to model the effects of tunnel propagation, including curves, trains passing from the outside to the inside, and the effect of two trains passing inside the tunnel. All cases have been tested by comparing solutions using isofrequency and multifrequency distributed transmitters inside the tunnel. The improvements of signal-to-noise ratio and the reduction of the blocking effects of two trains passing have demonstrated the advantages of using isofrequency distributed antenna systems in tunnels. Finally, a complete propagation model combining both modal analysis and ray tracing has been applied to predict the propagation loss inside and outside these tunnels, and results have been compared with the measurements. The model has proven to be very useful for radio planning in new railway networks.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305483.pdf","startPage":"2870","endPage":"2879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements and Modeling of Distributed Antenna Systems in Railway Tunnels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305483/","displayDocTitle":"Measurements and Modeling of Distributed Antenna Systems in Railway Tunnels","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624675","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305483/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements and Modeling of Distributed Antenna Systems in Railway Tunnels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-brisorodriguez-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071132S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4305493,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic, University of York, York, UK","Center for Studies in Telecommunication, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio De Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305493/4305493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo C. de Lamare received the Diploma in electronic engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From January 2004 to June 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Center for Studies in Telecommunications, PUC-Rio, and from July 2005 to January 2006, he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Signal Processing Laboratory, UFRJ.

Based upon the interpolated MMSE and CMV solutions, we present computationally efficient stochastic gradient and exponentially weighted recursive least squares type algorithms for both receiver and interpolator filters in the supervised and blind modes of operation. A convergence analysis of the algorithms and a discussion of the convergence properties of the method are carried out for both modes of operation. Simulation experiments for a downlink scenario show that the proposed structures achieve a superior bit-error-rate convergence and steady-state performance to previously reported reduced-rank receivers at lower complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication","Finite impulse response filter","Multipath channels","Adaptive filters","Interference constraints","Multiple access interference","Stochastic processes","Least squares methods","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","FIR filters","interference suppression","interpolation","mean square error methods","multipath channels","radiofrequency interference","recursive filters","spread spectrum communication","stochastic programming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-error-rate convergence","exponentially weighted recursive least squares type algorithms","stochastic gradient","multiple-path propagation effects","multiple-access interference","interpolated constrained minimum-variance solutions","interpolated minimum mean-squared error","multipath channels","adaptive interpolators","interpolated FIR filters","DS-CDMA systems","adaptive interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive algorithms","direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA)","multiuser detection","reduced-rank receivers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305493","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899931","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899931","startPage":"2457","endPage":"2474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Interference Suppression for DS-CDMA Systems Based on Interpolated FIR Filters With Adaptive Interpolators in Multipath Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Interference Suppression for DS-CDMA Systems Based on Interpolated FIR Filters With Adaptive Interpolators in Multipath Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305493/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305493/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624705","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Interference Suppression for DS-CDMA Systems Based on Interpolated FIR Filters With Adaptive Interpolators in Multipath Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-delamare-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12115S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305495,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305495/4305495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2005.","From 2000 to 2002, he was a Soft Engineer with the Datang Telecom Inc. and Vimicro Corporation, Beijing.

In this paper, we propose a technique to achieve joint channel estimation and symbol detection for OSTBC in frequency-selective fading channels. The key observation is that a multiple-input-single-output system, which is using OSTBC, can be transformed into an equivalent single-input-multiple-output system using the implicit redundancy in OSTBC. This allows a probabilistic method, known as the Baum-Welch algorithm, to be applied at each output branch. As each output branch is a function of the same input, redundant information may be exchanged between the multiple branches to improve detection performance. The proposed technique does not require multiple antennas at the receiver and only has moderate computational complexity. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) is also developed to facilitate performance analysis. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305495.pdf","endPage":"2486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection for Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Coding Systems in Frequency-Selective Channels","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899942","startPage":"2475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection for Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Coding Systems in Frequency-Selective Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305495/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9624707","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305495/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection for Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Coding Systems in Frequency-Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-ding-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07325S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305496,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Fuchs","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Fuchs","id":"37416035000"},{"name":"Giovanni Del Galdo","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Del Galdo","id":"37427000100"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4305496","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":619},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Scheduling algorithm","Wireless communication","Degradation","Sorting","Channel state information","Statistics","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","scheduling","space division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity scheduling","space time frequency scheduling","SDMA","wireless MIMO communication","multiuser MIMO communication","time division multiple access","frequency division multiple access","space division multiple access","spatially correlated channels","ProSched","orthogonal projections","tree based sorting algorithm","channel state information","channel statistics","realistic correlation","decision making process","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","scheduling","space-division multiple access (SDMA)","space-division multiplexing","time-division multiple access (TDMA)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a low-complexity fair scheduling algorithm for wireless multiuser MIMO communication systems in which users are multiplexed via time-, frequency-, and space-division multiple access (SDMA) schemes. In such systems, the transmission quality considerably degrades if users with spatially correlated channels are to be served at the same time and frequency. The approach presented here works with both zero- and nonzero-forcing SDMA precoding schemes by deciding, for each time and frequency slot, which users are to be served in order to maximize the precoding performance. The number of users is not a fixed parameter of the algorithm (as often assumed for other schedulers present in the literature), but it is also adjusted in accordance to the channel conditions. While smaller SDMA groups allow us to transmit with a higher average power per user, larger groups lead to higher multiplexing gains. Our algorithm ProSched is based on a novel interpretation of the precoding process using orthogonal projections which permit us to estimate the precoding results of all user combinations of interest with significantly reduced complexity. In addition, the possible user combinations are efficiently treated with the help of a tree-based sorting algorithm. The ProSched takes advantage of a perfect channel state information, when available, or, alternatively, of second-order channel statistics. The individual-user quality-of-service requirements can be considered in the decision-making process. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated with simulations based on the IlmProp channel model, which features realistic correlation in space, time, and frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305496.pdf","startPage":"2775","endPage":"2784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Space\u2013Time\u2013Frequency Scheduling for MIMO Systems With SDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305496/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Space\u2013Time\u2013Frequency Scheduling for MIMO Systems With SDMA","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624708","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305496/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Space\u2013Time\u2013Frequency Scheduling for MIMO Systems With SDMA","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-fuchs-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065561S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305497,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305497/4305497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feifei Gao (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree from the McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2004.

This combination is one of the most promising candidates for future wireless local area network implementations. However, one drawback of OFDM systems is the high peak-to-average power ratio, which imposes strong requirements on the linearity of power amplifiers (PAs). Such linearity requirements translate into high back-off that results in low power efficiency. In order to improve power efficiency, a PA nonlinearity cancellation (PANC) technique is introduced in this paper. This technique reduces the nonlinear distortion effects on the received signal. The performance of the new technique is evaluated with simulations, which show significant power efficiency improvements. To obtain meaningful results for comparison purposes, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the bit error rate performance of an SDMA-OFDM system subject to PA nonlinearities. In addition, a novel channel estimation technique that combines frequency- and time-domain channel estimation with PANC is also presented. Simulation results show the robustness of the cancellation method also when channel estimation is included.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305499.pdf","startPage":"2499","endPage":"2516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver Cancellation Technique for Nonlinear Power Amplifier Distortion in SDMA\u2013OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305499/","displayDocTitle":"Receiver Cancellation Technique for Nonlinear Power Amplifier Distortion in SDMA\u2013OFDM Systems","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624710","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305499/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver Cancellation Technique for Nonlinear Power Amplifier Distortion in SDMA\u2013OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-gregorio-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1399S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305503,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhou Huang","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA","Texas Instrumenits, Inc., Germantown, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305503/4305503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaozhou Huang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in wireless communication from Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, the M.S. degrees in physics science and digital signal processing from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, North Dartmouth, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, in 2006.","She was with the NORTEL Research Laboratory, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, from 1996 to 1998.

In the future, wireless OFDM systems are expected to operate at high carrier frequencies, high speed, and high throughput for mobile reception, where fast time-varying fading channels are encountered. Channel variation destroys the orthogonality among the subcarriers and leads to intercarrier interference (ICI). ICI poses a significant limitation on wireless OFDM systems. The aim of this paper is to find an efficient method of providing reliable communications using OFDM in fast time-varying fading channels. It is observed that ICI power arises from a few adjacent subcarriers. This observation motivates us to design low-complexity -tap ICI equalizers. To employ these equalizers, channel state information is also required. In this paper, we also design a pilot-aided minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation scheme for a time-varying wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scatters channel model. The MMSE channel estimator utilizes the statistical channel properties to achieve computational efficiency. Simulation results show that our proposed low-complexity ICI suppression scheme, which incorporates the -tap equalizer with the MMSE channel estimator, can significantly improve the performance of OFDM systems in fast time-varying fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305503.pdf","startPage":"2517","endPage":"2528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Efficient Intercarrier Interference Mitigation for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305503/","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Efficient Intercarrier Interference Mitigation for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624713","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305503/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Efficient Intercarrier Interference Mitigation for OFDM Systems in Time-Varying Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-huang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118082S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305504,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00c1ndor Imre","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305504/4305504-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["S\u00e1ndor Imre (M'00) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, the Dr. Univ. degree in probability theory and mathematical statistics, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE), Budapest, Hungary, in 1993, 1996, and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Telecommunications, where he is also a Scientific Director with Mobile Innovation Centre.

The tracked correlation is used to compute side information that assists in distributed source compression. The proposed virtual space-time block coding and RLS-based compression side information are shown to improve energy efficiency at distributed nodes compared to previously proposed schemes with single-input-single-output communication. A semi-analytical approach is developed for energy efficiency analysis over different channel conditions and transmission distances. The energy efficiency performance of the proposed design is evaluated on real WSN data. The results show that the proposed integrated system outperforms conventional designs beyond certain transmission distance thresholds and leads to lower decoding errors, which makes it a good candidate for energy-aware WSNs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305507.pdf","startPage":"2630","endPage":"2640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Processing-Aided Distributed Compression in Virtual MIMO-Based Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Distributed computing","Adaptive systems","Source coding","MIMO","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Least squares methods","Block codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","block codes","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","recursive estimation","source coding","space-time codes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-processing-aided distributed compression","wireless sensor networks","adaptive signal-processing-aided distributed source coding scheme","virtual multiple-input-multiple-output communication","spatiotemporal correlations","recursive least squares algorithm","adaptive correlation tracking algorithm","distributed source compression","virtual space-time block coding","single-input-single-output communication","transmission distance thresholds","decoding errors","MIMO techniques","semi-analytical approach","energy efficiency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive signal processing","distributed compression","energy efficiency","virtual multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (V-MIMO)","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Signal-Processing-Aided Distributed Compression in Virtual MIMO-Based Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624715","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-Processing-Aided Distributed Compression in Virtual MIMO-Based Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-jayaweera-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122426S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305509,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083000"},{"name":"Seong Rag Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunications Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Rag","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279276800"},{"name":"In-Kyeong Choi","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunications Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Kyeong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37365950800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4305509","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Downlink","Array signal processing","Feedback","Diversity reception","Bit error rate","Quantization","Block codes","Performance analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","error statistics","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","statistical multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channels","average bit error rate","limited feedback","OFDM downlink","selection diversity","statistical eigen-beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna diversity","average bit error rate (BER)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","statistical eigen-beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Statistical eigen-beamforming is shown to be effective over a spatially correlated fading channel.

In particular, the asymptotic expression allows us to gain insight to statistical eigen-beamforming with selection diversity in terms of array gain and diversity order.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","startPage":"2931","endPage":"2940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Eigen-Beamforming With Selection Diversity for Spatially Correlated OFDM Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Eigen-Beamforming With Selection Diversity for Spatially Correlated OFDM Downlink","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624680","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Eigen-Beamforming With Selection Diversity for Spatially Correlated OFDM Downlink","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-jchoi-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061645S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4305509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305510,"authors":[{"name":"Junghoon Lee","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37716187200"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungeun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407202900"},{"name":"Keuk-Joon Bang","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Keuk-Joon","lastName":"Bang","id":"37365431500"},{"name":"Sungkeun Cha","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungkeun","lastName":"Cha","id":"37711351500"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4305510","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Frequency conversion","Parameter estimation","Computational complexity","Multiple signal classification","Band pass filters","Filtering","Information technology","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","frequency estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","rotational invariance technique","signal parameter estimation","OFDMA uplink systems","carrier frequency offset estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator based on the system of estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique is proposed for interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access uplink systems.

The capacity in MIMO systems with transmitter CSI can be achieved via two schemes: 1) a multiple-coding scheme with temporal and spatial water filling and 2) a single-coding scheme with temporal and spatial water filling. The former requires an infinite number of different codes, and the latter one requires interblock coding and, therefore, a very long code. We propose three simple but powerful methods for transforming the MIMO fading channel into a set of additive white Gaussian noise channels to which standard codes for the Gaussian channel can then be applied. We show through a number of examples that these methods can closely approach channel capacity. As a by-product, the closed-form expressions of the marginal probability density function of the ordered and unordered eigenvalues of Wishart matrices are derived.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Rayleigh channels","Channel state information","Fading","Transmitters","Filling","Decoding","Additive white noise","Code standards","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","block codes","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wishart matrices","unordered eigenvalues","probability density function","additive white Gaussian noise channels","interblock coding","spatial water filling","receiver","transmitter","Rayleigh fading channels","multiple input multiple output channel","capacity approaching coding","power adaptation","channel state information","multiple coding","MIMO fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information (CSI)","multiple coding","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","partitioned channel inversion"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900489","startPage":"2965","endPage":"2975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305511.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-Approaching Multiple Coding for MIMO Rayleigh Fading Systems With Transmit Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Capacity-Approaching Multiple Coding for MIMO Rayleigh Fading Systems With Transmit Channel State Information","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9624682","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","volume":"56","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305511/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-Approaching Multiple Coding for MIMO Rayleigh Fading Systems With Transmit Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-jliu-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076867S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305513,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00d6khan Korkmaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA","ArrayComm, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305470/4305513/4305513-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["G\u00f6khan Korkmaz (S'05\u2013M'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2000 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","Since October 2006, he has been a System Research Engineer with ArrayComm, San Jose, CA.

One of the algorithms is a pilot data transmission technique; while pilots in a conventional method are transmitted continuously, they are cyclically transmitted over each transmit antenna in the proposed algorithm. Hence, when compared to the conventional method, code allocation efficiency and more powerful transmission for unmodulated pilot channels could be achieved. The other is a weighted average (WA) method in which code-timing acquisition is achieved by averaging the estimated delays by weight.

Based on the analysis in this paper, the performance of the WA method is better than the equal-gain average method.

In a multihop mesh system, the close interaction between topology control and routing selection affects the system throughput of a wireless network. This paper proposes a novel joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol for a multiradio multichannel wireless mesh network to exploit both channel diversity and spatial reusability. It resides between medium access control and the network layer and aims to improve the network throughput by coordinating transmission power, channel assignment, and route selection among multiple nodes in a distributed way. JTCR jointly coordinates the transmission power at each node, the channel selection on each wireless interface, and the route selection among interfaces based on the traffic information that is measured and exchanged among two-hop neighbor nodes. An equivalent channel air time metric (ECATM) is presented to quantify the difference of various adjustment candidates. This protocol achieves the efficient utilization of available channels by selecting a feasible adjustment candidate with the smallest EC ATM value and coordinating affected nodes to realize the adjustment. Our NS-2-based simulation results show that the network throughput can be significantly improved by using our proposed solution.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","startPage":"3123","endPage":"3136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305515.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Topology Control and Routing in IEEE 802.11-Based Multiradio Multichannel Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305515/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Topology Control and Routing in IEEE 802.11-Based Multiradio Multichannel Mesh Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624685","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Topology Control and Routing in IEEE 802.11-Based Multiradio Multichannel Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-lchen-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07107S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305517,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Li","affiliation":["Cerion, Inc., Frisco, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305517/4305517-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongdong Li (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

We propose an iteratively analytical process to determine the dynamic capacity in CDMA systems with unequal BS power by considering the correlation and interaction among BS powers. Simulation results show that the Erlang capacity is significantly different by modeling the BS power as a random variate instead of a constant value. We also show that correlation among BS powers can be up to 0.13, and the reduction in Erlang capacity can be up to 30%. To efficiently evaluate the dynamic Erlang capacity and correlation among BS powers, a closed-form expression of the capacity in terms of certain outage and blocking probabilities is obtained by using the distribution of the BS power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305517.pdf","startPage":"2529","endPage":"2544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Dynamic Capacity in the Forward Link of CDMA Systems With Correlated BS Powers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Capacity planning","Traffic control","Power system modeling","Closed-form solution","Vehicle dynamics","Analytical models","Interference","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel capacity","code division multiple access","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic capacity","CDMA systems","forward link capacity","code division multiple access system","correlated base station power","Erlang capacity","correlation","closed form expression","outage probability","blocking probability","cdma2000 system","soft-handoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blocking","Erlang capacity","forward link","outage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Dynamic Capacity in the Forward Link of CDMA Systems With Correlated BS Powers","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305517/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624719","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dynamic Capacity in the Forward Link of CDMA Systems With Correlated BS Powers","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-li-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105016S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4305518,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos A.

The algorithms aim to minimize the blocking probability of new calls and the dropping probability of handoff calls in channelized systems, simultaneously considering three types of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) constraints: 1) the cochannel; 2) the adjacent channel; and 3) the cosite. The proposed algorithms add a number of mechanisms to the canonical GA in order to increase their efficiency and velocity of convergence. Such mechanisms are adaptive parameters, random immigrants, a greedy policy, a reservoir to assist the initial population, a truncation selection scheme, and a three-point crossover. The GASC allows call switching between channels during the call holding time, whereas the GALC does not allow it. Computer simulations evaluated the performance of the proposed models considering a benchmark cellular environment formed by 49 cells with 70 channels and nonuniform traffic load characteristics. The impact of EMC constraints on the blocking probability of new calls and on the dropping probability of handoff calls was assessed, and the proposed models reached suitable performance. Equipment failure tests showed robust performance of the two adaptive GA schemes during the fault occurrence and recovery capability after the fault ends. The results suggest that the GASC has lower overall blocking probability of new calls than the GALC; however, the GALC may do better than the GASC in a number of combinations of handoff requests and EMC restrictions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898411","startPage":"2685","endPage":"2696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305518.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Dynamic Channel Assignment in Mobile Cellular Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305518/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Dynamic Channel Assignment in Mobile Cellular Communication Systems","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305518/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9624720","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Dynamic Channel Assignment in Mobile Cellular Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-lima-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076608S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4305520,"authors":[{"name":"Li Bin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Li Bin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37398011400"},{"name":"Soung Chang Liew","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Soung Chang","lastName":"Liew","id":"37279300600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4305520","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":577},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305520","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular networks","Throughput","Frequency","Wireless networks","Degradation","Large-scale systems","Wireless LAN","Switches","Protocols","Explosives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","frequency allocation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network capacity","adjacent cells","frequency-channel assignment","HFD","hidden-node-free design","throughput instability","throughput distribution","carrier-sensing mechanism","packet collisions","carrier-sensing range","IEEE 802.11","cellular WiFi networks","hidden-node removal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden-node problem (HN)","IEEE 802.11","modeling","performance evaluation","protocol design"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the hidden-node phenomenon (HN) in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. HN occurs when nodes outside the carrier-sensing range of each other are nevertheless close enough to interfere with each other. As a result, the carrier-sensing mechanism may fail to prevent packet collisions. HN can cause many performance problems, including throughput degradation, unfair throughput distribution among flows, and throughput instability. The contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) This is a first attempt to identify a set of conditions - which we called hidden-node-free design (HFD) - that completely remove HN in 802.11 wireless networks. 2) We derive variations of HFD for large-scale cellular WiFi networks consisting of many wireless LAN cells. These HFDs are not only HN-free, but they also reduce exposed nodes at the same time so that the network capacity is improved. 3) We investigate the problem of frequency-channel assignment to adjacent cells. We find that with HFD, careful assignment in which adjacent cells use different frequency channels does not improve the overall network capacity (in unit of bits per second per frequency channel). Indeed, given frequency channels, a simple scheme with overlaid cellular WiFi networks in which each cell uses all frequencies yields near-optimal performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305520.pdf","startPage":"2641","endPage":"2654","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden-Node Removal and Its Application in Cellular WiFi Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Hidden-Node Removal and Its Application in Cellular WiFi Networks","htmlLink":"/document/4305520/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9624722","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden-Node Removal and Its Application in Cellular WiFi Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-ljiang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033606S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","articleId":"4305520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4305522,"authors":[{"name":"Mario E.

We assume that perfect knowledge of the channel correlation is available at the receiver and find upper and lower bounds on the mutual information for Gaussian input signals. We prove that for a generic input covariance matrix, the gap between these two bounds at high transmit powers does not exceed a certain value, which depends on the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the receive correlation matrix. We also show that in a system with uncorrelated transmit antennas and correlated receive antennas and with uniform power distribution over the transmit antennas, these bounds are asymptotically tight for a large number of transmit antennas. We show that when the correlation information is available at the transmitter, the transmitting strategy that maximizes the mutual information lower bound is to transmit toward the directions of the eigenvectors of the transmit correlation matrix. We further derive upper and lower bounds on the mutual information of a MIMO multiple-access channel with imperfect channel estimation at the receiver. We also prove that when the input power at each user is uniformly distributed over its transmit antennas, the bounds on the mutual information are asymptotically tight for Gaussian input signals, and this tightness increases when the number of users increases. Numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate theoretical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305526.pdf","startPage":"2798","endPage":"2806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Channel Uncertainty on the Mutual Information of MIMO Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Mutual information","MIMO","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation","Covariance matrix","Rayleigh channels","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect channel estimation","MIMO multiple access channel","transmit correlation matrix","mutual information lower bound","receive correlation matrix","input covariance matrix","Gaussian input signals","correlated Rayleigh fading","multiple input multiple output channel","channel estimation error","MIMO fading channels","channel uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading correlation","imperfect channel estimation","multiple-access channel (MAC)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","mutual information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Channel Uncertainty on the Mutual Information of MIMO Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305526/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624726","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Channel Uncertainty on the Mutual Information of MIMO Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-musavian-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069597S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305528,"authors":[{"name":"Claude Oestges","affiliation":["Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, Brussels, Belgium","Microwave Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305470/4305528/4305528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claude Oestges received the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree in applied science from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","From 1996 to 2000, he was an Assistant Lecturer with the Microwave Laboratory, UCL.

Previously published work on dynamic multiuser subcarrrier allocation for OFDMA systems with single-input-single-output (SISO) channels are surveyed. A near-optimal low-complexity algorithm for SISO systems, which is structurally similar to the algorithm by Rhee and Cioffi, is extended to the case of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems in this paper. The optimality and adaptability of this algorithm are analyzed by formulating an assignment problem and comparing with one optimal and two extended suboptimal strategies proposed based on previous work. Consideration of a MIMO channel creates further issues for the subcarrier-allocation process. In particular, methods whereby an appropriate subcarrier allocation may be exploited to minimize the effects of correlation in MIMO channels are of considerable interest. Several novel variants of the algorithm (referred to as ldquoschemesrdquo) are proposed and evaluated for MIMO systems employing both space-time block coding (STBC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) in both uncorrelated and correlated fading channels. Simulation results identify the most suitable schemes for both STBC and SM and, in particular, show that substantial improvements in performance (in terms of bit-error rate) in correlated channels can be achieved by means of suitable subcarrier allocation. In uncorrelated channels, the best scheme can offer approximately 7-dB gain over the conventional MIMO channel; in highly correlated channels, even more substantial improvements (>11-dB gain for STBC, >20-dB gain for SM) in performance can also be achieved, demonstrating the ability of a well-designed subcarrier-allocation scheme to mitigate the debilitating effects of correlation on MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation in MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305530.pdf","startPage":"2990","endPage":"3005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation in MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305530/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624688","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation in MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-peng-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038006S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4305530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305532,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed scheme relies on using space-time spreading sequences that are constructed from the time-domain user signatures combined with spatial channel information that corresponds to multiple transmit antennas. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the multiple-access interference in both flat- and multipath-fading channels. At the same time, it achieves the maximum possible diversity order that is offered by the combination of multiple transmit antennas and multipath fading. To further improve the performance in overloaded CDMA systems, the proposed linear precoding method is combined with a nonlinear operation known as vector perturbation (based on applying modulo operation to minimize the transmit energy). Throughout the paper, we assume that 1) the channel state information is known at the transmitter, 2) the modulation is binary phase-shift keying, and 3) the receivers are simply based on linear filters that are matched to the time-domain user signatures. We use a recent work of Reynolds et al. as a baseline for comparison. Numerical results show that our proposed method outperforms that of Reynolds et al. in both flat and multipath channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305473/04305532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305473","startPage":"2590","endPage":"2602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time Precoding for Downlink Transmission in Multiple Antenna CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time Precoding for Downlink Transmission in Multiple Antenna CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624730","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305532/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time Precoding for Downlink Transmission in Multiple Antenna CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-razavizadeh-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205657S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4305473","articleId":"4305532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305534,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Rajaei Salmasi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305534/4305534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farzad Rajaei Salmasi (S'99\u2013M'02) received the B.S. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1994, the M.Sc. degree from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2002, all in electrical engineering.","From 1999 to 2002, he worked as a Research Assistant for the Advanced Motor Drives and Hybrid Vehicles Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A&M University, where his main research area was the design of advanced control systems for electric motors and the development of control strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

Correlations of rms delay spread with excess path loss and distance are on the order of 0.5 and 0.4, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","startPage":"2831","endPage":"2843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medium- and Large-Scale Characterization of UMTS-Allocated Frequency Division Duplex Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Medium- and Large-Scale Characterization of UMTS-Allocated Frequency Division Duplex Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624689","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305535/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium- and Large-Scale Characterization of UMTS-Allocated Frequency Division Duplex Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-salous-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069213S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305538,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we apply a new evolutionary algorithm, called particle swarm optimization (PSO), to develop a suboptimal MUD strategy. The decorrelating detector (DD) or linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector is used as the first stage to initialize the PSO-based MUD. Then, the PSO algorithm is applied to detect the received data bit by optimizing an objective function incorporating the linear system of the DD or LMMSE detector. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed decorrelating PSO and LMMSE-PSO MUD are promising and outperform the decorrelating and LMMSE MUD with a slight increase in computation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305538.pdf","startPage":"3006","endPage":"3013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Multiuser Detector for CDMA Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Multiuser Detector for CDMA Communications","volume":"56","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9624691","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305538/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based Multiuser Detector for CDMA Communications","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-soo-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100203S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4305539,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangquan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA","NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shuangquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280447900"},{"name":"Ali Abdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Abdi","id":"37270167000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4305539","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Intersymbol interference","Channel estimation","Additive noise","Analytical models","Bayesian methods","Gaussian noise","Digital signal processing","Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","Bayes methods","channel estimation","Golay codes","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-specified integrated circuit","field programmable gate array","DSP","additive Gaussian noise","Bayesian CRLB","linear minimum mean-square error estimator","Cramer-Rao lower bound","linear unbiased estimator","optimal training sequence","intersymbol interference channels","multiple-input multiple-output","polyphase sequences","uncorrelated Golay complementary sets","MIMO ISI channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","complementary sets of sequences","frequency selective","Golay sequences","intersymbol interference (ISI)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","training sequences"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, optimal training sequence design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) intersymbol interference channels is addressed, and several novel low-complexity channel estimators are proposed, using uncorrelated Golay complementary sets of polyphase sequences. A polyphase sequence is a sequence of complex numbers, each of unit magnitude. The theoretical analysis and simulation show that, when the additive noise is Gaussian, the proposed best linear unbiased estimator achieves the minimum possible classical Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) if the channel coefficients are regarded as unknown deterministics. On the other hand, the proposed linear minimum mean-square error estimator attains the minimum possible Bayesian CRLB when the underlying channel coefficients are Gaussian and independent of the additive Gaussian noise. The proposed channel estimators not only achieve the best estimation performance but can also be implemented with low complexity via DSP or application-specified integrated circuit/field programmable gate array. This has been possible due to the special structures intrinsic to uncorrelated Golay complementary sets of polyphase sequences, which make the proposed channel estimators ready to use in the practical MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO ISI Channel Estimation Using Uncorrelated Golay Complementary Sets of Polyphase Sequences","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.899947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305539.pdf","startPage":"3024","endPage":"3039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.899947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO ISI Channel Estimation Using Uncorrelated Golay Complementary Sets of Polyphase Sequences","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624692","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO ISI Channel Estimation Using Uncorrelated Golay Complementary Sets of Polyphase Sequences","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-swang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055709S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4305539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305540,"authors":[{"name":"Boon Sim Thian","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305470/4305540/4305540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Boon Sim Thian received the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2005.

Conventional receivers for CDMA systems utilized interference cancellation (IC) schemes, with the RAKE receiver as an initial data estimator. However, the RAKE receiver generates inaccurate data estimates due the interference that is caused by the cross correlation between the spreading codes. This inaccurate data estimate leads to significant error propagation to the subsequent stages and thus degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance. Our proposed scheme overcomes the problem by using a more accurate initial data estimator. It consists of an equalizer for obtaining initial data estimation, followed by several stages of parallel IC (PIC). Computer simulation results show that the BER curves of our proposed scheme do not encounter an error floor under all channel conditions; in contrast, the BER curves of the conventional RAKE-PIC receiver are constrained by an irreducible error floor.

The locations of ldquounlocalizedrdquo nodes can be estimated using range or distance estimates from location-aware ldquoanchorrdquo nodes. In the absence of LOS between the unlocalized and anchor nodes, e.g., in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be significantly biased. The direct incorporation of these biased range estimates into practical location estimators, such as the least squares estimator, without the mitigation of these bias errors, can potentially lead to severe degradation in the accuracy of node-location estimates. On the other hand, with certain geometries of anchor nodes, NLOS range estimates can be used to improve the accuracy of location estimation. Furthermore, discarding the biased range estimates may not be a viable option, as the number of range estimates available may be limited. We present a novel NLOS-bias mitigation scheme based on LP, that 1) allows us to incorporate NLOS range information into location estimation, but 2) does not allow NLOS bias errors to degrade node-localization accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","volume":"56","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9624695","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4305542/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"NLOS Mitigation Using Linear Programming in Ultrawideband Location-Aware Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLOS Mitigation Using Linear Programming in Ultrawideband Location-Aware Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-venkatesh-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140167S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4305544,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305544/4305544-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wan Choi (S'03\u2013M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.","From 1998 to 2003, he was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at the R&D Division, Korea Telecom Freetel, researching 3G CDMA systems.

The reasons for this include availability wherever there is cellular coverage and an instantaneous response. Due to these advantages, technology that enhances the accuracy of the method has received considerable interest. This paper presents a new adaptive enhanced cell-ID (AECID) localization method. The method first clusters high-precision position measurements, e.g., assisted-GPS measurements. The high-precision position measurements of each cluster are tagged with the same set of detectable neighbor cells, auxiliary connection information (e.g., the radio-access bearer), as well as quantized auxiliary measurements [e.g., roundtrip time]. The algorithm proceeds by computation and tagging of a polygon of minimal area that contains a prespecified fraction of the high-precision position measurements of each tagged cluster. A novel algorithm for calculation of a polygon is proposed for this purpose. Whenever AECID positioning is requested, the method first looks up the detected neighbor cells and the auxiliary connection information and performs required auxiliary measurements. The polygon corresponding to the so-obtained tag is then retrieved and sent in response to the positioning request. The automatic self-learning algorithm provides location results in terms of minimal areas with a guaranteed confidence, adapted against live measurements. The AECID method can, therefore, also be viewed as a robust fingerprinting algorithm. The application to fingerprinting is illustrated by an example where quantized path-loss measurements from six base stations are combined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Enhanced Cell-ID Fingerprinting Localization by Clustering of Precise Position Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900400","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305545.pdf","startPage":"3199","endPage":"3209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Enhanced Cell-ID Fingerprinting Localization by Clustering of Precise Position Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305545/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Enhanced Cell-ID Fingerprinting Localization by Clustering of Precise Position Measurements","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-wigren-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08408S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4305552,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Yin","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305473/4305552/4305552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guodong Yin was born in Shandong, China, in 1976.

The proposed mobile communication system is much more flexible and efficient in providing asymmetric data service and managing intercell interference by exploiting the advantages of both time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) schemes. The HDD scheme has a pair of frequency bands such as the FDD, performing a TDD operation using one of the bands in such a manner that allows for simultaneous FDD and TDD operations. Considering the properties of the HDD system architecture, frequency hopping orthogonal frequency division multiple (OFDM) access is adopted in one band for the TDD operation and code division multiple access (CDMA) in the other band for the FDD uplink operation. The important advantage of the HDD scheme is the robustness against cross time slot interference that is inherent to the TDD system, which is caused by the asynchronous downlink/uplink switching boundaries among all neighbor cells. From the simulation results, the proposed system can achieve approximately 7% and 30% improvement with regard to the downlink and uplink throughput, respectively, as compared to the conventional TDD system under cell-independent downlink/uplink traffic asymmetries. It demonstrates that the HDD scheme is a viable solution for future communication systems that are projected to have a cell-independent asymmetric-traffic-supported hierarchical cell structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305553.pdf","startPage":"3040","endPage":"3059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Division Duplex System for Next-Generation Cellular Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Downlink","Mobile communication","Interference","Multiaccess communication","OFDM","Robustness","Throughput","Traffic control","Communication system traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","code division multiple access","frequency hop communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid division duplex system","next-generation cellular services","fourth-generation mobile communication systems","asymmetric data service","intercell interference","time division duplex","frequency division duplex","HDD system architecture","frequency hopping orthogonal frequency division multiple access","TDD operation","code division multiple access","FDD uplink operation","cross time slot interference","asynchronous downlink/uplink switching boundaries","cell-independent downlink/uplink traffic asymmetries","OFDM","CDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code division multiple access (CDMA)","frequency division duplex (FDD)","frequency hopping orthogonal frequency division multiple access (FH-OFDMA)","hybrid division duplex (HDD)","time division duplex (TDD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Division Duplex System for Next-Generation Cellular Services","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305553/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624699","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Division Duplex System for Next-Generation Cellular Services","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-yun-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108861S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4305554,"authors":[{"name":"Dongmei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4305470/4305554/4305554-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongmei Zhao (M'02) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in June 2002.","Since July 2002, she has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, where she is currently an Assistant Professor.

Two approaches are proposed to achieve fair throughput among the cochannel BSSs: 1) dynamic network allocation vectors (DNAVs), which dynamically adjust the cochannel interference by temporarily stopping transmissions in some BSSs using network allocation vectors (NAVs), and 2) forced handoffs (FHO), which force mobile stations to hand off between neighboring BSSs. An optimization problem is formulated as well as a distributed scheme is proposed for each of the approaches for achieving the required throughput fairness while keeping high transmission throughput in the BSSs. Our results show that 1) the DNAV scheme can always achieve the required throughput fairness; 2) the FHO scheme can achieve the required throughput fairness, provided that there is a sufficient overlapping coverage area between BSSs; and 3) the throughput performance of the proposed distributed schemes is very close to the corresponding optimized one.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4305470/04305554.pdf","startPage":"3210","endPage":"3219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.900519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.900519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Fairness in Infrastructure-Based IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Mesh networks","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Frequency","Collision avoidance","Interchannel interference","Wireless mesh networks","Local area networks","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","mobile radio","optimisation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput fairness","infrastructure based IEEE 802.11","wireless mesh networks","basic service sets","inter BSS interference","frequency channels","dynamic network allocation vectors","cochannel interference","mobile stations","optimization problem","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fairness","IEEE 802.11","medium access control (MAC)","throughput","wireless mesh network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Fairness in Infrastructure-Based IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4305554/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624700","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Fairness in Infrastructure-Based IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt05-zhao-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082249S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4305470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4305470","articleId":"4305554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4305588,"authors":[{"name":"Pere J.

Companion models for the Yee cells and circuit components have been derived, permitting the use of MNA analysis to perform FDTD/transient circuit simulation using the Laguerre method. Companion models help simplify the matrix setup and reduce the matrix dimension that needs to be solved without employing long cumbersome equations. FDTD simulation using Laguerre polynomials is unconditionally stable and has shown to be much faster than conventional FDTD scheme. Prior work on transient electromagnetic simulation using Laguerre polynomials has a drawback of being able to simulate only for a certain time-duration. A memory/time efficient solution has been proposed by which simulation can be done for all time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/4305579/4305580/04305731.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2007.151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2007.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4305731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast FDTD Simulation Using Laguerre Polynomials in MNA Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Polynomials","Circuit simulation","Transient analysis","Electromagnetic transients","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Electromagnetic interference","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis","polynomials","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD","Laguerre polynomials","MNA Framework","circuit simulation","Yee cells","circuit components","transient circuit simulation","matrix dimension","transient electromagnetic simulation","modified nodal analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast FDTD Simulation Using Laguerre Polynomials in MNA Framework","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9834117","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast FDTD Simulation Using Laguerre Polynomials in MNA Framework","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WEPM11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064805S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4305579","isNumber":"4305580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4305579","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4305580","articleId":"4305731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4305733,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Topa","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Topa","id":"37266336700"},{"name":"Andrzej Karwowski","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Karwowski","id":"37266338600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1349-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1350-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-110X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1118"}],"articleNumber":"4305733","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Sampling methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Finite difference methods","Computational efficiency","Differential equations","Magnetic fields","Electromagnetic radiation","Integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","interpolation","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MoM-FDTD hybrid method","Huygens surfaces","magnetic field components","related equivalence-principle sources","spatial interpolation","adaptive sampling"]}],"abstract":"MoM-FDTD hybrid approach requires the information to be exchanged forth and back between the MoM-regions and the FDTD-regions coupled through the Huygens' surfaces.

Now, there are many papers which deal with noise characters of op amps. Most of them are focused on the input signal noises which flow into circuits while power/ground noise is not taken into account. The power/ground noise, however, is critical to the op amp performance as an operating speed increases and demand of mixed-mode system becomes stronger. This paper mechanism of power/ground noises flowing into the op amp and effects of the noises on the op amp as chip-package PDN co-modeling and circuit modeling are proposed.

These materials allow a wide range of conductivities that can satisfy any particular design. A design with an outer metallic layer and an inner layer of conductive dielectric can obtain advantages from both materials. In this paper the damping of resonances in enclosures with an aperture through conductive dielectrics is optimized by means of Genetic Algorithms with the aid of a three dimensional simulation tool. Genetic Algorithms are a general purpose optimization technique widely used in the last years for electromagnetic design. The relationship between obtained solutions and skin depth parameter is shown in order to help in design procedures.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2007.215","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2007.215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4305580","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/4305579/4305580/04305795.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonance suppression in enclosures with a metallic-lossy dielectric layer by means of genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4305795/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resonance suppression in enclosures with a metallic-lossy dielectric layer by means of genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4305795/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9830161","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonance suppression in enclosures with a metallic-lossy dielectric layer by means of genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"THAM36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036646S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4305579","isNumber":"4305580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4305579","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4305580","articleId":"4305795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4306302,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lackman","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lackman"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0360-8581"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4178"}],"articleNumber":"4306302","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Technology Management Council","url":"http://www.ieee.org/tmc"}],"abstract":"This publication contains reprint articles for which IEEE does not hold copyright.

The purpose of this paper is to present intrabuilding signal attenuation measurements taken from five different buildings. The measurements cover the range 20-240 kHz and include transmissions across power phases. The measurements complement earlier measurements by others of power-line impedance and noise. Impedance, attenuation, and noise characterize any communication channel and are needed for design of communication signaling formats, error-control codes, and communication protocols. Except over short distances, attenuation normally exceeds 20 dB, and can be much higher. The attenuation which occurs when the transmitter and receiver use different power-line phases is not always larger than when both are on the same phase. Narrow-band frequency-selective fades can occur and change as network loading changes, and can also exhibit periodic time dependence. Loading, which is time varying, greatly affects signal attenuation between network nodes. The results clearly indicate that power-line signal attenuation is highly variable and unpredictable, is variable with communication signal frequency, and is not easily modeled mathematically. The implications of our results for intrabuilding communications on power-distribution circuits are discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1986.4307293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307283","startPage":"220","endPage":"230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4307283/04307293.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attenuation of Communication Signals on Residential and Commercial Intrabuilding Power-Distribution Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Attenuation of Communication Signals on Residential and Commercial Intrabuilding Power-Distribution Circuits","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attenuation of Communication Signals on Residential and Commercial Intrabuilding Power-Distribution Circuits","sourcePdf":"TEMC-v28-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058223S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4307283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"74","articleId":"4307293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4307295,"authors":[{"name":"Malek G.

The first analytical technique is not general, and the limits of applicability of the results are discussed. In the second solution, which is general, expressions are derived for the total electric and magnetic fields on both sides of and within the shield. The resulting expression for shielding effectiveness is not solved because of its complexity. The results of the third theory are adapted to the problem. The shielding effectiveness expression S = R + A + B is computer evaluated for the six shields considered (1/16-inch and 1/8-inch thick aluminum, copper, and steel).

Moreover, it minimizes distance and is nonexpansive, and therefore shares two of the more important properties of ordinary linear orthogonal projections onto closed linear manifolds. In this paper, we exploit the properties of these operators to develop several iterative algorithms for image restoration from partial data which permit any number of nonlinear constraints of a certain type to be subsumed automatically. Their common conceptual basis is as follows. Every known property of an original image f is envisaged as restricting it to lie in a well-defined closed convex set. Thus, m such properties place f in the intersection E0 = Ei of the corresponding closed convex sets E1,E2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Em. Given only the projection operators Pi onto the individual Ei's, i = 1 \u2192 m, we restore f by recursive means. Clearly, in this approach, the realization of the Pi's in a Hilbert space setting is one of the major synthesis problems. Section I describes the geometrical significance of the three main theorems in considerable detail, and most of the underlying ideas are illustrated with the aid of simple diagrams. Section II presents rules for the numerical implementation of 11 specific projection operators which are found to occur frequently in many signal-processing applications, and the Appendix contains proofs of all the major results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Restoration by the Method of Convex Projections: Part 1\u07deTheory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1982.4307555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307552/04307555.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1982.4307555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Image Restoration by the Method of Convex Projections: Part 1\u07deTheory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","pubMedId":"18238261","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Restoration by the Method of Convex Projections: Part 1\u07deTheory","sourcePdf":"TMI-v1-n2-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031073S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"4307552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"777","articleId":"4307555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4307556,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We give a more accurate general mathematical model for ET where an unknown emission density \u03bb = \u03bb(x, y, z) generates, and is to be reconstructed from, the number of counts n*(d) in each of D detector units d. Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate \u03bb of \u03bb which maximizes the probability p(n*|\u03bb) of observing the actual detector count data n* over all possible densities \u03bb. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means \u03bb(b), b = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter. Suppose each emission in box b is detected in detector unit d with probability p(b, d), d = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, D with p(b, d) a one-step transition matrix, assumed known.

For each \u03bb, the observed data n* has probability or likelihood p(n*|\u03bb).

In the rotary PCT, detector units are mounted unequally spaced on a ring so as to provide fine and uniform linear sampling during a 360\u00b0 rotation of the ring around its center. This principle was applied to a system named POSITOLOGICA I, but it has unidetector units [one detector-one photomultiplier tube (PMT)]. The quad-detector unit consists of four BGO crystals, two PMT's, and a circuit positioning the address of the crystal by which a gamma ray is detected.

An algorithm is described, based on linear interpolation between pixels, which provides superior accuracy without unnecessary loss of resolution.

To preserve image quality, the interpolating function used for the resampling should be an ideal low-pass filter. To determine which limited extent convolving functions would provide the best interpolation, five functions were compared: A) nearest neighbor, B) linear, C) cubic B-spline, D) high-resolution cubic spline with edge enhancement (a = -1), and E) high-resolution cubic spline (a = -0.5). The functions which extend over four picture elements (C, D, E) were shown to have a better frequency response than those which extend over one (A) or two (B) pixels. The nearest neighbor function shifted the image up to one-half a pixel. Linear and cubic B-spline interpolation tended to smooth the image. The best response was obtained with the high-resolution cubic spline functions. The location of the resampled points with respect to the initial coordinate system has a dramatic effect on the response of the sampled interpolating function-the data are exactly reproduced when the points are aligned, and the response has the most smoothing when the resampled points are equidistant from the original coordinate points. Thus, at the expense of some increase in computing time, image quality can be improved by resampled using the high-resolution cubic spline function as compared to the nearest neighbor, linear, or cubic B-spline functions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307600/04307610.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Interpolating Methods for Image Resampling","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1983.4307610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1983.4307610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Interpolating Methods for Image Resampling","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"March 1983","pubMedId":"18234586","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Interpolating Methods for Image Resampling","sourcePdf":"TMI-v2-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031834S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"4307600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"474","articleId":"4307610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4307636,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Caprihan","affiliation":["Clinical Research Division, Lovelace Medical Foundation, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Caprihan","id":"37298892400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4307636","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":51},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Radio frequency","Pulse modulation","Computer simulation","Magnetization","Image resolution","Gaussian processes","Magnetic fields","Equations"]}],"abstract":"If NMR imaging uses selective excitation, then it has to do it correctly as it affects the image resolution.

Three images are picked up by a digitizing TV camera: the vertical image (90\u00b0), a glancing image (180\u00b0), and one at 45\u00b0, obtained by using two front-silvered mirrors held next to the nevus in a \"nevoscope.\" The digitized images are used in a computed tomography algorithm to calculate approximate vertical cross sections of the nevus. The algorithm is one we recently developed to permit reconstruction from a very few projections. Our method is completely noninvasive. It may be used to check all the nevi on a patient.

To restore the missing information we use the method of projections onto convex sets (POCS). POCS is a recursive image restoration technique that finds a solution consistent with the measured data and a priori known constraints in both the space and Fourier domain. Because DFM reconstruction is a frequency-domain technique it is ideally matched to POCS restoration when, for one reason or another, we are forced to generate an image from a less than complete set of view data. We design and apply an algorithm (PRDF) which interpolates/extrapolates the missing Fourier domain information by POCS and reconstructs an image by DFM. A simulated human thorax cross section is restored and reconstructed. The restorations using POCS are compared with the Gerchberg-Papoulis extrapolation method and shown to be superior. Applications of PRDF to other types of medical imaging modalities are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1984.4307661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307651/04307661.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1984.4307661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1984","displayDocTitle":"Tomographic Image Reconstruction from Incomplete View Data by Convex Projections and Direct Fourier Inversion","volume":"3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 1984","pubMedId":"18234616","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307661/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomographic Image Reconstruction from Incomplete View Data by Convex Projections and Direct Fourier Inversion","sourcePdf":"TMI-v3-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031131S","chronDate":"June  1984","isNumber":"4307651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"100","articleId":"4307661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":4307675,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A new algorithm has been designed for use with three-dimensional biological/ medical images which attempts to overcome these limitations. This is accomplished by eliminating less important capabilities and optimizing the essential ones of speed and realistic shading. The algorithm has been successfully employed in planning reconstructive bone surgery, in assessment of both congenital and acquired heart disease, and in studies of normal and pathological lung physiology.

This proposed spiral-scan echo planar imaging (SEPI) technique employs two linearly increasing sinusoidal gradient fields, which results in a spiral trajectory in the spatial frequency domain (k-domain) that covers the entire frequency domain uniformly. The advantages of the method are: 1) circularly symmetric T2 weighting, resulting in a circularly symmetric point spread function in the image domain; 2) elimination of discontinuities in gradient waveforms which in turn will reduce initial transient as well as steady-state distortions; and 3) effective rapid spiral-scan from dc to high frequency in a continuous fashion, which ensures multiple pulsing with interlacing for further resolution improvement without T2 decay image degradation. Some preliminary experimental results will be presented and further possible improvements suggested.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nuclear magnetic resonance","Spirals","Frequency domain analysis","Magnetic resonance imaging","Optical imaging","Image resolution","Sampling methods","Image reconstruction","High-resolution imaging","Student members"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMI.1986.4307732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307728/04307732.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1986.4307732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Spiral-Scan Echo Planar NMR Imaging-I","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Spiral-Scan Echo Planar NMR Imaging-I","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307732/","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1986","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18243976","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Spiral-Scan Echo Planar NMR Imaging-I","sourcePdf":"TMI-v5-n1-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027508S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4307728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"378","articleId":"4307732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4307738,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Heinz Hohne","firstName":"Karl Heinz","lastName":"Hohne","id":"37378529100"},{"name":"Ralph Bernstein","affiliation":["IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Bernstein","id":"37295630900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4307738","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bones","Layout","Biological tissues","Computed tomography","Interpolation","Head","Dynamic range","Surgery","Quantization","Surface structures"]}],"abstract":"For the 3D-reconstruction of organ surfaces from tomograms, a shading method based on the partial volume effect is presented.

Several scanners are being built with fine sampling in the axial as well as transverse directions, leading to the possibility of the true volume imaging. The number of possible coincidence pairs in these scanners is quite large. The usual methods of image reconstruction cannot handle these data without making approximations. It is computationally most efficient to reduce the size of this large, sparsely populated array by back-projecting the coincidence data prior to reconstruction. While analytic reconstruction techniques exist for back-projected data, an iterative algorithm may be necessary for those cases where the point spread function is spatially variant. A modification of the maximum likelihood algorithm is proposed to reconstruct these back-projected data. The method, the iterative image space reconstruction algorithm (ISRA), is able to reconstruct data from a scanner with a spatially variant point spread function in less time than other proposed algorithms. Results are presented for single-slice data, simulated and actual, from the PENN-PET scanner.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1986.4307748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307744/04307748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1986.4307748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307744","startPage":"61","endPage":"66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Image Space Reconstruction Algorthm Suitable for Volume ECT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Image Space Reconstruction Algorthm Suitable for Volume ECT","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1986","pubMedId":"18243988","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Image Space Reconstruction Algorthm Suitable for Volume ECT","sourcePdf":"TMI-v5-n2-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049059S","chronDate":"June  1986","isNumber":"4307744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"185","articleId":"4307748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4307752,"authors":[{"name":"David Isaacson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Isaacson","id":"37268660900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4307752","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":304,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":903},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Conductivity measurement","Surface morphology","Inverse problems","Voltage","Image reconstruction","Surface reconstruction","Current density","Surface impedance"]}],"abstract":"We give criteria for the distinguishability of two different conductivity distributions inside a body by electric current computed tomography (ECCT) systems with a specified precision.

The application of the FFT leads to artifacts and resolution loss in the image associated with the effective window on the experimentally-truncated phase encoded MR data. The transient error modeling method treats the MR data as a subset of the transient response of an infinite impulse filter (H(z) = B(z)IA(z)). Thus, the data are approximated by a deterministic autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. The algorithm for calculating the filter coefficients is described. It is demonstrated that using the filter coefficients to reconstruct the image removes the truncation artifacts and improves the resolution. However, determining the autoregressive (AR) portion of the ARMA filter by algorithms that minimize the forward and backward prediction errors (e.g., Burg) leads to significant image degradation. The moving average (MA) portion is determined by a computationally efficient method of solving a finite difference equation with initial values. Special features of the MR data are incorporated into the transient error model. The sensitivity to noise and the choice of the best model order are discussed. MR images formed using versions of the transient error reconstruction (TERE) method and the conventional FFT algorithm are compared using data from a phantom and a human subject. Finally, the computational requirements of the algorithm are addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1986.4307762","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307757/04307762.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1986.4307762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Autoregressive Moving Average Parametric Modeling in Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parametric statistics","Magnetic resonance","Image reconstruction","Autoregressive processes","Filters","Image resolution","Fast Fourier transforms","Transient response","Magnetic separation","Degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Application of Autoregressive Moving Average Parametric Modeling in Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","pubMedId":"18243999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Autoregressive Moving Average Parametric Modeling in Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"TMI-v5-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049137S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4307757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"67","articleId":"4307762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4307764,"authors":[{"name":"Torbjorn Lundahl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Torbjorn","lastName":"Lundahl","id":"37703789800"},{"name":"William J.

Use of this methodology normally involves measurement of a parameter H, which is directly related to fractal dimension. In this work the basic theory of fractional Brownian motion is extended to the discrete case. It is shown that the power spectral density of such a discrete process is only approximately proportional to |f|a instead of in direct proportion as in the continuous case. An asymptotic Cramer-Rao bound is derived for the variance of an estimate of H. Subsequently, a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is developed to estimate H. It is shown that the variance of this estimator nearly achieves the minimum bound. A generation algorithm for discrete fractional motion is presented and used to demonstrate the capabilities of the MLE when the discrete fractional Brownian process is contaminated with additive Gaussian noise. The results show that even at signal-to-noise ratios of 30 dB, significant errors in estimation of H can result when noise is present. The MLE is then applied to X-ray images of the human calcaneus to demonstrate how the line-to-line formulation can be applied to the two-dimensional case. These results indicate that it has strong potential for quantifying texture.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1986.4307764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307757/04307764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1986.4307764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307757","startPage":"152","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Brownian Motion: A Maximum Likelihood Estimator and Its Application to Image Texture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Brownian Motion: A Maximum Likelihood Estimator and Its Application to Image Texture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","pubMedId":"18244001","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Brownian Motion: A Maximum Likelihood Estimator and Its Application to Image Texture","sourcePdf":"TMI-v5-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033508S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4307757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"265","articleId":"4307764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4307775,"authors":[{"name":"Johann Radon","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Radon","id":"37703811100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4307775","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":304,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1932},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integral equations","Mathematics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307775","doi":"10.1109/TMI.1986.4307775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","abstract":"When one integrates a function of two variables x,y - a point function f(P) in the plane - subject to suitable regularity conditions along an arbitrary straight line g then one obtains in the integral values F(g), a line function. In Part A of the present paper the problem which is solved is the inversion of this linear functional transformation, that is the following questions are answered: can every line function satisfying suitable regularity conditions be regarded as constructed in this way? If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces. The treatment of these problems, themselves of interest, gains enhanced importance through the numerous relationships that exist between this topic and the theory of logarithmic and Newtonian potentials. These are mentioned at appropriate places in the text.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.1986.4307775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307771","startPage":"170","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4307771/04307775.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the determination of functions from their integral values along certain manifolds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the determination of functions from their integral values along certain manifolds","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","pubMedId":"18244009","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the determination of functions from their integral values along certain manifolds","sourcePdf":"TMI-v5-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014559S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4307771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"304","articleId":"4307775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4307796,"authors":[{"name":"Linda Kaufman","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Kaufman","id":"37355278000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4307796","dbTime":"95 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":221,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":455},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Positron emission tomography","Reconstruction algorithms","Detectors","Maximum likelihood detection","Data structures","Geometry","Numerical analysis","Blood flow","Biochemistry"]}],"abstract":"Since the publication of Shepp and Vadi's [ 14] maximum likelihood reconstruction algorithm for emission tomography (ET), many medical research centers engaged in ET have made an effort to change their reconstruction algorithms to this new approach.

The approach is equivalent to a penalized maximum likelihood estimation with a special choice of the penalty function. The expectation maximization method is applied to find the a posteriori probability maximizer. A simple iterative formula is derived for a penalty function that is a weighted sum of the squared deviations of image vector components from their a priori mean values. The method is demonstrated to be superior to pure likelihood maximization, in that the penalty function prevents the occurrence of irregular high amplitude patterns in the image with a large number of iterations (the so-called \"checkerboard effect\" or \"noise artifact\").","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","volume":"6","issue":"3","pubMedId":"18244020","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Maximum a Posteriori Probability Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Image Reconstruction in Emission Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum a Posteriori Probability Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Image Reconstruction in Emission Tomography","sourcePdf":"TMI-v6-n3-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023043S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"4307823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"299","articleId":"4307826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4307827,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The control laws for every power stage are derived, and two open-loop and two closed-loop circuits are shown and analized in detail. The interaction of the major voltage control loop and the frequency control circuitry is also investigated for buck converters. It is shown that, if the average inductor current is programmed, the two mechanisms are independent, while if the peak inductor current is programmed, they are not. The frequency control circuitry in the latter case decreases the phase margin of the voltage control loop and can lead to instability. Simple circuits are developed to implement the superior average inductor-current programming. As a consequence of being controlled via the current hysteresis, the operating frequency cannot be stabilized in the light mode, where VO/RL < IH/2. In the special case, where the frequency of the converter is stabilized by a phase-locked loop, a method and circuit are shown to solve this problem and achieve constant frequency operation at any load.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.1987.4307865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4307859/04307865.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.1987.4307865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing the Frequency of Hysteretic Current-Mode DC/DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing the Frequency of Hysteretic Current-Mode DC/DC Converters","volume":"PE-2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing the Frequency of Hysteretic Current-Mode DC/DC Converters","sourcePdf":"TPEL-v2-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031035S","chronDate":"Oct.  1987","isNumber":"4307859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"27","articleId":"4307865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4307872,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Stoisiek","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Stoisiek","id":"37313899400"},{"name":"Dietmar Theis","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Theis","id":"37418436700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"4307872","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307872","abstract":"MOS-GTO's (GTO thyristors which are turned off by the action of a MOS-gate) represent a new generation of controllable thyristors offering considerable advantages in turn-off behavior as compared to conventional GTO's.

In this GTO converter, the energy stored in leakage inductances of the transformer is handled by voltage clipper circuit.

A fault location algorithm that derives from travelling wave principles can cope with high frequency transients since these basically depend on travelling wave phenomena. The development of such an algorithm is the objective of this paper. Using the telegraph equations as a line model, voltage and current samples taken at one end of a line within the first 5 ms of fault inception are used to generate instantaneous voltage and current profiles for the rest of the transmission line. The voltage and current estimation is based on the solution of the equations of the line model by the method of characteristics. Criteria functions involving any of the square of the voltage, the square of the current, or the product of the two are applied for determination of the fault position. Fault position is given by the peak variation in tangent to the above basic functions. The algorithm finds application in fault location on two and three-terminal networks at both transmission and distribution levels.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1986.4307961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4307924/04307961.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1986.4307961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4307924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Travelling Wave-Based Fault Locator for Two- and Three-Terminal Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4307961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4307961/","displayDocTitle":"A Travelling Wave-Based Fault Locator for Two- and Three-Terminal Networks","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Travelling Wave-Based Fault Locator for Two- and Three-Terminal Networks","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v1-n2-37.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031658S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"4307924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4307961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4307994,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Frequently, losses due to harmonic currents are assumed to vary with the square of frequency. The purpose of this paper is to compare winding loss calculations from a finite element method with measured losses in single phase distribution transformers and to test the principle of superposition of harmonic losses due to nonsinusoidal currents. The results confirm both the finite element method and the principle of superposition. Furthermore, it is shown that, due primarily to inaccuracy in measuring 60 Hz eddy current losses, application of the commonly accepted frequency squared rule can yield overly pessimistic loss predictions for typical power system harmonic frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308084","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4308062/04308084.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"140","endPage":"146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution Transformer Winding Losses Due to Nonsinusoidal Currents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Distribution Transformer Winding Losses Due to Nonsinusoidal Currents","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308084/","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution Transformer Winding Losses Due to Nonsinusoidal Currents","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v2-n1-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049018S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4308062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4308084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4308085,"authors":[{"name":"K.

While this method provided improved detection of such faults, this high frequency signal often would not propagate past capacitor banks. In the present paper, we describe a technique for the identification of arcing high impedance faults using burst noise signals at frequencies near the power system fundamental and low order harmonics. Arcing generates non-synchronous burst noise signals which approximate white noise, providing a signal which can be differentiated from synchronous power system signals in the frequency bands of interest. The primary advantage of monitoring frequencies near the fundamental is that this arcing fault signal at low frequencies will exhibit little attenuation from capacitor banks or other sources. This paper provides preliminary results that arcing faults can be detected effectively using frequency components below 60 Hz or between low order harmonics of 60 Hz. The technique is demonstrated through analysis of analog signals recorded during numerouis staged utility downed conductor tests.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4308103/04308114.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Distribution High Impedance Faults Using Burst Noise Signals near 60 HZ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308114/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Distribution High Impedance Faults Using Burst Noise Signals near 60 HZ","volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Distribution High Impedance Faults Using Burst Noise Signals near 60 HZ","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v2-n2-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023639S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"4308103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"56","articleId":"4308114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4308132,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The influence of inorganic filler, type, concentration and dispersion and the magnitude of the electric stress on the tracking and erosion properties of the materials are reported under high salinity conditions. The presence of filler in EPR material is shown to enhance leakage current. Studies of filler dispersion by an energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) show non-uniformity in filler concentration where erosion or tracking is initiated. The mechanisms by which the filler operates to impart improved resistance to tracking or erosion is discussed through measurements of surface temperature, released gases, weight loss and leakage current.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4308103/04308132.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Polymeric Insulating Materials in Salt-Fog","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polymers","Plastic insulation","Conducting materials","Insulation life","Rubber","Paramagnetic resonance","Leakage current","Surface resistance","Temperature measurement","Stress"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Polymeric Insulating Materials in Salt-Fog","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Polymeric Insulating Materials in Salt-Fog","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v2-n2-29.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028446S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"4308103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"46","articleId":"4308132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4308135,"authors":[{"name":"Turan Gonen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Turan","lastName":"Gonen","id":"37443008300"},{"name":"Ignacio J.

Special features of the programs include: automatic grid generation routine, user friendly input and output structures, sensitivity analysis, combined heat/moisture analysis, and a new, exact method of modeling the heat flux distribution in the region between the cables and the retaining duct in the underground power transmission system. The analysis reveals that the heat flux on the inside surface of the retaining duct is not uniform, as generally assumed in cable ampacity calculations. In fact, the heat flux is maximum at the top where the convection induced flux is much stronger than at the bottom or elsewhere around the duct. Laboratory experimental verification of the heat flux model is presented. A full scale test of a 12 cable system in a concrete duct bank is described and the temperatures measured over a 42-day period are compared with those obtained using the new computer program.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4308204/04308208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308204","startPage":"969","endPage":"975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Approach to Ampacity Evaluation of Cables in Ducts Using Finite Elemet Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Approach to Ampacity Evaluation of Cables in Ducts Using Finite Elemet Technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approach to Ampacity Evaluation of Cables in Ducts Using Finite Elemet Technique","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v2-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031923S","chronDate":"Oct.  1987","isNumber":"4308204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"31","articleId":"4308208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4308223,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The methodology can accommodate any configuration of a grounding system comprising rectilinear conductors. The approach is based on transmission line concepts. Finite element analysis is employed to model the constituent parts of a grounding system. The grounding system is segmented into short lengths of earth embedded electrodes which are characterized as lossy transmission lines with distributed inductance, capacitance, series resistahce, resistance to earth, and mutual coupling to any other finite element of earth conductors. The parameters of the short earth embedded electrodes are computed by solution of Maxwell's equations and assuming quasi-static conditions. The paper presents a validation procedure which is based on comparison of analysis results to test results obtained at BPA. The model is applicable for transient phenomena comprising a wide range of frequencies. Results are presented which illustrate the properties of grounding systems to low as well as high frequency transients.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4308204/04308223.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.1987.4308223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Dependent Characteristics of Grounding Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency dependence","Grounding","Power system modeling","Conductors","Power transmission lines","Finite element methods","Electrodes","Power system transients","Computational modeling","Transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Dependent Characteristics of Grounding Systems","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Dependent Characteristics of Grounding Systems","sourcePdf":"TPWRD-v2-n4-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036743S","chronDate":"Oct.  1987","isNumber":"4308204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"70","articleId":"4308223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4308237,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The hypersurface is usually described by a number of experimental (vector) points and simple functions of their coordinates. The approach taken in this paper to approximating the decision hypersurface, and hence the input-output relationship of a complex system, is to fit a high-degree multinomial to the input properties using a multilayered perceptronlike network structure. Thresholds are employed at each layer in the network to identify those polynomials which best fit into the desired hypersurface. Only the best combinations of the input properties are allowed to pass to succeeding layers, where more complex combinations are formed. Each element in each layer in the network implements a nonlinear function of two inputs. The coefficients of each element are determined by a regression technique which enables each element to approximate the true outputs with minimum mean-square error. The experimental data base is divided into a training and testing set. The training set is used to obtain the element coefficients, and the testing set is used to determine the utility of a given element in the network and to control overfitting of the experimental data. This latter feature is termed \"decision regularization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1971","publicationDate":"Oct. 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"SMC-1","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Theory of Complex Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Theory of Complex Systems","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v1-n4-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023568S","chronDate":"Oct.  1971","isNumber":"4308307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"900","articleId":"4308320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4308330,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew P.

Wih this formulation it should be possible in principle to compute the Lagrangian dynamics in real time. The computational complexities of this and other dynamics formulations including rect Newton-Euler formulations and tabular formulations are compared. It Is concluded that recursive formultions based either on the Lagrangian or Newton-Euler dynamics offer the best method of dynamns calculation.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1980.4308393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308385/04308393.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1980.4308393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recursive Lagrangian Formulation of Maniputator Dynamics and a Comparative Study of Dynamics Formulation Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308393/","displayDocTitle":"A Recursive Lagrangian Formulation of Maniputator Dynamics and a Comparative Study of Dynamics Formulation Complexity","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recursive Lagrangian Formulation of Maniputator Dynamics and a Comparative Study of Dynamics Formulation Complexity","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v10-n11-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061111S","chronDate":"Nov.  1980","isNumber":"4308385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"606","articleId":"4308393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4308425,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4308425","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recursive estimation","Filters","Pulse modulation","Gaussian noise","Distortion measurement","Filtering","Modulation coding","Stability","Signal to noise ratio","Noise reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308425","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1980.4308425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308404/04308425.pdf","startPage":"929","endPage":"936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1980.4308425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Some Two-Dimensional Recursive Point-to-Point Estimators Based on a DPCM Image Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Some Two-Dimensional Recursive Point-to-Point Estimators Based on a DPCM Image Model","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Some Two-Dimensional Recursive Point-to-Point Estimators Based on a DPCM Image Model","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v10-n12-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085739S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"4308404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4308425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4308494,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In the former, nodes assist each other by sharing the computational load for the execution of subtasks of the overall problem. In the latter, nodes assist each other by sharing partial results which are based on somewhat different perspectives on the overall problem. Different perspectives arise because the nodes use different knowledge sources (KS's) (e.g., syntax versus acoustics in the case of a speech-understanding system) or different data (e.g., data that is sensed at different locations in the case of a distributed sensing system). Particular attention is given to control and to internode communication for the two forms of cooperation. For each, the basic methodology is presented and systems in which it has been used are described. The two forms are then compared and the types of applications for which they are suitable are considered.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308579","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308570/04308579.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"61","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frameworks for Cooperation in Distributed Problem Solving","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Frameworks for Cooperation in Distributed Problem Solving","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308579/","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frameworks for Cooperation in Distributed Problem Solving","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v11-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04108S","chronDate":"Jan.  1981","isNumber":"4308570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"254","articleId":"4308579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4308589,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Lozano-Perez","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Lozano-Perez","id":"38273814000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4308589","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":309,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Path planning","Computer languages","Assembly systems","Artificial intelligence","Kinematics","Motion detection","Collision avoidance"]}],"abstract":"The class of problems that involve finding where to place or how to move a solid object in the presence of obstacles is discussed.

For example, planning transfer movements requires the ability to plan paths for the manipulator that avoid collisions with objects in the workspace and the ability to choose safe grasp points on objects. The approach to these problems described here is based on a method of computing an explicit representation of the manipulator configurations that would bring about a collision.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308586/04308589.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Planning of Manipulator Transfer Movements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308589/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Planning of Manipulator Transfer Movements","volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Planning of Manipulator Transfer Movements","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v11-n10-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041456S","chronDate":"Oct.  1981","isNumber":"4308586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"309","articleId":"4308589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4308619,"authors":[{"name":"Peter J.

The goal of segmentation is to partition the image into regions with more or less homogeneous properties; but the processes which estimate these properties should be confined within individual regions. A cooperative, iterative approach to segmentation and property estimation is defined; the results of each process at a given iteration are used to adjust the other process at the next iteration. A linked pyramid structure provides a framework for this process iteration.

Performance tests of the heuristic methods and several applications are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308632/04308636.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods for Visual Understanding of Hierarchical System Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Methods for Visual Understanding of Hierarchical System Structures","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for Visual Understanding of Hierarchical System Structures","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v11-n2-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026924S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"4308632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"731","articleId":"4308636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4308652,"authors":[{"name":"Lewis G.

Our evaluation of this procedure on a data base of 81 targets, 34 for design and 47 for test, resulted in only two false negatives (missed targets) and no false detections. Our procedure consists of an intensity normalizer, a dc notch filter, an edge detector, a spoke filter, a gradient-guided segmenter, an extractor of the standard deviation of the gray level in each blob, an extractor of the fraction of intense edge elements along the boundary of each blob, and a three-nearest-neighbor classifier. Among these processes, the spoke filter and the gradient-guided segmenter are new. Both of them contribute strongly to the effectiveness of our procedure. The spoke filter is sensitive to a wide variety of shapes of blobs within a specified range of sizes. The gradient-guided segmenter exploits the noise immunity of the direction of the digital gradient to find a best threshold for segmenting each detected blob.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1981.4308652","startPage":"194","endPage":"201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308647/04308652.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Detection and Segmentation of Blobs in Infrared Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1981","displayDocTitle":"The Detection and Segmentation of Blobs in Infrared Images","publicationDate":"March 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308652/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Detection and Segmentation of Blobs in Infrared Images","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v11-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023873S","chronDate":"March  1981","isNumber":"4308647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"73","articleId":"4308652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4308653,"authors":[{"name":"Lena Linde","affiliation":["Swedish National Defence Research Institute, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Linde","id":"37722440200"},{"name":"Hans Marmolin","affiliation":["Swedish National Defence Research Institute, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Marmolin","id":"37705173300"},{"name":"Sten Nyberg","affiliation":["Swedish National Defence Research Institute, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sten","lastName":"Nyberg","id":"37087301756"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4308653","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visual effects","Sampling methods","Frequency","Image sampling","Layout","Multidimensional systems","Image reconstruction","Filtering","Image communication","Distortion measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308653","abstract":"The perceptual significance of sampling distortions due to band limitation and aliasing was investigated.

Compliant motion may be produced either by a passive mechanical compliance built in to the manipulator, or by an active compliance implemented in the control servo loop. The second method, called force control, is the subject of this paper. In particular a theory of force control based on formal models of the manipulator and the task geometry is presented. The ideal effector is used to model the manipulator, the ideal surface is used to model the task geometry, and the goal trajectory is used to model the desired behavior of the manipulator. Models are also defined for position control and force control, providing a precise semantics for compliant motion primitives in manipulation programming languages. The formalism serves as a simple interface between the manipulator and the programmer, isolating the programmer from the fundamental complexity of low-level manipulator control. A method of automatically synthesizing a restricted class of manipulator programs based on the formal models of task and goal trajectory is also provided by the formalism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","publicationDate":"June 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"11","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compliance and Force Control for Computer Controlled Manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compliance and Force Control for Computer Controlled Manipulators","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v11-n6-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039864S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"4308702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"727","articleId":"4308708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4308709,"authors":[{"name":"Gene H.

By using a computer with multiple central processing units (CPU's), parallel computations may be executed to achieve a minimum computing time so that a real-time control is possible. The parallel processing system utilizes one CPU for each link of the manipulator. Because of the dynamic coupling between adjacent links, precedence relations appear among the subtasks to be executed in CPU's. Under the series-parallel precedence constraints a method of \"variable\" branch-and-bound has been developed which determines an optimum ordered schedule for each of the CPU's. It consists of, alternatively, forward and backward search procedures with an aid of pushdown-stacks. In each forward search procedure, it seeks the currently feasible schedule with shorter computing time which updates the upper bound of the optimum schedule, while in each backward search procedure it discards those schedule-branches that will not provide improvements. A Fortran program has been written for a manipulator based on the Newton-Euler formulation of dynamic equations and is applied to the Stanford manipulator as an illustration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308790/04308805.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1982.4308805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1982.4308805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of Parallel Computation for a Computer-Controlled Mechanical Manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrent computing","Processor scheduling","Manipulator dynamics","Central Processing Unit","Microcomputers","Centralized control","Mechanical variables control","Parallel processing","Upper bound","Equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of Parallel Computation for a Computer-Controlled Mechanical Manipulator","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of Parallel Computation for a Computer-Controlled Mechanical Manipulator","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v12-n2-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041354S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4308790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4308805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4308806,"authors":[{"name":"Brian D.

The concept of support functions, which allows us to develop and interpret geometrically the generalized benders decomposition, is introduced. After a brief differentiability study of the related perturbation functions, a primal method is proposed, which can handle problems for which the Geoffrion's property P (or p') is not present. The property P states that the optimal solution of the associated Lagrangian function is independent of any feasible value of the complicating variables, and it is essential to build up efficiently the cuts that define the master problem. A large-scale problem the unit commitment of thermal plants with start-up costs with ten boolean variables, 240 continuous variables, and 528 constraints is solved. The computational experience included shows the great numerical efficiency of the decomposition technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4308937/04308943.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1986.4308943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1986.4308943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4308937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4308943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Programs with Complicating Variables: Theoretical Analysis and Numerical Experience","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Lagrangian functions","Costs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4308943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Programs with Complicating Variables: Theoretical Analysis and Numerical Experience","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Programs with Complicating Variables: Theoretical Analysis and Numerical Experience","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v16-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025698S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4308937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4308943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4308946,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus-Peter Adlassnig","firstName":"Klaus-Peter","lastName":"Adlassnig"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4308946","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":237,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":892},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"Fuzzy set theory has a number of properties that make it suitable for formalizing the uncertain information upon which medical diagnosis and treatment is usually based.

Micromodular transforms are used to embody the program's knowledge of the different objects it must recognize. Pyramid vision programs are described that, starting with the image, use transforms that assess key features to dynamically imply other feature-detecting and characterizing transforms and additional top-down model-driven processes to apply. Program performance is presented for four real-world images of buildings. The use of key features in pyramid vision programs and the related search and control issues are discussed. To expedite the detection of various key features, feature-adaptable windows are developed. In addition to image-driven bottom-up and model-driven top-down processing, lateral search is used and is shown to be helpful, efficient, and feasible. The results indicate that with the use of key features and the combination of a variety of powerful search patterns, the pyramidlike structure is effective and efficient for supporting parallel and hierarchical object recognition algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1987.4309036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1987.4309036","startPage":"250","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309021/04309036.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pyramid Vision Using Key Features to Integrate Image-Driven Bottom-Up and Model-Driven Top-Down Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","displayDocTitle":"Pyramid Vision Using Key Features to Integrate Image-Driven Bottom-Up and Model-Driven Top-Down Processes","publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309036/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramid Vision Using Key Features to Integrate Image-Driven Bottom-Up and Model-Driven Top-Down Processes","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v17-n2-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049541S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4309021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4309036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4309044,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An associative memory device, called \" Associatron,\" is proposed. The Associatron stores entities represented by bit patterns in a distributed manner and recalls the whole of any entity from a part of it. If the part is large, the recalled entity will be accurate; on the other hand, if the part is small, the recalled entity will be rather ambiguous. Any number of entities can be stored, but the accuracy of the recalled entity decreases as the number of entities increases. The Associatron is considered to be a simplified model of the neural network and can be constructed as a cellular structure, where each cell is connected to only its neighbor cells and all cells run in parallel. From its mechanisms some properties are derived that are expected to be utilized for human-like information processing. After these properties have been analyzed, an Associatron which deals with entities composed of less than 180 bits is simulated by a computer. Simple examples of its applications for concept formation and game playing are presented and the thinking process by the sequence of associations is described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"SMC-2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1972","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Associatron-A Model of Associative Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associatron-A Model of Associative Memory","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v2-n3-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02371S","chronDate":"July  1972","isNumber":"4309120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"259","articleId":"4309133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4309137,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis L.

This learning scheme is unlike \"learning with a teacher\" and unlike \"unsupervised learning.\" It involves \"bootstrap adaptation\" or \"learning with a critic.\" The critic rewards decisions which are members of successful chains of decisions and punishes other decisions. A general analytical model for learning with a critic is formulated and analyzed. The model represents bootstrap learning per se.

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.

Based on a subjective visibility function, which gives the relationship between the visibility of a unit noise and a measure of local spatial detail (spatial masking), two procedures are developed to adapt continuously the finite impulse response of a two-dimensional, noncausal, linear digital filter. At sharp transitions in the image intensity, the filter operator is strongly peaked to preserve the resolution, whereas in flat areas it is flat to effectively average out the random noise. The first procedure (S-filter) is computationally more efficient, but does not perform as well as the second method (SD-filter) which requires solution of a new optimization problem at every picture element. Results of several simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Extensions are pointed out to incorporate different adaptation procedures and psychovisual criteria other than the type of spatial masking used here.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and

These mosaics can also represent a variety of retinas in human and animal visual systems. We prove the existence of minimum-perimeter-polygon (MPP) representations of digitized blobs on arbitrary mosaics and the uniqueness of MPP's in acute mosaics. We introduce the concept of \"relative convexity,\" and show its relation to the MPP. We show that the MPP reflects the concavities of the digitized blob. We describe and prove the validity of simple tests for cellular convexity and cellular straightness. We present and prove the validity of an algorithm for computing the MPP of so-called \"normal complexes\" (a broad class of digitized blobs) on an acute mosaic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309562/04309569.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1976.4309569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1976.4309569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theory of Nonuniformly Digitized Binary Pictures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Layout","Shape","Humans","Animals","Visual system","Biomedical imaging","Image analysis","Machine vision","Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1976","displayDocTitle":"A Theory of Nonuniformly Digitized Binary Pictures","volume":"SMC-6","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theory of Nonuniformly Digitized Binary Pictures","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v6-n9-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036462S","chronDate":"Sept.  1976","isNumber":"4309562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4309569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4309586,"authors":[{"name":"Robin L.

It has been pointed out, however, that a linear systems analysis of the entire system is not valid. Furthermore, a nonlinear model consisting of a log-bandpass filter produced some experimental results with deviations at high spatial frequencies. A new structure for a nonlinear mathematical model which is easily quantifiable, produces results which compare with experimental data, and has a physiological correlate is presented. The significance of this model is that the bandwidth of the visual system decreases as contrast increases. Thus the system appears to maximize the signal to noise ratio while attempting to maintain a constant \" perceptual\" spatial-frequency fidelity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309674/04309680.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonlinear Model for the Spatial Characteristics of the Human Visual System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Visual system","Frequency","Psychology","Brain modeling","Linear systems","Aerospace electronics","Pattern recognition","Spatial filters","Discrete Fourier transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1977","displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Model for the Spatial Characteristics of the Human Visual System","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1977","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear Model for the Spatial Characteristics of the Human Visual System","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v7-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044052S","chronDate":"March  1977","isNumber":"4309674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"84","articleId":"4309680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4309681,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Persoon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Persoon","id":"37352619600"},{"name":"King-Sun Fu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"King-Sun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37301939400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4309681","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":697,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1781},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape Discrimination Using Fourier Descriptors","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309674/04309681.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309674","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Character recognition","Biological cells","Prototypes","Image processing","Pattern recognition","Skeleton","Layout","Joints","Laboratories"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309681","abstract":"Description or discrimination of boundary curves (shapes) is an important problem in picture processing and pattern recognition.

Often, those in conflict may agree about what the relevant dimensions of value are. The conflicts arise over the relative importance of various goals. Normally, such disagreements are fought out in the contexts of specific decisions, and so are fought out over and over again, at enormous social cost each time another decision must be made. This paper proposes a method that can spell out explicitly what each individual's or group's values are, showing how and how much they differ-and in the process can frequently reduce the extent of such differences. It presents data illustrating the application of this technology, multiattribute utility measurement, to two specific instances: management of the coastal zone of the town of Venice, a part of Los Angeles, CA; and selection of research programs for the Office of Child Development, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In both cases, exploitation of multiattribute utility measurement permits the decisionmaking or regulatory agencies to shift their attention from the specific actions, being regulated to the values these actions serve and the decisionmaking mechanisms that implement these values. In the process, the data show that degree of disagreement about values among holders of conflicting value systems are often reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309720","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309715/04309720.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"326","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Use Multiattribute Utility Measurement for Social Decisionmaking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1977","displayDocTitle":"How to Use Multiattribute Utility Measurement for Social Decisionmaking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309720/","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1977","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Use Multiattribute Utility Measurement for Social Decisionmaking","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v7-n5-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044548S","chronDate":"May  1977","isNumber":"4309715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"506","articleId":"4309720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":4309737,"authors":[{"name":"George N.

Thus no known nonexhaustive sequential k-measurement selection procedure is optimal, even for jointly normal measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309797/04309803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1977.4309803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309797","startPage":"657","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Possible Orderings in the Measurement Selection Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Possible Orderings in the Measurement Selection Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Possible Orderings in the Measurement Selection Problem","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v7-n9-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036293S","chronDate":"Sept.  1977","isNumber":"4309797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"168","articleId":"4309803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4309889,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4309889","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Remote sensing","Cost function","Pattern classification","Engineering drawings","NASA","Sensor systems","Error correction","Probability density function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1978.4309889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309880/04309889.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1978.4309889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Classification in a Time-Varying Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309889/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Classification in a Time-Varying Environment","volume":"8","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Classification in a Time-Varying Environment","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v8-n12-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108431S","chronDate":"Dec.  1978","isNumber":"4309880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4309889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":4309907,"authors":[{"name":"Kar-Keung D.

The control is designed so that a new type of state space trajectories called sliding mode exists. Due to delays, neglected small time constants, and other idealizations, ideal sliding modes as predicted by the theory do not exist. We have verified through hybrid simulation that trajectories which are close to ideal sliding modes exist when the controller is designed according to theory. To illustrate the design procedures, a two-joint manipulator is considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4309901/04309907.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1978.4309907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1978.4309907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4309901","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4309907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controller Design for a Manipulator Using Theory of Variable Structure Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Variable structure systems","Sliding mode control","Manipulator dynamics","Mechanical variables control","Delay effects","Predictive models","Feedback control","State-space methods","Robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Controller Design for a Manipulator Using Theory of Variable Structure Systems","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controller Design for a Manipulator Using Theory of Variable Structure Systems","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v8-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031462S","chronDate":"Feb.  1978","isNumber":"4309901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"405","articleId":"4309907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4309918,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4309999/","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1978","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Textural Features Corresponding to Visual Perception","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textural Features Corresponding to Visual Perception","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v8-n6-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062927S","chronDate":"June  1978","isNumber":"4309992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"1300","articleId":"4309999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"}]
