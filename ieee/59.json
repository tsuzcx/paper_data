The second algorithm requires O(log n) time and O(m) processors or O(log nloglog n) time and O(max{m/log n, n}) processors. The first algorithm is optimal when G is dense, compared with its O(m) time sequential version. The second algorithm has better performance when G is sparse. By using above results, we also present an efficient algorithm for sensitivity analysis of minimum spanning trees which requires O(log n) time and O(max{m, n/sup 2//log n}) processors.

A time shared TMR scheme is used to achieve the error correcting capability. A quarter of the original sorting network based on perfect shuffle is triplicated and voted in each stage. The hardware complexity of this time shared TMR error correcting sorting network is a little more than the original sorting network. The price is that the delay time increases by a factor of 4. However, the throughput penalty can be minimized by pipelining. A technology-independent gate level analysis of hardware complexity and delay time is included in this paper.

It is concluded that, in this redundancy scheme, the sufficient number of spare rows is one or two for practical cases and the gross yield product can be doubled at an early stage of production.

The authors have started a project named CUE (Coordinating Users' requirements and Engineering constraints). The project uses an efficient ultra-multiprocessing capability with overload tolerance and maintainability/expandability, incorporating run-time reconfiguration as essential requirements to realize distributed networking systems such as TINA, which is aimed at the interoperability, reusability and transparency of application software. To satisfy these requirements from engineering viewpoints, the CUE project proposes applying to the network systems an autonomous decentralized data-driven processor which adopts an autonomous execution control scheme in which data packets passing through the pipeline achieve all data transfer, processing and storing/buffering functions in a completely decentralized manner. The processor can therefore perform high flow-rate multimedia streams with considerable flow fluctuations and act as a functional module flexibly adding to/removing from the system at run-time without any overheads. The essential requirements to realize a distributed networking environment such as TINA are first discussed. The applicability of our data-driven processor is shown through actual performance evaluations by the latest VLSI systems. An autonomous run-time reconfiguration scheme in a multiprocessor system is proposed to demonstrate the potential of the data-driven processor. Finally, the current status and future directions of the CUE project are briefly addressed.","doi":"10.1109/ISADS.1997.590603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISADS.1997.590603","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems.

A well-developed telecommunication infrastructure is in place providing high-quality services for both wireline and wireless communications. Hong Kong's application of wireless communicators is among the most active in the world. This has been encouraged by several factors, including the inconvenience of face-to-face communications for people on the move in a densely populated city, the relatively low cost of using wireless communications, the proactive attitude of regulators to adopting new technologies, a population that is not afraid of using new technologies to gain convenience, and strong competition among service providers. The Hong Kong Office of the Telecommunications Authority has awarded licenses for the new PCS-related services, and the government is also increasing funding support for research activities. In this article, the authors first outline Hong Kong's current regulatory and service status in wireless communications and the plan for opening up new PCS. The rest of the article focuses on the research effort in a new university, including development of receivers.","doi":"10.1109/98.590673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.590673","startPage":"30","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/12880/00590673.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless personal communications in Hong Kong: a university perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Wireless personal communications in Hong Kong: a university perspective","publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5578708","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/590673/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless personal communications in Hong Kong: a university perspective","sourcePdf":"00590673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064904S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"3","articleId":"590673","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":590675,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Comparison between simulations and experimental results has been made and is shown for a 1.5-/spl mu/ CMOS current mode amplifier designed for high-rate particle detectors.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1993.590717","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/4489/12733/00590717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1993.590717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12733","startPage":"14.8.1","endPage":"14.8.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new efficient transient noise analysis technique for simulation of CCD image sensors or particle detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=590717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new efficient transient noise analysis technique for simulation of CCD image sensors or particle detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/590717/","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972425","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new efficient transient noise analysis technique for simulation of CCD image sensors or particle detectors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00590717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037904S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1993","isNumber":"12733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489","citationCount":"5","articleId":"590717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":590719,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

Security considerations lead to novel system concepts in chip design including protection of sensitive information and failure detection capabilities. The VLSI chip implements data encryption and decryption in a single hardware unit. All important standardized modes of operation of block ciphers are supported. In addition, new modes are proposed and implemented to fully exploit the algorithm's inherent parallelism. With a system clock frequency of 25 MHz, this device permits a data conversion rate of more than 177 Mbit/s. The chip is the first silicon block encryption device that can be applied to on-line encryption in high-speed networking protocols like ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) or FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface). The high data throughput of 177.8 Mbit/s has been achieved by utilization of a sophisticated pipelining scheme and four full-custom modulo (2/sup 16/ + 1) multipliers. Two unidirectional high-speed 16-bit data ports guarantee continuous occupancy of the encryption unit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/590722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1993","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"VINCI: VLSI implementation of the new secret-key block cipher IDEA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VINCI: VLSI implementation of the new secret-key block cipher IDEA","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00590722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041515S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1993","isNumber":"12733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489","citationCount":"11","articleId":"590722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":590733,"authors":[{"name":"Joongho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Joongho Choi","id":"37087271509"},{"name":"Sa Hyun Bang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sa Hyun Bang","id":"37087488144"},{"name":"B.J.

With a 5 pF capacitance load and 20 cm wire, the ringing amplitude in slow mode is reduced to 1/3 that of the fast mode. Users can choose the operation mode of the output driver according to their application.

The approach is based on applying variants of the counterpropagation NN architecture to the classification of PD patterns. These patterns are derived from physically related discharge parameters, different from those commonly used. It is shown that considerable improvements of the classification quality can be obtained when an extended counterpropagation network with a dynamically changing network topology is applied to patterns that employ the voltage difference between consecutive pulses instead of the phase of occurrence as the main discharge parameter. Furthermore, using a particular parameter vector that takes the correlation between consecutive discharges into account also allows to solve the rejection problem with this type of NN.","doi":"10.1109/94.590861","startPage":"17","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.590861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12720","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/12720/00590861.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PD source identification with novel discharge parameters using counterpropagation neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/590861/","displayDocTitle":"PD source identification with novel discharge parameters using counterpropagation neural networks","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5567443","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PD source identification with novel discharge parameters using counterpropagation neural networks","sourcePdf":"00590861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053085S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"64","articleId":"590861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":590914,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A self adaptive bias circuit for the MOS feedback device establishes the static feedback resistance in the G/spl Omega/ range while tracking the threshold variations and power supply and temperature fluctuations. The linearity of the gain versus input charge has been improved by means of a voltage divider between the output of the charge-sensitive amplifier and the source of the feedback transistor. With the preamplifier alone, we measure a room-temperature equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 9 e/sup -/ rms at 12 usec shaping time. When coupled to a cooled detector a FWHM of 130 eV is obtained at 2.4 usec shaping, corresponding to an ENC of 16 e/sup -/ rms. This is the best reported resolution obtained with a CMOS preamplifier. The circuit has good linearity (<0.2%) up to 1.8 fC. Since the preamplifier's ENC is limited by flicker noise, we fabricated the circuit in two 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS technologies. Device measurements allow us to compare the 1/f noise behavior of each foundry. In addition to the preamplifiers, a 1 us shaper and a 50 /spl Omega/ output driver are included on the die.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.590914","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

Although there is an obvious need for standardisation, this seems difficult to achieve as the links run at different speeds, over different distances and have various constraints of power consumption, size and radiation hardness. An additional complication is that today we cannot decide which will be the most cost effective technology for the implementation of the final links. Furthermore, we must allow designers of boards at each end of the link, for example readout electronics and input buffers, to work in parallel with the development of the links. The S-LINK is a new concept which should provide the benefits of standardisation without the limitations. The S-LINK specification defines, at both ends of the link, a simple FIFO-like user interface which remains independent of the technology used to implement the physical link. The physical link provides transfer of event data and control words, error detection, optional flow control and test facilities. This paper describes the S-LINK specification and gives examples of the use of the S-LINK the physical links being designed, and the test equipment that is being developed.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591032","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The use of narrow windows results in a noisy estimate which requires filtering to prevent significant amplification of noise in the corrected images. Using Monte Carlo simulated projections of a digital model of the anatomy of the torso, we investigated two-dimensional pre-reconstruction filtering of the scatter estimate by the Wiener low-pass filter, and Butterworth low-pass filters with various cutoff frequencies. The scatter estimate was either subtracted from the photopeak window projection or used directly in ordered-subset maximum-likelihood (OS-ML) reconstruction. Using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the estimated and true slices as the criterion, it was observed that: (1) low-pass filtering of the TEW scatter estimate dramatically decreases the NMSE compared to that of no filtering of this estimate; (2) the cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter used to filter the scatter estimate is lower than that typically used for photopeak window images; (3) the cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter has a broad range of values over which the NMSE is near its minimum value; (4) the cutoff frequency at which the Butterworth reaches its minimum value depends on the number of counts in the TEW window(s), and source distribution; (5) the Wiener low-pass filter adapts to produce a low, but not necessarily the minimum, NMSE; and (6) the inclusion of the scatter estimate directly into OS-ML reconstruction results in a lower NMSE than subtraction of the scatter estimate from the photopeak window prior to reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591556","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1081 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

As companies, universities, government agencies, and consortia throughout the world address silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, the supply of less expensive yet high-quality SOI materials is growing, and the grasp of the fabrication process strengthening-both encouraging signs.

Improvements are demanded primarily by three areas of advancing PET state of the art. First, larger detector arrays such as the Hammersmith ECAT(R) EXACT HR/sup ++/ exceed the addressing capacity of 32 bit coincidence event words. Second, better scintillators (LSO) make depth-of-interaction (DOI) and time-of-flight (TOF) operation more practical. Third, fully optimized single photon attenuation correction requires higher rates of data collection. New technologies which enable the proposed third generation Real Time Sorter (RTS III) include: 1) 80 M byte/sec Fibre Channel RAID disk systems, 2) PowerPC on both VMEbus and PCI Local bus, and 3) quadruple interleaved DRAM controller designs. Data acquisition flexibility is enhanced through a wider 64 bit coincidence event word. PET methodology support includes DOI (6 bits), TOF (6 bits), multiple energy windows (6 bits), 512/spl times/512 sinogram indexes (18 bits), and 256 crystal rings (16 bits). Throughput of 10 M events/sec is expected for list-mode data collection as well as both on-line and replay histogramming. Fully efficient list-mode storage for each PET application is provided by real-time bit packing of only the active event word bits. Real-time circuits provide DOI rebinning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591676/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5615227","conferenceDate":"2-9 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Next generation PET data acquisition architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Next generation PET data acquisition architectures","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00591676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034923S","chronDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4502","citationCount":"1","articleId":"591676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":591683,"authors":[{"name":"A.

From the variety of the possible sampling schemes in the axial direction, the data acquisition method that effectively improves the axial uniformity of the data Signal to Noise Ratio and eliminates the resolution artifacts in Whole Body studies, is the continuous spatial sampling scheme. In this work, in addition to the SNR uniformity benefit from the continuous sampling scheme, a gain in the absolute SNR value of the data is investigated. The continuous axial sampling scheme implies that all the data points are sampled with all the detectors in the axial direction hence the efficiencies of the detector system in the axial direction are averaged. As a result the overall variance of the data after the correction for the detector efficiency variation is reduced. A method is developed, that theoretically estimates the overall variance of a data set corrected for detector efficiency, as a function of the normalization correction matrix. This method can be used to predict the relative SNR performance of any PET tomograph under different data sampling schemes. It can also be used for the comparison of the relative data SNR between two PET systems that have the same overall sensitivity but differ in the efficiency uniformity of their detector systems. When the method is used to theoretically predict the overall data variance improvement from the discrete to the continuous sampling scheme for an ECAT EXACT HR PET system, the theoretically calculated values closely match the measured improvements.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591683","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1299 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

Nine flash ADC serve an array of 27 PMT and 784 crystals. The fast signals from one or more PMT clusters are summed. The fast summed signals are thresholded and sent to a programmable logic to determines the probable scintillation zone (4 blocks) and to turn on the associated 9 PMT integrators. After integration, the logic also drives a set of ultra-fast analog switches to connect the flash ADC set to the PMT integration channels in the scintillation zone. The 9 ADC output (integrated pulses with good photon statistics) are latched and compared. The comparator result determines which block in the zone is firing and the appropriate 4 ADC are selected and bused into a position decoder. The decoder outputs the image-slice address and the crystal address. The circuit is pipelined and driven by a 250 MHz master clock. The maximum event-processing rate for the circuit and a random radiation source is 2/spl times/10/sup 6//sec (with 10:1 randomness allowance).","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The system utilizes 240 block detectors, each of which consists of a new compact position-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PS-PMT) and an 8/spl times/4 BGO array. A total number of 7,680 crystals (480 per ring) are positioned to form a 508 mm diameter of 16 detector rings with 7.2 mm pitch and 114 mm axial field of view (FOV). The system is designed to perform activation studies using a monkey in a sitting position. The data can be acquired in either 2D or 3D mode, where the slice collimators are retracted in 3D mode. The transaxial resolution is 2.6 mm FWHM at the center of the FOV, and the average axial resolution on the axis of the ring is 3.3 mm FWHM in the direct slice and 3.2 mm FWHM in the cross slice. The scatter fraction, sensitivity and count rate performance were evaluated for a 10 cm diameter cylindrical phantom. The total system sensitivity is 2.3 kcps/kBq/ml in 2D mode and 22.8 kcps/kBq/ml in 3D mode. The noise equivalent count rate with 3D mode is equivalent to that with 2D mode at five times higher radioactivity level. The applicable imaging capabilities of the scanner was demonstrated by animal studies with a monkey.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.591690","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1334 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The system operates in a Rayleigh flat fading channel and pilot symbols are inserted periodically to the transmitted data for the purpose of channel estimation. We introduced previously a pilot symbol assisted interference canceller that was made up of two parts-a decorrelating receiver for the faded pilot symbols, followed by a successive interference canceller (SIC) for the data symbols. The receiver could operate in small cells with a maximum round trip delay of a quarter of a symbol time and was able to provide a performance improvement over a pure SIC receiver for both the pilot and the data symbols. We introduce two fragile structures that allow the usage of the hybrid receiver in larger cells with a round trip delay of one symbol time. Furthermore, the complexity of the decorrelator is kept at a moderate level. The performance of the hybrid receiver operating on both frame structures is compared and a comparison is made with a pure SIC cancelling receiver. It was found that one of the investigated frame structures in conjunction with the hybrid receiver increased the system capacity as compared to a pure SIC receiver and offers moreover a comparable system complexity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591881","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1451 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pilot symbol assisted interference cancellation scheme for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pilot symbol assisted interference cancellation scheme for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591881/","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690578","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pilot symbol assisted interference cancellation scheme for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05275S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"4","articleId":"591881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":591882,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The scheme operates on the fact that parallel processing simultaneously removes from each user a part of the interference produced by the remaining users accessing the channel, the amount being proportional to their reliability. The parallel processing can be done in multiple stages. The proposed scheme uses tentative decision devices at the multiple stages to produce the most reliably estimated received data for generation and cancellation of user interference. Simulation results are given for a multitude of different situations, in particular, those cases for which the analysis is too complex.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591882.pdf","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1457 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Propulsion","Additive noise","Space technology","Matched filters","Laboratories","Degradation","Parallel processing","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","parallel processing","interference suppression","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear parallel interference cancellation","CDMA","parallel processing","tentative decision devices","multiple stages","simulation results","AWGN channel","multiuser interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690579","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062882S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"21","articleId":"591882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":591883,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

In this paper, we follow the same path by using wavelet based modules in the coding chain. The prediction error signal is obtained by using variable block size motion compensation (VBSMC). Great attention has been paid to smooth the motion vector field, which helps to increase the coding efficiency. After VBSMC, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is then applied to the prediction error signal to obtain wavelet coefficients. Some new schemes are introduced. First, a new and effective hybrid coder using quadtree and lattice vector quantization (QTLVQ) is introduced, which can efficiently code the wavelet coefficients of the motion compensated prediction error signal. Second, a new rate allocation scheme different from traditional ones is introduced, which can flexibly control the coder's output rate and the duality of reconstructed video signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591890.pdf","startPage":"1493","endPage":"1497 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform coding of image sequence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Image sequences","Discrete wavelet transforms","Motion compensation","Wavelet coefficients","Image coding","Entropy coding","Lattices","Vector quantization","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","transform coding","motion compensation","vector quantisation","wavelet transforms","transforms","entropy codes","prediction theory","quadtrees","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform coding","image sequences","MPEG","motion vector field smoothing","image sequence compression","entropy coding","prediction error signal","variable block size motion compensation","coding efficiency","discrete wavelet transform","wavelet coefficients","hybrid coder","quadtree","lattice vector quantization","rate allocation scheme","video signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform coding of image sequence","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform coding of image sequence","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.978053S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","articleId":"591890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":591902,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

However, when strong multipath distortion is present, the orthogonality is destroyed. This paper treats both the analytical and the practical aspect of this problem. A new analytical method is presented for evaluating the performance of the optimal detector with known channel and random orthogonal code. For the practical receiver implementation, we propose a signal processing technique, based on the estimate-maximize algorithm, which iteratively seeks for the maximum likelihood solution. This nonlinear technique is shown to perform much better than the optimal linear solution. The algorithm lends itself to an efficient DSP or VLSI implementation and is combined with coding. A new analytical channel parameter is shown to accurately predict the performance to within /spl plusmn/0.5 dB. The results are also presented in the form of outage probabilities for random Rayleigh multipath against required fading margin.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear multiuser detector for synchronous coded CDMA on severely distorted frequency selective channels","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591905","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591905.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1582 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear multiuser detector for synchronous coded CDMA on severely distorted frequency selective channels","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690602","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear multiuser detector for synchronous coded CDMA on severely distorted frequency selective channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026651S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"2","articleId":"591905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":591906,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For efficient access on the uplink (mobile-to-base), the protocol makes use of the uplink channel status information which is conveyed to the mobile through a busy/idle flag on the downlink (base-to-mobile link). A first-order Markov model is used to describe the packet successes and failures on a Rayleigh fading channel. A closed-form expression for the throughput is derived by modeling the system as a finite-state, discrete-time Markov chain. The analytical results obtained through the first-order Markov approximation of the channel are compared to those obtained from an i.i.d channel model. The Markovian fading channel model is shown to provide better performance results than the i.i.d channel model. Results obtained by direct simulation of the fading process and the protocol operation show that a first-order Markov approximation of the fading process is quite accurate.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591942","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591942.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1773 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a wireless media access protocol on a Markovian fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a wireless media access protocol on a Markovian fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591942/","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5696870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a wireless media access protocol on a Markovian fading channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027165S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"7","articleId":"591942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":591945,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

We first investigate the identifiability of MIMO FIR channels, and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for MIMO FIR channels to be identifiable up to a unitary ambiguity matrix using second-order statistics. Next, we extend the identification algorithms for single-input/multiple-output (SIMO) FIR channels, such as the algebraic algorithm and the subspace algorithm to the identification of MIMO FIR channels. Since the ambiguity matrix cannot be estimated using second-order statistics, we then present a fourth-order cumulant based ambiguity matrix estimation algorithm.

With unique design of the training sequences, the algorithm is capable of rejecting multiuser interference and thus is not near-far limited. It is shown that the total acquisition time for all system users is considerably reduced compared to previously studied CDMA timing acquisition algorithms without increasing the computation complexity. In fact, the computation complexity of the proposed algorithm is also reduced to MN/sub b//sup 2/+(Mlog M)N/sub b/, where M is the number of users in the system and N/sub b/ is the number of samples taken per bit interval. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that the estimation can be obtained with high accuracy even at a very low signal to noise ratio (SNR). For instance, with M=20 and N/sub b/=254, the probability of acquisition error for a user with SNR at -15 dB is on the order of 10/sup -5/.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591948","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591948.pdf","startPage":"1799","endPage":"1803 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast timing estimation for CDMA waveforms in a near-far environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591948/","displayDocTitle":"Fast timing estimation for CDMA waveforms in a near-far environment","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5696876","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast timing estimation for CDMA waveforms in a near-far environment","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027288S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"137","articleId":"591948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":591950,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

The proposed chip-spreading OCDM system is an embodiment of the concept of potential diversity that combines with the path-diversity of the DS/CDMA system and the frequency-diversity of the OFDM/CDMA system. As a result, the bit error rate of the proposed system is much lower than that of the conventional DS/CDMA system which uses maximal ratio combining.

To realistically model a cordless communications system, we also choose the sampling time adaptively. We show that the errors due to ISI go like K(S/T)/sup 2/, where the proportionality constant K depends on the Gaussian filtering, the receiver filtering, and the sampling time. The chosen sampling instants for large group delays depend on the signal-to-noise ratios: for low SNR sampling times near the average mean delay are optimum, while at high SNR, sampling times that are shifted by approximately T/2 are optimum.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591957","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"1845","endPage":"1849 vol.3","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analytical computation of the error probability of (G)MSK with adaptive sampling in mobile radio channels with small delay spread","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5690619","publicationDate":"1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical computation of the error probability of (G)MSK with adaptive sampling in mobile radio channels with small delay spread","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034124S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"1","articleId":"591957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":591971,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The M-ary source coding leads to a lower repetition rate of the used tunable mode locked laser or to a higher data rate than in OOK/CDMA systems.

Multi-rate source and channel coding (MRC) is one of the proposed techniques for link adaptation in future mobile communication systems. A MRC system trades-off the source codec bit rate against channel codec bit rate according to the prevailing channel conditions. This paper presents a CDMA verification environment that allows a comprehensive test of the MRC performance.

Each traffic class has a different requirement on information rate and performance. Given sufficient bandwidth, these requirements can be satisfied by an appropriate assignment of power and processing gain to the users in each class. For a single class of data users we examine the relationship between delay and processing gain. We show that lowering the processing gain below a threshold can produce multiple operating points, which correspond to different delays. Two classes of traffic are then considered corresponding to voice and data, and the delay of the data users is examined as a function of the powers and processing gains assigned to both classes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation of DS-CDMA parameters to achieve multiple rates and qualities of service","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591981","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591981.pdf","startPage":"1974","endPage":"1978 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=591981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of DS-CDMA parameters to achieve multiple rates and qualities of service","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690643","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of DS-CDMA parameters to achieve multiple rates and qualities of service","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028561S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"20","articleId":"591981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":591993,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In a case study we replace the current GSM speech channel coding scheme by this new \"turbo\" scheme leaving all the interleaver interfaces and the total delays unchanged. It is shown that for independent and frequency-hopped Rayleigh channels and other standard GSM channels, the frame error rate and the residual BER of the class 1a bits drop by a factor of 1.4 and 2.0 respectively. Likewise the carrier to interference ratio (CIR) can be lowered by 0.8 dB at the same performance level. Contrary to the common belief that \"turbo\" codes gain only with large interleavers, we have shown that together with UEP they allow gains also with the modest interleaver sizes of the GSM scheme. All this offers a potential for a future evolutionary improvement of the GSM channel coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591993","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00591993.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.591993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2048 vol.3","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"\"Turbo\" decoding with unequal error protection applied to GSM speech coding","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5696899","publicationDate":"1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/591993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\"Turbo\" decoding with unequal error protection applied to GSM speech coding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00591993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038266S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"12","articleId":"591993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":591999,"authors":[{"name":"S.I.

A number of mm-wave signals can be simultaneously generated by using a coherent multi-frequency light source and transported over an optical fiber network. The OFDM signals are demultiplexed and distributed to individual microcell zones. Each pair of lightwaves is converted into a mm-wave at the base station by optical self-heterodyning. The key device to the coherent multi-frequency light source is a stabilized mode-locked laser diode (MLLD) combined with a special class of optical frequency demultiplexing (DEMUX) switch. 60 GHz mm-wave generation and the transport over a 40 km-long optical fiber is successfully demonstrated. The 3 dB linewidth of the generated mm-wave as narrow as 0.3 kHz shows an excellent frequency stability of the light source.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.592016","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12813/00592016.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2169 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.592016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60 GHz millimeter-wave generation and transport using stabilized mode-locked laser diode with optical frequency DEMUX switch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592016/","displayDocTitle":"60 GHz millimeter-wave generation and transport using stabilized mode-locked laser diode with optical frequency DEMUX switch","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5696897","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60 GHz millimeter-wave generation and transport using stabilized mode-locked laser diode with optical frequency DEMUX switch","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00592016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054337S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"20","articleId":"592016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":592073,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A DCS can be classified in two types according to the characteristics of the processors on a network: a distributed homogeneous system (DHOS) and a distributed heterogeneous system (DHES). The paper defines a general model for a DHOS and a DHES and presents a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the task scheduling problem in the defined DCS. The performance of the proposed GA is compared with the list scheduling algorithm in a DHOS and with the one-level reach-out greedy algorithm (OLROG) in a DHES.

In general, both I/O bandwidth and reliability can be significantly improved by using disk array systems, i.e., RAID. However, the performance of RAID systems can be significantly degraded where small read/write accesses are frequently requested. Thus, the dual head disk structure is applied to improve the performance of RAID systems. The dual head disk model can reduce not only the maximum seek time but also the average seek time by dividing the disk surface into two separated regions, one for each head. To compare the performance of the dual head RAID (DH-RAID) system with the conventional RAID systems, simulations are performed with two types of RAID configurations and several workloads. Simulation results show higher performance can be obtained by DH-RAID systems as compared with the conventional RAID systems. The DH-RAID model can provide better performance in the application environment that has a relatively high seek time ratio.","doi":"10.1109/HPC.1997.592168","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings High Performance Computing on the Information Superhighway.

Adjustments for different selection intensities are considered and computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592259","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592259.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The gambler's ruin problem, genetic algorithms, and the sizing of populations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"The gambler's ruin problem, genetic algorithms, and the sizing of populations","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5573017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The gambler's ruin problem, genetic algorithms, and the sizing of populations","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045998S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"55","articleId":"592259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":592262,"authors":[{"name":"U.K. Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"U.K.","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37534357900"},{"name":"H.

In our multicriteria optimization application there are as many sexes as optimization criteria and each individual is evaluated according to the optimization criterion related to its sex. Furthermore, a multi-parent crossover is applied to generate offspring of parents belonging to all different sexes, so the offspring represents intermediate solutions not totally optimal with respect to any single criterion.

In order to avoid this undesirable tendency, an adaptive non-uniform mutation operator is proposed, the development of which rests on the mathematical analysis. Experimental results for a standard numerical parameter optimization problem are given that illustrate the superiority of this novel mutation operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592275/","accessionNumber":"5573032","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical analysis of the non-uniform mutation operator for the modified genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical analysis of the non-uniform mutation operator for the modified genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033802S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"21","articleId":"592275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":592276,"authors":[{"name":"I.K.

Mutation is widely regarded as critical to preserve diversity in recombination dominant GAs, as well as a powerful search heuristic in its own right; mutation is central to recent GA convergence proofs. The paper examines an alternate genetic algorithm with no explicit mutation operator. The Complementary Surrogate GA (CSGA) uses traditional crossover operators, but guarantees recombination access to the complete search space by modifying the GA population structure. Complementary Surrogate Sets (CSS) within the population ensure allele diversity at each locus, while allowing standard selection methods to work as expected. A proof of convergence is provided as well as the results of an empirical study examining the CSGA using various CSS strategies on standard function optimization benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592276","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592276.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing recombination with the Complementary Surrogate Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Biological cells","Cascading style sheets","Convergence","Genetic programming","Protection","Cities and towns","Encoding","Functional programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems","set theory","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Complementary Surrogate Genetic Algorithm","recombination enhancement","finite populations","mutation","recombination dominant GAs","search heuristic","GA convergence proofs","Complementary Surrogate GA","recombination access","search space","Complementary Surrogate Sets","allele diversity","standard selection methods","empirical study","standard function optimization benchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing recombination with the Complementary Surrogate Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5573033","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing recombination with the Complementary Surrogate Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048161S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"4","articleId":"592276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":592277,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

The problem of ICR, i.e. the task to assign channels to newcoming requests with the twofold issue of obtaining the least number of employed channels while no overlapped isochronous requests/connections share the same isochronous channel(s), is an NP complete optimization problem (Nen-Fu Huang and Huey-Ing Liu, 1994). The special features of the proposed algorithm, which we call Hybrid Genetic Reuse Algorithm (HGRA), that distinguish HGRA from the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) (D.E. Goldber, 89) are: (1) a binary two dimensional encoding; (2) the use of a more advanced fitness function in the phase of selection; (3) a repair strategy until a feasible solution is produced; and (4) a local improvement operator. The computational complexity is also computed. The proposed algorithm was tested through simulation on a dual bus Metropolitan Area Network (DQDB) and was compared to a graph coloring algorithm named ICRA (Nen-Fu Huang and Huey-Ing Liu, 1994), presented on a DQDB network. The experimental results indicate that a genetic algorithm, with its properties: robustness, implicit parallelism, combination and exploration capabilities hybridized with a strong local search algorithm, can be used for finding good solutions for the problem of ICR, with good scalability property, comparable to those of ICRA and even better in case of heavy network load.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592283","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592283.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the provision of isochronous service in high speed networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the provision of isochronous service in high speed networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5577834","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the provision of isochronous service in high speed networks","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033295S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"3","articleId":"592283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":592288,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To alleviate this difficulty, we developed a hybrid approach that combines a GA with a stochastic variant of the simplex method in function optimization. Our motivation for developing the stochastic simplex method is to introduce a cost-effective exploration component into the conventional simplex method. In an attempt to make effective use of the simplex operation in a hybrid GA framework, we used an elite-based hybrid architecture that applies one simplex step to a top portion of the ranked population. We compared our approach with five alternative optimization techniques, including another simplex-GA hybrid, developed independently by Renders and Bersini (1994), and adaptive simulated annealing (ASA). We used two function optimization problems to compare our approach with the five alternative methods. Overall, these tests showed that our hybrid approach is an effective and robust optimization technique. We also tested our hybrid GA on the seven function benchmark problems on real space and showed its results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5573047","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A simplex genetic algorithm hybrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplex genetic algorithm hybrid","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024249S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"9","articleId":"592291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":592294,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Some research projects based on AdAM are also presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592294.pdf","endPage":"196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AdAM: a hardware evolutionary system","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592294","startPage":"193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"AdAM: a hardware evolutionary system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592294/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5573050","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AdAM: a hardware evolutionary system","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021983S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"14","articleId":"592294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":592309,"authors":[{"name":"P.

DNA computation, however, is implemented with chemical reactions between the nucleotide bases, and therefore, the results can be error-prone. Application of DNA based computation to traditional computing paradigms requires error-free computation, which the DNA chemistry is unable to support. Careful encoding of the nucleotide sequences can alleviate the production of errors, but these good encodings are difficult to find. In this paper, an algorithm for evolutionary computation with DNA is sketched. Evolutionary computation does not require error-free DNA chemistry, and in fact, takes advantage of errors to produce change and variation in the population. An application of the DNA based evolution program to a search for good DNA encodings is sketched.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592311.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DNA based implementation of an evolutionary search for good encodings for DNA computation","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A DNA based implementation of an evolutionary search for good encodings for DNA computation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5573063","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DNA based implementation of an evolutionary search for good encodings for DNA computation","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043831S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"42","articleId":"592311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":592312,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Existing methods to handle constraints in GA are often computationally expensive, problem dependent or constraint specific. We introduce an idea of constraint consistent GA (CCGA) as an attempt to overcome those drawbacks. Constraint handling is based on general constraint consistency methods that prune the search space and thus reduce the search effort in CCGA. Unfeasible solutions are detected and eliminated from the search space at each stage of the CCGA simulation process to support genetic operations in producing feasible solutions. A number of well known standard genetic operators are adapted to take advantage of provided constraint consistency during initialization, crossover and mutation. Initial experiments indicate that in the terms of the solution quality and the number of iterations the constraint consistency based approach in CCGA can outperform other constraint handling methods in GA for a number of selected test problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592333","startPage":"343","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592333.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint consistent genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592333/","displayDocTitle":"Constraint consistent genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5573076","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint consistent genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098304S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"14","articleId":"592333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":592335,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Because a variety of network optimization problems may be solved, either exactly or approximately, by identifying shortest path, this studies will provide a base for constructing efficient solution procedures for shortest path-based network optimization problems. The proposed approach has been tested on three randomly generated problems with different size from 6 nodes to 70 nodes and from 10 edges to 211 edges. The experiment results are very encouraging: it can find the known optimum very rapidly with very high probability.

One such technique is vector quantization, which maps groups of input symbols, called vectors, onto a small set of vectors, called the codebook. Each vector in the codebook is a codeword. The indexes of the codewords represent the original vectors, and writing the codewords that the indexes indicate restores a facsimile of the original data. The similarity of the restored data to the original under vector quantization depends on the codebook, and several algorithms have been proposed for designing it from a training set of typical vectors. This paper describes a genetic algorithm for the problem of codebook design. The genetic algorithm's chromosomes represent partitions of the training set; each vector maps to the codeword that is the centroid of its set in the partition. To speed up its operation, the genetic algorithm uses fitness inheritance to assign fitness values to most new chromosomes, rather than evaluating them. Tests using five standard digitized images compare the genetic algorithm to a popular non-genetic algorithm for codebook design. The genetic algorithm is found to be effective, but slow.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592366/","accessionNumber":"5573105","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of vector quantization codebooks using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of vector quantization codebooks using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028827S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"10","articleId":"592366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":592369,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

These techniques perform well on a test problem: multiprocessor scheduling problem for robot control computation.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592372","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592372.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"556","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phenotypic genetic algorithm for partitioning problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Phenotypic genetic algorithm for partitioning problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5577837","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phenotypic genetic algorithm for partitioning problem","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025171S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"2","articleId":"592372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":592379,"authors":[{"name":"N.E.

The new operator adaptively decides the division points of each chromosome for the bacterial mutation and the cutting points for the crossover.

The only practical way is to design modular neural network systems consisting of simple modules. While there has been a lot of work on combining different modules in a modular system in the fields of neural networks, statistics and machine learning, little work has been done on how to design those modules automatically and how to exploit the interaction between individual module design and module combination. This paper proposes an evolutionary approach to designing modular neural networks. The approach addresses the issue of automatic determination of the number of individual modules and the exploitation of the interaction between individual module design and module combination. The relationship among different modules is considered during the module design. This is quite different from the conventional approach where the module design is separated from the module combination. Experimental results on some benchmark problems are presented and discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592382","startPage":"605","endPage":"610","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592382.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving modular neural networks which generalise well","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Australia","Computational intelligence","Computer science","Educational institutions","Computer network management","Machine learning","Training data","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","genetic algorithms","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolving modular neural networks","monolithic neural network","statistics","machine learning","module design","module combination","evolutionary approach","benchmark problems","generalisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Evolving modular neural networks which generalise well","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5573119","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving modular neural networks which generalise well","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0355S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"1","articleId":"592382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":592384,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The determination of the antecedent structure of the fuzzy model, i.e. input variables and the number of membership functions for the inputs, has been one of the most important problems of fuzzy modeling. The authors propose a hierarchical fuzzy modeling method using fuzzy neural networks (FNN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). This method can identify fuzzy models of nonlinear objects with strong nonlinearities. The disadvantage of this method is that the training of the FNN is time consuming. This paper presents a quick method for rough search for proper structures in the antecedent of fuzzy models. The fine tuning of the acquired rough model is done by the FNNs. This modeling method is quite efficient to identify precise fuzzy models of systems with strong nonlinearities.

Mutation is used as usual. Nessy algorithm can be characterized as an individual evolutionary algorithm, but as a neural network too. It was designed for image processing applications. A short example is presented, where the discriminative feature of two images is successfully detected by the proposed evolutionary neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592390/","accessionNumber":"5577838","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network that uses evolutionary learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network that uses evolutionary learning","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02815S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"2","articleId":"592390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":592393,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Bae Cho","affiliation":["ATR Human Information Processing Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan","Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Bae Cho","id":"37087142664"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3949-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"592393","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Evolutionary computation","Artificial neural networks","Information processing","Biological system modeling","Humans","Evolution (biology)","Handwriting recognition","Genetics","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","genetic algorithms","character recognition","handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular neural networks","evolutionary algorithm","performance","potential networks","handwritten numerals recognition","gene pool"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592393","abstract":"The evolutionary approach to artificial neural networks has been developing rapidly in recent years and shows great possibility as a powerful tool.

As a matter of fact, with most real-world applications, not even human experts who are familiar with the problem can give accurate guidelines for the construction of the TDS. In order to automate this process, we investigate the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) for the selection of appropriate input patterns for the TDS. The parallel netGEN system, which uses a GA to generate problem-adapted generalized multilayer perceptrons trained by error backpropagation, has been extended to evolve (sub)-optimal TDSs.

The PNN can activate radial basis functions as well as sigmoid functions with a special type of hidden nodes. The evolutionary learning algorithm for the PNN not only trains the parameters and the connection weights but also optimizes the network structure. The structure optimization strategy not only determines the number of hidden nodes necessary to represent a given target function, but also decides whether the role of each hidden node is a radial basis function node or a sigmoid function node. In order to apply the algorithm, a PNN is realized by a self-organizing genotype representation with a linked-list data structure. Simulations show that the algorithm can build a PNN with less hidden nodes than are required by the existing learning algorithm, which uses error backpropagation (EBP) and the network growing strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592399","startPage":"667","endPage":"671","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592399.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary projection neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592399/","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary projection neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5573129","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary projection neural networks","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032446S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"4","articleId":"592399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":592401,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In our approach, a fuzzy IF-THEN rule is generated by assigning a circular cone-type membership function and a certainty grade to each training pattern. Thus, each fuzzy IF-THEN rule can be viewed as a kind of nearest-neighbor classifier, which has its own certainty grade as well as its own localized receptive field specified by the radius of the circular cone-type membership function. A genetic algorithm is employed for selecting a small number of training patterns that are used for generating fuzzy IF-THEN rules. Our genetic algorithm has three objectives: to minimize the error rate, the rejection rate and the number of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. We also show that the fuzzy rule-based classification system constructed by the genetic algorithm can be represented by a neural network architecture that is similar to nearest-neighbor neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592401","startPage":"673","endPage":"678","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592401.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of fuzzy nearest neighbor neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Nearest neighbor searches","Neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy sets","Pattern classification","Fuzzy reasoning","Error analysis","Knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","neural net architecture","genetic algorithms","pattern classification","minimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy nearest-neighbour neural net evolution","genetic algorithm","compact fuzzy rule-based classification systems","fuzzy IF-THEN rule minimization","circular cone-type membership function","certainty grade","training patterns","nearest-neighbour classifier","localized receptive field","error rate minimization","rejection rate minimization","neural network architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of fuzzy nearest neighbor neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5573130","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of fuzzy nearest neighbor neural networks","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051559S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"2","articleId":"592401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":592405,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The test bed used for this study has been the game of draughts (checkers). A pool of draughts programs are played against each other in a round robin (all-play-all) tournament to evaluate the fitness of each 'player' and a GA is used to preserve and improve the best performers. Some solutions to the problems of attempting to compare the absolute performance of possible solutions in this area which is mainly about relative abilities are presented. Comparisons with classical methods and results are also briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1997.592428","startPage":"715","endPage":"720","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4619/12988/00592428.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1997.592428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning using a genetic algorithm to optimise a draughts program board evaluation function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Genetic algorithms","Humans","Electronic mail","Testing","Performance evaluation","Optimization methods","Databases","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","learning (artificial intelligence)","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","genetic algorithm","draughts program board evaluation function optimisation","board evaluation function","game playing program","checkers game","draughts programs","round robin tournament","GA","absolute performance","relative abilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning using a genetic algorithm to optimise a draughts program board evaluation function","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5573137","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning using a genetic algorithm to optimise a draughts program board evaluation function","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00592428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051263S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4619","citationCount":"2","articleId":"592428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":592474,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Most of the candidate blocks can be rejected only by calculating one or more of the three fast matching error measures. The time-consuming computations of MSE or MAE are performed on only a few candidate blocks that first pass all three fast matching criteria. Simulation results show that a reduction of over 86% in computations is achieved after integrating the three fast matching criteria into the full-search algorithm, while ensuring optimal accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast full-search block-matching algorithm for motion-compensated video compression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.592551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/12974/00592551.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast full-search block-matching algorithm for motion-compensated video compression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5625751","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast full-search block-matching algorithm for motion-compensated video compression","sourcePdf":"00592551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031402S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"72","articleId":"592551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":592552,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Errors occur if the normalized phasor of the channel impulse response falls into certain error regions; the computation of these regions gives physical insights into the error mechanism and allows a highly efficient computation of the average bit-error rate (BER). The average BER varies as K/spl middot/(S/T)/sup 2/, where S is the RMS delay spread and T is the bit length. The proportionality constant K depends on the Gaussian filtering in the transmitter, the receiver filtering, and the amount of oversampling.

Under fairly general conditions, a channel affected by fading can be turned into an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel by increasing the number of diversity branches. Consequently, it can be expected (and is indeed verified by our analyses and simulations) that a coded modulation scheme designed to be optimal for the AWGN channel also will perform asymptotically well on a fading channel with diversity. This paper presents bounds on the bit-error probability of a system with coded modulation and diversity for space- and time-correlated Rician flat fading. Specifically, we derive a new method which allows evaluation of the pairwise error probability extremely easily, as well as accurately and computationally fast. The accuracy achieved improves considerably on the widely used, but rather loose Chernoff bound. Starting from this analysis, we study the asymptotic behavior of the fading channel with diversity as the number of diversity branches increases, and we address the effects of diversity on coded modulation performance and design criteria, including the effect on interleaver depth (which affects the total delay of the system).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/12974/00592556.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.592556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of diversity reception on fading channels with coded modulation.

They are obtained by truncating the IIR detectors or by finding optimal FIR detectors. The signature waveforms are not restricted to be time-invariant (periodic over symbol interval). Thus, linear multiuser detection is generalized to systems with spreading sequences longer than the symbol interval. Conditions for the stability of the truncated detectors are discussed. Stable truncated detectors are shown to be near-far resistant if the received powers are upper bounded, and if the memory length is large enough (but finite). Numerical examples demonstrate that moderate memory lengths are sufficient to obtain the performance of the IIR detectors even with a severe near-far problem.","doi":"10.1109/26.592564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/12974/00592564.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12974","startPage":"611","endPage":"622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite memory-length linear multiuser detection for asynchronous CDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite memory-length linear multiuser detection for asynchronous CDMA communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5625761","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite memory-length linear multiuser detection for asynchronous CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"00592564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047875S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"75","articleId":"592564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":592569,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This algorithm jointly estimates the filter and desired signal amplitude using a stochastic approximation of the EM algorithm. The performance characteristics of the proposed algorithms are shown by output signal-to-interference ratio and bit-error-rate simulation results. The results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the existing adaptive algorithms in steady state.","doi":"10.1109/82.592574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/12990/00592574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.592574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12990","startPage":"453","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized projection algorithm for blind interference suppression in DS/CDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized projection algorithm for blind interference suppression in DS/CDMA communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5620351","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized projection algorithm for blind interference suppression in DS/CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"00592574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040154S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"35","articleId":"592574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":592577,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

We present a set of new algorithms for low power and high-speed realization of FIR filters. The algorithms use various orders of differences between coefficients for computing the convolution. Also the results of computations are stored and reused, thus requiring more storage and storage accesses. These techniques result in a reduction in the net computations necessary per convolution as compared to directly using the coefficients. It is shown analytically that this computational reduction at the cost of more storage can result in a lower net computational energy dissipated and an enhanced speed.

Through wide variations of the design space parameters, the general trend that is observed is that short, fast circuits tend to favor an analog implementation, while longer, slower circuits make a digital implementation more appropriate. A methodology is provided for choosing the preferable circuit-implementing technology when power consumption-as a function of data precision, filter length, operating frequency, technology scaling, and the maturity of the fabrication process-is used as the primary metric of comparison. It is shown that neither the analog nor the digital matched filter implementation is universally more power efficient than the other. Rather, a surface is mapped in the multidimensional design space where, on one side of this surface, a digital solution is preferable, while on the other side of the surface, an analog circuit is appropriate. Equations are given which delineate the position of this transitional surface in terms of the design space parameters, and example calculations and plots depicting the regions of dominance for the digital and analog matched filters for specific process and system parameters are presented.","doi":"10.1109/82.592584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/12990/00592584.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.592584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of analog and digital circuit implementations of low power matched filters for use in portable wireless communication terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592584/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of analog and digital circuit implementations of low power matched filters for use in portable wireless communication terminals","volume":"44","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5620357","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of analog and digital circuit implementations of low power matched filters for use in portable wireless communication terminals","sourcePdf":"00592584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069786S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"23","articleId":"592584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":592586,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An unbiased timing-error estimate can then be obtained by subtracting this bias term from the output of the timing-error detector. Simulation results are included to show the performance improvement realizable by employing this method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Clocks","Synchronization","Timing","Detectors","Filters","Sampling methods","Transmitters","Low-frequency noise","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","error statistics","timing","signal sampling","digital filters","synchronisation","receivers","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unbiased timing-error estimation","nonideal interpolation","bias term","digital receivers","fixed clock","signal sampling","bias error","symbol timings","timing-error detector","simulation","performance","synchronisation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.592601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12991/00592601.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbiased timing-error estimation in the presence of nonideal interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unbiased timing-error estimation in the presence of nonideal interpolation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592601/","volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5625769","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbiased timing-error estimation in the presence of nonideal interpolation","sourcePdf":"00592601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06345S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"592601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":592602,"authors":[{"name":"Lihbor Yiin","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Inc., Allentown, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Lihbor Yiin","id":"37346991600"},{"name":"G.L.

An equivalent discrete-time (DT) model is developed by combining the tapped-delay-line (TDL) model of the frequency-selective channel and by oversampling at the receiver. The (noninterleaved) fractionally spaced maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) equalizer performs continuous phase modulation (CPM) demodulation, trellis-coded modulation (TCM) decoding, and channel equalization by exploiting the finite state nature of the ISI-corrupted TC-CPM signal. Both simulation and analytical results show diversity-like improvement when performing joint MLSE decoding and equalization. For the interleaved soft-output equalizer, the soft symbol metric is delivered to the TCM decoder by using a forward and backward recursion algorithm. Three variants of the soft-output equalizer are examined. We conclude that the backward recursion is essential to partial response CPM schemes, and with moderate complexity, the soft-output equalizer can have a substantial advantage over a noninterleaved MLSE equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/26.592602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12991/00592602.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12991","startPage":"651","endPage":"659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLSE and soft-output equalization for trellis-coded continuous phase modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MLSE and soft-output equalization for trellis-coded continuous phase modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5625770","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLSE and soft-output equalization for trellis-coded continuous phase modulation","sourcePdf":"00592602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033437S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","articleId":"592602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":592604,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we study the second- and third-order statistics of the residual error process when block transmissions are performed over a bursty channel. The effect of interleaving is explicitly studied. The conditions under which a Markovian model for the block errors is adequate are identified.

It is pointed out that in contrast to the case of the optimal multiuser detector, the choice of the receiver filter severely influences the performance of suboptimal multiuser detectors. Simulation results supported by analysis show that breadth-first tree-search algorithms using a decorrelating noise whitening receiver filter perform better than similar receivers, which solely use a matched filter (MF) for virtually all nonsingular spreading code sets studied. Most of the code sets are randomly generated. The M- and T-algorithm detectors based on decorrelating noise whitening filter (WF) outputs can achieve near optimum performance at a very low complexity compared to the optimal detector, although the proposed detectors are more complex than some known suboptimum detectors. Furthermore, the use of combining techniques is considered for a two-path Rayleigh-fading channel, and a semi-synchronous CDMA structure is proposed. It is shown that if maximum ratio combining (MRC) is employed, the decorrelating noise WF still exists. The corresponding suboptimal combining detector with a decorrelating noise WF outperforms a similar noncombining detector.","doi":"10.1109/26.592610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12991/00592610.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near optimum tree-search detection schemes for bit-synchronous multiuser CDMA systems over Gaussian and two-path Rayleigh-fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Near optimum tree-search detection schemes for bit-synchronous multiuser CDMA systems over Gaussian and two-path Rayleigh-fading channels","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5625775","volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near optimum tree-search detection schemes for bit-synchronous multiuser CDMA systems over Gaussian and two-path Rayleigh-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00592610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043287S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"60","articleId":"592610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":592616,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We propose two multichannel time slot sorters which sort N/sup 2/ time-division multiplexed (TDM) optical inputs, arranged as N frames with N time slots per frame using O(Nlog/sup 2/N) optical switch elements. The TDM optical inputs are sorted in place without expanding the space-time fabric into a space-division switch. The hardware components used are 2/spl times/2 optical switches (LiNbO/sub 3/ directional couplers) and optical delay lines connected in a feedforward fashion. Two space-time variants of the spatial odd-even merge algorithm are used to design the sorters. By maintaining the number of shift-exchange operations invariant at each stage, the proposed sorters use fewer switches than previously proposed sorters using switches with feedback line delays. The use of local control at each 2/spl times/2 switch makes the proposed sorters more practical for high-speed optical inputs than Benes-based time slot permuters with global control and high latency, which affects interframe distance. Both time slot sorters support pipelining of input frames and sorted outputs are available at each time slot after an initial frame delay. The proposed sorters find practical application in the time-domain equivalents of space-division, nonblocking, self-routing packet switches using the sort-banyan architecture, such as the Starlite switch, Sunshine switch, etc.","doi":"10.1109/26.592616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12991/00592616.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.592616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical TDM sorting networks for high-speed switching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=592616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/592616/","displayDocTitle":"Optical TDM sorting networks for high-speed switching","volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5625778","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical TDM sorting networks for high-speed switching","sourcePdf":"00592616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038623S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"592616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":593008,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The generation of high-power microwave (HPM) pulses from a VIRCATOR that has a slow-wave structure in the drift region downstream of the foil anode is discussed. The goals of this work are to demonstrate frequency-stabilized performance without the use of resonant cavities and to increase efficiency in the conversion of electron beam energy into HPM. The drift region is occupied by a slow-wave structure similar to that found in a backward-wave oscillator. An intense relativistic electron beam is introduced into the drift region, causing a virtual cathode to form. The slow-wave structure provides a feedback on the virtual cathode's frequency of oscillation via space charge cloud electromagnetic fields. Simulations indicate that the slow-wave structure can tune the frequency of operation quite well, but does little to improve the conversion efficiency. The authors have tested two structures in the laboratory and found reasonably good agreement with the simulation. The devices operate at about 1.8 GHz and appear to have a 5-10% bandwidth.

The architecture is scalable for different filter length (divisible by 2) and different octave levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high speed array architecture for 2-D wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.593135","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4494/12825/00593135.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1242 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.593135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A high speed array architecture for 2-D wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5615155","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high speed array architecture for 2-D wavelet transform","confLoc":"Ames, IA, USA","sourcePdf":"00593135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032727S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494","citationCount":"4","articleId":"593135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":593136,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.H.B.

In addition, the Kerr effect is used to create optical connections by applying patterns of irradiance to thin layers of the nonlinear media.

Numbers are represented in floating-point format with 1 bit mantissa and 2 bits in the exponent for the states, and 1 bit mantissa and 4 bit exponent for the gradients, while the weights are 16 bit fixed-point numbers. In this way, all the computations can be executed with shift and add operations. Large networks with over 100000 weights were trained and demonstrated the same performance as networks computed with full precision. An estimate of a circuit implementation shows that a large network can be placed on a single chip, reaching more than 1 billion weight updates per second.

This paper attempts to address the issues concerning 'in-situ' learning with analogue VLSI multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. In particular, the authors propose that 'chip-in-the-loop' learning is, at the very least, necessary to overcome typical analogue process variations and the authors argue that MLPs containing analogue circuits with 8 bit precision can be successfully trained provided they have digital representations of the weights of at least 12 bits. The authors demonstrate that weight perturbation, with careful choice of the perturbation size, gives improved results over backpropagation, at the cost of increased training time. Indeed, the authors go on to show why weight perturbation is possibly the only sensible way to implement MLP 'on-chip' learning. The authors have designed a set of analogue VLSI chips specifically to see if their theoretical results on learning work in practice. Although these chips are experimental, it is their intention to use them to solve 'real world' problems which have relatively low input dimensionality, such as the task of speaker identification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning with analogue VLSP MLPs","doi":"10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593184","startPage":"67","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12740","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/4493/12740/00593184.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning with analogue VLSP MLPs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4916997","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning with analogue VLSP MLPs","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"00593184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028142S","chronDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"12740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4493","citationCount":"7","articleId":"593184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":593185,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

The hardware implementation works as a neural coprocessor connected to a personal computer by a special asynchronous interface. The coprocessor consists of several equal submodules representing one column of the neural net. So the architecture allows to compose any size of neural net depending on the specific application and, additionally, recurrency is allowed. Kobold speeds up the performance in contrast to earlier hardware implementations because of its new specialized control and communication structure. The subprocessors communicate asynchronously and locally with their nearest neighbours and synchronously by a global bus. The operations are controlled by dataflow. This means, a neuron calculates its weighted sum as soon as all inputs are available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kobold: a neural coprocessor for backpropagation with online learning","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593222","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/4493/12740/00593222.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"117","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00593222.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Kobold: a neural coprocessor for backpropagation with online learning","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kobold: a neural coprocessor for backpropagation with online learning","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"00593222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03269S","chronDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"12740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4493","citationCount":"1","articleId":"593222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":593229,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Numerous papers show that small size analogue networks operate correctly. However, real ANN applications will require large networks. On the other hand, all of the presented implementations of ANN have been supposed to be working in ideal conditions but real applications will be subject to some global perturbations. For the analogue and mixed digital/analogue implementation cases, the behaviour analysis of the neural network with perturbation conditions is thus inevitable. Unfortunately, very few papers analyse the behaviour of analogue neural network with global perturbations. In this paper we present the behaviour analysis of a CMOS analogue implementation of the synchronous Boltzmann machine model with physical temperature perturbations. The relation between the T parameter of the Boltzmann machine's model and the physical temperature of circuit has been established. Simulation results have been given, temperature effects compensation have been discussed and finally, experimental results have been presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593262","startPage":"170","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/4493/12740/00593262.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature effects modelling and compensation analysis in analogue implementation of stochastic artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Stochastic processes","Subspace constraints","Semiconductor device modeling","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","CMOS analog integrated circuits","Circuit simulation","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature effects modelling","compensation analysis","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","stochastic ANN","artificial neural networks","global perturbations","behaviour analysis","synchronous Boltzmann machine model","physical temperature perturbations","T parameter","temperature effects compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Temperature effects modelling and compensation analysis in analogue implementation of stochastic artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4917010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature effects modelling and compensation analysis in analogue implementation of stochastic artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"00593262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065567S","chronDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"12740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4493","articleId":"593262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":593263,"authors":[{"name":"J.V.

The stimulation patterns were designed by analyzing gravitation potential needed for the cycling movement of the lower limbs against a frictionless cycling ergometer and the response delay of electrically stimulated muscles. To simplify the cycling control system, the stimulation patterns were fixed and only the single gain of the stimulation patterns was adjusted via a feedback control algorithm. To circumvent the complexity involved with exactly modeling a stimulated muscle and cycling ergometer, a model-free fuzzy logic controller (FLC) was adopted herein for the authors' control scheme. Comparison between FLC and conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controllers demonstrated that the PLC with asymmetrical membership function enabled the subject with paraplegia to maintain varied desired cycling speeds, particularly at lower cycling speed.

This model is developed specifically for skeletal muscle activated by functional electrical stimulation (FES). The reverse-order recruitment dynamics of PES activated systems are modeled, as are the underlying processes of force generation in mammalian muscle. The resulting system model is both nonlinear and highly coupled, reflecting the fundamental structure and behavior of skeletal muscle. A new heterogeneous model structure for a contractile element is also presented that overcomes many of the problems which arise when attempting to describe all possible contraction modes. It is found that the new model is robust, numerically stable, and easily implemented. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the model's ability to capture a variety of nonlinear behaviors observed in skeletal muscle activated by FES. Significant insight into the internal dynamics of force development in FES muscle may also be gained from the model. This model is intended as a possible alternative to those currently available in the literature. It may be of use to those conducting research into the modeling, control and optimization of FES generated motion, and neural feedback systems.","doi":"10.1109/86.593289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/12992/00593289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.593289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12992","startPage":"179","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nonlinear mathematical model of electrically stimulated skeletal muscle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A nonlinear mathematical model of electrically stimulated skeletal muscle","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5620811","pubMedId":"9184904","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nonlinear mathematical model of electrically stimulated skeletal muscle","sourcePdf":"00593289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070489S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"29","articleId":"593289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":593305,"authors":[{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Li Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"M.

This extension is motivated by the observation of wide variations in the trajectories of the acoustic data in fluent, speaker-independent speech associated with a fixed underlying linguistic unit. It is also motivated by potential use of mixtures of trend functions to characterize heterogeneous time-varying data generated from distinctive sources such as the speech signals collected from different microphones or from different telephone channels. We show how HMMs with mixtures of trend functions can be implemented simply in the already well-established single-trend HMM framework via the device of expanding each state into a set of parallel states. Details of a maximum-likelihood-based (ML-based) algorithm are given for estimating state-dependent mixture trajectory parameters in the model. Experimental results on the task of classifying speaker-independent vowels excised from the TIMIT data base demonstrate consistent performance improvement using phonemic mixture-trended HMMs over their single-trend counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/89.593305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/12993/00593305.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.593305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12993","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-independent phonetic classification using hidden Markov models with mixtures of trend functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-independent phonetic classification using hidden Markov models with mixtures of trend functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5635758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-independent phonetic classification using hidden Markov models with mixtures of trend functions","sourcePdf":"00593305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043154S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"12993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"33","articleId":"593305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":593319,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The chip realizes a fully connected single-layer network, configurable as a 48 input/48 output neurons with 2304 5-bit synapses or as a 24 input/24 output neurons with 1152 9-bit synapses. This single layer network can be reconfigured as a multi-layer network. Another important chip feature is the possibility of connecting the chips in order to obtain a more complex multi-layer neural network. The core of the authors' architecture is a very efficient circuit block, \"distributed sigmoid-synapse\", that they used to implement each of the 2304 5-bit synapses included in the programmable neural network. A prototyping chip, including all the basic block of neural architecture, is now processed by ES2 with 1.0 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. Finally, the authors report the architecture of a possible system for the evaluation of the VLSI chip performances. Parameter mismatches present in the chip were considered to be not critical because it is possible to account them during the training of the neural network by using a special chip-in-the-loop training algorithm.

Unfortunately their classical look-up table hardware implementation needs an external board that does not allow high speed real world applications. In this paper we introduce a new approach in which approximate RFs are completely generated in a very efficient way by fixed-point digital operators. The VLSI design of our general purpose RF hardware generator is discussed in detail, showing that it can be integrated in a wider neural system with little effort. Many RF generators (up to 100) can be integrated on a single chip giving rise to a computational system which is two orders of magnitude faster than classical look-up table implementations. The RF generator architecture has been used to implement the forward step of a radial basis function neural network in a single chip for a real world sensor application.

Also, due to the FPGA reconfigurability, new structures and training patterns can be used to update this MES, in order to fit in more pulmonary or other diseases, with minimal effort.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/4493/12740/00593722.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of artificial neural networks: an application on medical expert systems","doi":"10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of artificial neural networks: an application on medical expert systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4923381","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of artificial neural networks: an application on medical expert systems","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"00593722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059987S","chronDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"12740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4493","citationCount":"14","articleId":"593722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":593723,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Training of NOVAS is achieved by simply presenting a set of tolerable objects to the network in a single sweep. NOVAS works with single and with multichannel image representations. The processing principle of NOVAS is closely related to nearest neighbor and hypersphere classifier approaches. We have designed an ASIC for the efficient implementation of the nearest neighbor search. Based on that ASIC we will present an architecture of a modular massively parallel computer suited to meet the real-time constraints of manufacturing processes. Further we will report on the status of a prototype system which is close to completion.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/4493/12740/00593731.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMNN.1994.593731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=593731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massively parallel VLSI-implementation of a dedicated neural network for anomaly detection in automated visual quality control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image representation","Nearest neighbor searches","Application specific integrated circuits","Neural networks","Industrial control","Quality control","Filtering","Inspection","Object detection","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","dedicated neural network","anomaly detection","automated visual quality control","industrial quality control","NOVAS","inspection image filtering","isomorphic image representation","tolerable objects","multichannel image representations","ASIC","nearest neighbor search","modular massively parallel computer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/593731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Massively parallel VLSI-implementation of a dedicated neural network for anomaly detection in automated visual quality control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917030","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massively parallel VLSI-implementation of a dedicated neural network for anomaly detection in automated visual quality control","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"00593731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054867S","chronDate":"26-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"12740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4493","citationCount":"2","articleId":"593731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":593734,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The authors have architected a programmable ultrasound processing system, Programmable Ultrasound Image Processor (PUIP), to facilitate engineering and clinical ultrasound innovations. Multiple high-performance multimedia processors were used to provide a computing power of 4 billion operations per second. Flexibility was achieved by making the system programmable and multimodal, e.g., B-mode, color flow, cine and Doppler data can be processed. They have successfully designed and implemented the PUIP to fit within an ultrasound machine. It provides a platform for rapid testing of new concepts in ultrasound processing and enables software upgrades for future technologies. Current and future clinical applications include extended fields of view, quantitative measurements, three-dimensional ultrasound reconstruction and visualization, adaptive persistence, speckle reduction, edge enhancement, image segmentation, and motion analysis. The PUIP is a significant step in the evolution of ultrasound machines toward more flexible and generalized systems bridging the gap between many innovative ideas and their clinical use in ultrasound machines.","doi":"10.1109/4233.594021","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/12996/00594021.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4233.594021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","startPage":"19","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable ultrasound imaging using multimedia technologies: a next-generation ultrasound machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","displayDocTitle":"Programmable ultrasound imaging using multimedia technologies: a next-generation ultrasound machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594021/","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5632599","pubMedId":"11020807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable ultrasound imaging using multimedia technologies: a next-generation ultrasound machine","sourcePdf":"00594021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069662S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"28","articleId":"594021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":594023,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The circuit is downloaded into the emulation system which emulates the faulty circuit's behavior by synthesizing from the good circuit and the given fault list in a novel way. Fault injection is made easy by shifting the content of a fault injection chain, with which we get rid of the highly time-consuming bit-stream regeneration process. Experimental results for ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits show that the fault emulator is about twenty times faster than HOPE (parallel fault simulator). A parallel fault emulation approach is also proposed, in which faults that are not activated or with short propagation distance are screened off before fault emulation, and non-stem faults are collapsed into their equivalent stem faults, further reducing the number of faults actually emulated.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4494/12838/00594168.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"348 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.594168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.594168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based hardware emulator for fast fault emulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Emulation","Circuit faults","Circuit simulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit synthesis","Logic design","Programmable logic arrays","Table lookup","Sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fault diagnosis","logic testing","sequential circuits","circuit analysis computing","parallel processing","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based hardware emulator","fast fault emulation","fault simulation","sequential circuits","fault injection chain","parallel fault emulation","stem faults","fault list"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based hardware emulator for fast fault emulation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5602459","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based hardware emulator for fast fault emulation","confLoc":"Ames, IA, USA","sourcePdf":"00594168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030623S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494","citationCount":"2","articleId":"594168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":594182,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The feasibility of the paradigm is demonstrated by the first genetic router for Manhattan model channels which contain cyclic vertical constraints. The router has been implemented as a self contained genetic algorithm system. It creates an initial population without violations of constraints using the results of a new theory of locally optimal breaking of cyclic vertical constraints. The population size is problem instance dependent to provide for the preservation of the structural diversity which is built into the initial population. A new encoding scheme and novel crossover and mutation operators are introduced. Convergence rates to optimal solutions are excellent.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.594182","startPage":"393","endPage":"396 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4494/12838/00594182.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1996.594182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for VLSI channel routing in the presence of cyclic vertical constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Very large scale integration","Routing","Constraint theory","Circuits","Wiring","Stochastic processes","Corporate acquisitions","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","network routing","integrated circuit layout","genetic algorithms","circuit optimisation","constraint theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","VLSI channel routing","cyclic vertical constraints","stochastic search","Manhattan model","crossover operator","encoding","mutation operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for VLSI channel routing in the presence of cyclic vertical constraints","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5602470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for VLSI channel routing in the presence of cyclic vertical constraints","confLoc":"Ames, IA, USA","sourcePdf":"00594182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032182S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1996","isNumber":"12838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494","citationCount":"1","articleId":"594182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":594204,"authors":[{"name":"Q.J.

In this paper, we present a first approach of the iterative decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) product codes: \"Turbo codes RS\". Two methods to construct RS product codes are given. The iterative decoding of the RS product codes is based on the soft decoding and the soft decision of the component codes. The performance of RS turbo codes have been evaluated on the Gaussian and Rayleigh channels using Monte Carlo simulation. Coding gains up to 5.5 dB for a BER (bit error rate) of 10/sup -5/ have been obtained on the Gaussian channel. This new coding scheme is very attractive for data storage applications where the RS product codes are often used.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594345.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"125 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Reed-Solomon block turbo code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Reed-Solomon block turbo code","isConference":true,"volume":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5677871","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Reed-Solomon block turbo code","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030877S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"29","articleId":"594345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":594357,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The general requirement for ATM in the context of B-ISDN is to accommodate on the same network, the varying bandwidth needs of future video, voice and data services. In establishing a call or connection, the quality of service on the source-to-destination path of already existing connections within the network, has to be evaluated and found not to violate an agreed contract. This evaluation of the end-to-end performance along a complete virtual path (VP), before deciding whether to reject or accept the call is both slow and difficult to achieve, especially for inhomogeneous variable bit rate sources. If the statistically time independent characteristics of the new and existing connections are known, then a more direct and preventive access control can be exerted on individual cell streams at the nodal switching points. An efficient access control has to be adaptive and fast (short delay), in order to cope well with the high bit rate traffic expected in ATM networks. We have trained the probabilistic random access memory neural network to learn the stochastic arrival pattern of cells at an ATM switching node during a given time slot. This knowledge is then applied to achieve adaptive access control of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594360","startPage":"201","endPage":"205 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594360.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive access control of ATM traffic using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Access control","Communication system traffic control","Neural networks","Asynchronous transfer mode","Bit rate","Context-aware services","B-ISDN","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic","B-ISDN","neural nets","probability","stochastic processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive control","random-access storage","buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive access control","ATM traffic","RAM","VBR sources","ATM network","B-ISDN","bandwidth","data services","voice services","video services","quality of service","end to end performance","virtual path","inhomogeneous variable bit rate sources","statistically time independent characteristics","cell streams","nodal switching points","high bit rate traffic","probabilistic random access memory neural network","stochastic arrival pattern","ATM switching node","homogeneous sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive access control of ATM traffic using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","accessionNumber":"5677885","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive access control of ATM traffic using neural networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035141S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"2","articleId":"594360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":594366,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lin I","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Lin I","id":"37282841300"},{"name":"S.

We propose a network control strategy that accounts for channel loading, interference, and soft handoff in making the rate assignment and QOS decisions. Our algorithms, called load and interference based demand assignment (LIDA), enable the dynamic, packet-like demand-assigned access of MC-CDMA with load and interference based control in a cellular environment. It protects voice (and other high priority or delay sensitive) isochronous users, but accommodates peak rate access by high data rate users when the load on the channel permits. Thus the sharing of the channel between voice users and high data rate services is possible without the potentially very high voice outage probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load and interference based demand assignment (LIDA) for integrated services in CDMA wireless systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594366","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594366.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"241 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Load and interference based demand assignment (LIDA) for integrated services in CDMA wireless systems","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5677891","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load and interference based demand assignment (LIDA) for integrated services in CDMA wireless systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055666S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"10","articleId":"594366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":594372,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result, the scheme imposes no additional communication overhead, while the added complexity at the switches and end-systems is minimal. Our approach complements the ABR rate-based flow control and leads to economically efficient utilization of network resources. According to the scheme, a connection is charged based on the sum of the price per unit of bandwidth on all links along its route. Prices depend on the demand for bandwidth and are adjusted in a decentralized and iterative manner. Simulation results show that prices converge reasonably fast and do not have a negative effect on the convergence properties of flow control.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594441","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594441.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"648 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of pricing and flow control for available bit rate services in ATM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594441/","displayDocTitle":"Integration of pricing and flow control for available bit rate services in ATM networks","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683888","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of pricing and flow control for available bit rate services in ATM networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063357S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"30","articleId":"594441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":594452,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

Multicarrier transmission, in particular OFDM, and a single-carrier system with equalization, often proposed as techniques for overcoming these limitations, present practical difficulties which can restrict their application. In a wireless LAN/ATM application, the desire to transmit short packets requires fast start-up, so the potentially long time required to train an equalizer could limit its usefulness. On the other hand, while OFDM requires very little training, it is burdened with a large peak-to-average power ratio which requires the use of highly linear amplifiers. In this paper, we describe a new approach to OFDM where subchannels are clustered into several smaller blocks and transmitted over separate (ideally, independent) antennas. A single receive antenna is used to demodulate the entire OFDM signal. This approach reduces the peak-to-average power ratio, minimizes the receiver training required, and increases the effectiveness of coding across frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594452","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594452.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"707 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered OFDM with transmitter diversity and coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594452/","displayDocTitle":"Clustered OFDM with transmitter diversity and coding","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683899","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered OFDM with transmitter diversity and coding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049351S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"84","articleId":"594452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594454,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For both modulation formats a carrier frequency offset results in a rotation and an attenuation of the transmitted symbols. In addition, this impairment gives rise to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and destroys the orthogonality between the carriers of the multi carrier signal which yields inter-carrier interference (ICI). The analysis shows that for SC transmission the BER degradation is dominated by the reduction of the useful signal component, provided that the carrier frequency offset is small with respect to the SC symbol rate. For OFDM transmission, a comparison of the different interferences reveals that the BER degradation is determined by the ICI.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594455","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594455.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"723 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of carrier frequency offset on the performance of band limited single carrier and OFDM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594455/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of carrier frequency offset on the performance of band limited single carrier and OFDM signals","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683902","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of carrier frequency offset on the performance of band limited single carrier and OFDM signals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035153S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"26","articleId":"594455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594456,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.H.

The simultaneous transmission creates a severe artificial multipath propagation, which translates into intersymbol interference (ISI). The extra large symbol duration needed in SFN to prevent ISI has raised doubts concerning the performance at high carrier frequencies and high mobile receiver speed. Normally the receiver in an SFN is experiencing a diversity gain of receiving several signals. However, if the received signals are exposed to different carrier offsets and Doppler spread it will lead to interchannel interference (ICI), resulting into performance degradation. A method to analyse the performance including ISI and ICI is presented. The increased outage probability caused by the presence of frequency offsets at the transmitter sites and Doppler spread is then evaluated. Furthermore, the frequency offset and time synchronisation errors at the receiver is also investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of carrier frequency offset, Doppler spread and time synchronisation errors in OFDM based single frequency networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594457","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594457.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"733 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Impact of carrier frequency offset, Doppler spread and time synchronisation errors in OFDM based single frequency networks","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683904","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of carrier frequency offset, Doppler spread and time synchronisation errors in OFDM based single frequency networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042337S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"11","articleId":"594457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594458,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, they exhibit strong envelope fluctuations, which is considered to be an important drawback over many single-carrier schemes, since the inherently high peak-to-mean envelope power ratio leads to heavy power amplification requirements. We present a new approach to the performance evaluation of OFDM transmission with nonlinear power amplification. This approach can be employed for both conventional, single-branch, amplification and two-branch combining amplification, whenever a high number of subcarriers is assumed, and relies on the decomposition of the power amplified signals into uncorrelated \"useful\" and \"self-interference\" components. A simple analytical method is presented for evaluating BER performances, within the proposed approach, for a selected OFDM/QAM multichannel system. The analytical results are in good agreement with simulation results and allow simple optimization of the operating points for the power amplification within the system, as well as simple comparisons of the several amplification schemes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594458","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594458.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"739 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of OFDM transmission with conventional and two-branch combining power amplification schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594458/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of OFDM transmission with conventional and two-branch combining power amplification schemes","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683905","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of OFDM transmission with conventional and two-branch combining power amplification schemes","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046583S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"19","articleId":"594458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":594459,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.J. van Nee","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories, Nieuwegein, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.D.J.","lastName":"van Nee","id":"37347315800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3336-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"594459","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":139,"citationCountPatent":46,"totalDownloads":716},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Error correction codes","Fading","OFDM modulation","Voltage","Modulation coding","Kernel","Transmitters","Power amplifiers","Asynchronous transfer mode"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","error correction codes","mobile radio","multipath channels","fading","decoding","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak to average power reduction","error correction","OFDM codes","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","large data rates","wireless fading channels","transmitter power amplifier efficiency","complementary codes","code set sizes","minimum distance properties","code length","simulation results","Wireless ATM Network Demonstrator","European ACTS program","decoding","QAM"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising way to provide large data rates at reasonable complexity in wireless fading channels. However, a major disadvantage of OFDM is its large peak-to-average power ratio, which significantly decreases the efficiency of the transmitter power amplifier and hence forms a major obstacle to implementing OFDM in portable communication systems. This paper shows the possibility of using complementary codes for both decreasing the peak-to-average power (PAP) ratio and error correction. Set sizes and minimum distance properties of these codes are derived. It is shown that specific subsets of complementary codes have a minimum distance of up to half the code length, while their PAP ratio is only 3 dB. Simulation results demonstrate the viability of using these codes in multipath fading channels. It is currently planned to implement OFDM with complementary codes in the Wireless ATM Network Demonstrator (WAND), a joint European ACTS program.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594459","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12830/00594459.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.594459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12830","startPage":"740","endPage":"744 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM codes for peak-to-average power reduction and error correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM codes for peak-to-average power reduction and error correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594459/","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683906","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM codes for peak-to-average power reduction and error correction","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00594459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02911S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"139","articleId":"594459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594467,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

It shows that an ordinary test generator for single stuck-at faults can be used to perform arbitrary transformations in a combinational circuit and discusses how this approach relates to conventional multilevel minimization techniques based on Boolean division. Furthermore, effective heuristics are presented to decide what network manipulations are promising for minimizing the circuit. By identifying indirect implications between signals in the circuit, transformations can be derived which are \"good\" candidates for the minimization of the circuit. A main advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates directly on the structural netlist description of the circuit so that the technical consequences of the performed transformations can be evaluated in an easy way, permitting better control of the optimization process with respect to the specific goals of the designer. Therefore, the presented technique can serve as a basis for optimization techniques targeting nonconventional design goals. This paper only considers area minimization, and our experimental results show that the method presented is competitive with conventional technology-independent minimization techniques. For many benchmark circuits, our tool, the Hannover implication tool, based on learning (HANNIBAL) achieves the best minimization results published to date. Furthermore, the optimization approach presented is shown to be useful in formal verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5631318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Logic optimization and equivalence checking by implication analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic optimization and equivalence checking by implication analysis","sourcePdf":"00594832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050612S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"13009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"33","articleId":"594832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":594834,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose new techniques for alleviating the problems caused by coupling between signal lines on integrated circuits. We show that models used by previous work on coupled noise-constrained layout synthesis do not allow the use of several important degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom include the ability to utilize dynamic noise margins rather than static noise margins, the dependence of coupled noise on drive strength, and the possibility of using overlaps to reduce susceptibility to noise. We derive an expression for the coupled noise integral and a bound for the peak coupled noise voltage which shows order of magnitude improvements in both accuracy and fidelity compared to the charge sharing model used in previous work. We use the new bounds to guide a greedy channel router, which manipulates exact adjacency information at every stage, allowing it to introduce jogs or doglegs when necessary for coupled noise reduction. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm compares favorably to previous work. The coupled noise is significantly reduced on benchmark instances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","publicationDate":"March 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5631320","volume":"16","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk reduction for VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk reduction for VLSI","sourcePdf":"00594834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041043S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"13009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"182","articleId":"594834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594837,"authors":[{"name":"Shiuann-Shiuh Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shiuann-Shiuh Lin","id":"37067208000"},{"name":"Yuh-Ju Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuh-Ju Lin","id":"37857608500"},{"name":"TingTing Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"TingTing Hwang","id":"37270857000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"594837","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Emulation","Intelligent networks","Integrated circuit interconnections","Partitioning algorithms","Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Engines","Computer architecture","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiterminal networks","multiprocessor interconnection networks","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["net assignment problem","FPGA-based logic emulation system","folded-Clos network interconnection","partial crossbar interconnection structure","multiterminal nets","field programmable gate arrays","time-efficient heuristic method","exact solver"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the net assignment problem for a logic emulation system in the folded-Clos network interconnection, also referred to as the \"partial crossbar interconnection structure\". Net assignment of two-terminal nets in this interconnection structure is guaranteed to be completed in polynomial time. However, net assignment of multiterminal nets becomes NP-complete. A previous paper by Butts et al. (1992) has proposed a simple heuristic to perform net assignment for multiterminal nets. Its results showed that it failed to complete routing of all nets for many cases. It is inadequate to have a net assignment algorithm which does not guarantee an exact solution, as the failure of interconnecting field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) will result in the failure of mapping to the computing engine as a whole and will result in redoing the previous steps, e.g., partitioning of circuits. Therefore, we propose an exact algorithm to solve the net assignment problem. The exact algorithm will find a solution if one exists. However, the exact algorithm may take exponential time. Accordingly, a two-phase approach is taken in this paper. A time-efficient heuristic method is used first. The exact solver will be called only if the heuristic fails to deliver a solution.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/13009/00594837.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Net assignment for the FPGA-based logic emulation system in the folded-Clos network structure","doi":"10.1109/43.594837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.594837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Net assignment for the FPGA-based logic emulation system in the folded-Clos network structure","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5631323","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Net assignment for the FPGA-based logic emulation system in the folded-Clos network structure","sourcePdf":"00594837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042953S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"13009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","articleId":"594837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594842,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

ATM has the inherent ability to provide a common basis for transmission and switching functionality in both local and wide area networks. With the potential to support all services available today as well as those envisaged for the future, ATM holds a strong promise for network operators and end customers. To fully exploit this potential, ATM switch architectures are required which provide versatility and modularity in supporting services and protocols, independent scalability of data throughput and control performance over a wide range, and also reliability features adaptable to the respective application scenario. This paper describes in some detail how the MainStreetXpress core services node, which has evolved from the prototype described by Fischer et. al.

End-to-end performance guarantees depend on connections complying with traffic contracts as their cells travel through the network. This paper presents a leaky-bucket shaper architecture that scales to a large number of connections with diverse burstiness and bandwidth parameters. In contrast to existing designs, the proposed architecture arbitrates fairly between connections with conforming cells by carefully integrating leaky-bucket traffic shaping with rate-based scheduling algorithms. Through a careful combination of per-connection queueing and approximate sorting, the shaper performs a small, bounded number of operations in response to each arrival and departure, independent of the number of connections and cells. When the shaper must handle a wide range of rate parameters, a hierarchical arbitration scheme can reduce the implementation overheads and further limit interference between competing connections. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the architecture limits cell-shaping delay and traffic distortions, even in periods of heavy congestion. The efficient combination of traffic shaping and link scheduling results in an effective architecture for managing buffer and bandwidth resources in large, high-speed ATM switches.","doi":"10.1109/49.594854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/13010/00594854.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.594854","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594854/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable architectures for integrated traffic shaping and link scheduling in high-speed ATM switches","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5624627","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable architectures for integrated traffic shaping and link scheduling in high-speed ATM switches","sourcePdf":"00594854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055215S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","articleId":"594854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":594858,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This has the advantage of isolating the PML from the rest of the FDTD computation, but, unlike the split step formulation, requires almost no additional computational resources.","doi":"10.1109/75.594858","startPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/13011/00594858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.594858","endPage":"186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsplit step 3-D PML for use with the FDTD method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"An unsplit step 3-D PML for use with the FDTD method","volume":"7","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5627536","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsplit step 3-D PML for use with the FDTD method","sourcePdf":"00594858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026192S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"91","articleId":"594858","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":594861,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

In this paper, an adaptive heart-noise reduction method, based on fourth-order statistics (FOS) of the recorded signal, without requiring recorded \"noise-only\" reference signal, is presented. This algorithm uses adaptive filtering to preserve the entire spectrum. Furthermore, the proposed filter is independent of Gaussian uncorrelated noise and insensitive to the step-size parameter. It converges fast with small excess errors and, due to the narrowband nature of heart noise (HN), it requires a very small number of taps.

In this paper, we propose a WATM LAN which incorporates the CDMA spread spectrum technique together with hybrid ARQ error control schemes to effectively combat multi-path effects. We present a TDMA based multiple access protocol to arbitrate access of ATM cells from mobile terminals into time-slots on multiple CDMA channels. The multiple access protocol can efficiently support a mixture of real-time, delay-sensitive services and loss-sensitive, data services.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.594981","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13032/00594981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.594981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13032","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1206 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC protocol for a CDMA based wireless ATM LAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MAC protocol for a CDMA based wireless ATM LAN","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594981/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC protocol for a CDMA based wireless ATM LAN","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00594981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035937S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"5","articleId":"594981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":594985,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Hee Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Hee Lee","id":"38184400300"},{"name":"Jong-Tae Park","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Tae Park","id":"37281010900"},{"name":"Jae-Young Ahn","affiliation":["Ground System Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Young Ahn","id":"37403231000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3925-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"594985","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Satellite broadcasting","Artificial satellites","Architecture","Protocols","Carbon capture and storage","Electronic mail","Wireless communication","B-ISDN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile satellite communication","network topology","protocols","telecommunication signalling","personal communication networks","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network architecture","integration","CDMA systems","IRIDIUM","Clearing House gateway","signaling protocol translation","mechanisms","parameter matching","signaling procedures","location registration","call setup","integrated network","terrestrial cellular network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a network architecture for the integration of IRIDIUM and CDMA systems is proposed.

However, it requires excessively long execution time to estimate lower BER. Although this time can substantially be reduced by using importance sampling (IS), IS has not been quite successful in the simulation of practical nonlinear satellite communication systems that typically consist of memory components and forward error correction (FEC) scheme. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the simulation of Viterbi decoder using sequentially implemented IS. We then combine it with the efficient importance sampling (EIS) technique to resolve the problems associated with memory. Results from this integration exhibit dramatic reduction of simulation time. Principles of the new simulation method of Viterbi decoding are presented.

The motivation behind access control is to schedule data packet transmissions when voice activity is low and curtail data transmissions when the voice load is heavy. In this work, a simple and flexible real-time access control scheme proposed in previous work, is extended. The performance measures used are the probability of outage and delay for data. It is shown how the system can support more users with access control than without, for a given probability of outage. The penalty lies in introducing delay for the data users. Performance of the control schemes is analyzed for different parameters and tradeoffs involved in their choice are discussed. It is demonstrated that with appropriate choice of parameters, the proposed real-time control scheme approaches the performance of optimum prediction schemes, in terms of the tradeoff between capacity and delay.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.594995","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13032/00594995.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1275 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.594995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access control of data in integrated voice/data CDMA systems: benefits and tradeoffs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=594995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/594995/","displayDocTitle":"Access control of data in integrated voice/data CDMA systems: benefits and tradeoffs","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793912","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access control of data in integrated voice/data CDMA systems: benefits and tradeoffs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00594995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041325S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"9","articleId":"594995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":595007,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The architecture has three features. First, it uses a bit clock as an operating clock rather than a symbol clock. Second, the recursive Berlekamp algorithm (RBA) is adopted to calculate an error locator polynomial.

Finally, a shifter structure is suggested in order to solve the routing area problem which might be caused incidentally in recursive architectures.

For most equalization schemes, channel estimation is required. However, fast start-up channel estimation is needed to ensure quick equalizer convergence. As result, there has been much interest in finding fast channel estimation techniques which are based on non-iterative channel sounding methods. To obtain the best estimation performance, certain optimal sequences are required. Generally, it is difficult to construct optimal sequences with binary symbols because the optimal sequence length grows very rapidly as the channel impulse response length increases. In this paper, we propose a sequence construction method for sounding sequences consisting of complex symbols with constant amplitude and multiple phases. The advantage of using complex symbols is that an optimal sequence can always be constructed with a minimum sequence length. Our construction method generates new complex optimal sequences which are aperiodic in addition to the periodic sequences previously known.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.595035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13032","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13032/00595035.pdf","endPage":"1487 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-phase optimal sequences for fast initialization of channel estimation and equalization","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.595035","startPage":"1484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multi-phase optimal sequences for fast initialization of channel estimation and equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595035/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5793952","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-phase optimal sequences for fast initialization of channel estimation and equalization","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00595035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027659S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","articleId":"595035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":595038,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The spacing of individual feedforward taps of the DFE is made variable such that, when the channel consists of sparsely-distributed multipath with a large delay spread (e.g., \"hilly terrain\" delay profiles), the feedforward taps can be sparsely assigned to increase the equalizer span without increasing the total number of the feedforward taps. We provide an analysis of the optimum tap assignment problem and propose a practical channel-estimation-based tap assignment algorithm which can be executed prior to equalizer training. Simulation results are obtained for various outdoor delay profiles with dispersions ranging up to several tens of symbol periods and while using only a small number of feedforward taps (e.g., 5 taps), compared to a conventional contiguous-tap DFE, the proposed tap-selectable DFE is found to give relatively stable performance (measured in terms of required SNR) over all profiles, and also to provide improved robustness to fast fading.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.595043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13032/00595043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.595043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13032","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1526 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tap-selectable decision feedback equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tap-selectable decision feedback equalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595043/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tap-selectable decision feedback equalization","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00595043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035868S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"10","articleId":"595043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":595062,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Ning Wu","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"lastName":"Zi-Ning Wu","id":"37087170994"},{"name":"J.M.

Lee has also concluded in general that the frequency reuse factor has to be 7 for an 18 db C/I requirement when the path-loss exponent /spl gamma/=4. A simulator was built to do an exact C/I analysis. From the analysis, it can be seen that the C/I satisfaction percentage varies with frequency reuse factor K and path-loss exponent /spl gamma/. This is a characteristic in designing a cellular system. Specifically, for 94% C/I satisfaction percentage, we only need K=3 for sectorized cells. Also, we can see that the first interfering tier is the most dominating in the interference contribution. We give a conservative approximation of the ratio of 2nd and 3rd tier to 1st tier interference for uniformly distributed mobiles in the reverse link.

One filter has been fabricated from a lithium tantalate (LiTaO/sub 3/) substrate, and one from a quartz substrate. The filter on LiTaO/sub 3/ fulfills all requirements dealing with spectrum shaping. However, the temperature range is not as wide as with quartz substrates due to the higher temperature coefficient of LiTaO/sub 3/. The filter on quartz is very stable from the temperature coefficient point of view, but the insertion attenuation and spurious electromagnetic feedthrough are relatively high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb. 1997","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5697399","displayDocTitle":"A SAW shaping filter for high data rate MSK-encoding in a broadband DS-CDMA system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SAW shaping filter for high data rate MSK-encoding in a broadband DS-CDMA system","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00595128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168568S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb. 1997","isNumber":"13022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4641","citationCount":"1","articleId":"595128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":595260,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This is appropriate for numerous applications that emphasize navigating through a virtual space. However, a large class of problems exists for which navigation is not the critical issue. Rather, these applications demand a fine-granularity visualization and interaction with virtual objects and scenes. This applies to a host of other applications typically performed on a desktop, table or workbench. Responsive Workbench technology offers a new way to develop virtual environments for this rather sizable class of applications. The Responsive Workbench operates by projecting a computer-generated, stereoscopic image off a mirror and through a table surface. Using stereoscopic shuttered glasses, users observe a 3D image displayed above the tabletop. By tracking the group leader's head and hand movements, the Responsive Workbench permits changing the view angle and interacting with the 3D scene. Other group members observe the scene as the group leader manipulates it, facilitating communication among observers. Typical methods for interacting with virtual objects on the workbench include speech recognition, gesture recognition and a simulated laser pointer (stylus). This article features Responsive Workbench applications from four institutions that have pioneered this technology. The four applications are: visualization, situational awareness, collaborative production modeling and planning, and a virtual windtunnel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595260/","volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5638119","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applications of the Responsive Workbench","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of the Responsive Workbench","sourcePdf":"00595260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033267S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"12","articleId":"595260","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":595266,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We have been developing a workspace called Visage to address both types of analysis tasks. Our goal is for expert users to move easily between routine tasks and exploratory data analysis as situations demand. Furthermore, recognizing the inherent complexity of data analysis, we want a system that is accessible to occasional users yet simultaneously provides power and flexibility for expert users. Ideally, such a system should support a gradual shift to increasing expertise so that occasional users of routine interfaces can perform more detailed analyses if needed. Visage addresses these needs by providing a consistent interface to a wide variety of data manipulation and visualization primitives. Plus, it lets users combine these operations to create appliances-special-purpose applications capturing multiple steps of a routine data analysis process-in a single, simple interface. Analysts thus benefit from a common set of operations and ways to integrate information across applications. Visage provides both basic tools and specialized information appliances to help them.","doi":"10.1109/38.595266","startPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/13035/00595266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.595266","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information appliances and tools in Visage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Information appliances and tools in Visage","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5638122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information appliances and tools in Visage","sourcePdf":"00595266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102408S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"16","articleId":"595266","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":595268,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.T.

Several visual exploration techniques have been proposed for 2D information layouts. Many of these try to take advantage of humans' natural visual pattern-recognition abilities to understand global relationships while simultaneously integrating this knowledge with local details. This desire for detail-in-context views (also called fisheye, multiscale and distortion views) has fueled considerable research in the development of distortion viewing tools. Generally, these tools provide space for magnification of local detail by compressing the rest of the image. In considering a possible detail-in-context view for 3D layouts, we first examine 2D distortion techniques, bearing in mind the particular 3D problem of occlusion. Comparing 2D and 3D information layout adjustment tools leads directly to a 3D visual access tool that clears a line of sight to any region of interest. While our technique can extend to any type of 3D information display, we focus on graphs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5638123","volume":"17","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extending distortion viewing from 2D to 3D","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending distortion viewing from 2D to 3D","sourcePdf":"00595268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069412S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"73","articleId":"595268","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":595269,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The development of algorithms able to organize video information according to semantic content of the data is getting more and more important. This will allow algorithms such as indexing and retrieval to work more efficiently. Until now, an attempt to extract semantic information has been performed using only video information. As a video sequence is constructed from a 2-D projection of a 3-D scene, video processing has shown its limitations especially in solving problems such as object identification or object tracking, reducing the ability to extract semantic characteristics. A possibility to overcome the problem is to use additional information. The associated audio signal is then the most natural way to obtain this information. This paper presents a technique which combines video and audio information together for classification and indexing purposes. The classification is performed on the audio signal; a general framework that uses the results of such classification is then proposed for organizing video information.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595320","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","startPage":"2597","endPage":"2600 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio as a support to scene change detection and characterization of video sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Audio as a support to scene change detection and characterization of video sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595320/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738395","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio as a support to scene change detection and characterization of video sequences","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059796S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"36","articleId":"595320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":595323,"authors":[{"name":"W.

We present a new estimation segmentation procedure using the an iterative method called iterative conditional estimation (ICE).

For the estimation step we use a maximum likelihood estimation for the noise model parameters and the least square method proposed by Derin et al. (1987) to estimate the MRF prior model. Then, in order to obtain a good segmentation and to speed up the convergence rate, we use a multigrid strategy with the previously estimated parameters. This technique has been successfully applied to real sonar images and is compatible with an automatic treatment of massive amounts of data.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595366","startPage":"2781","endPage":"2784 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595366.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Markovian segmentation of sonar images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595366/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Markovian segmentation of sonar images","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5744668","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Markovian segmentation of sonar images","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030953S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"18","articleId":"595366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":595378,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["Information Technology Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Ning Li","id":"37087218712"},{"name":"T.

This is realized by leaving out rows and columns from the images, and skipping whole frames at the transmitter. To get the best possible quality image sequence at the receiver side, the skipped portion of the video should be reconstructed using advanced motion-compensated (MC) postprocessing techniques. Our paper mainly focuses on the restoration/generation of unknown frames of the sequence at time instances, where the original scene has not been sampled, or which were skipped from the original sequence in the transmitter. This enhancement of the temporal resolution is performed using our advanced MC interpolation algorithm, utilizing an accelerated motion model and motion-based segmentation with proper handling of covered and uncovered areas.

For both methods, bandwidth reduction is achieved by mapping from a higher dimensional source space to a lower dimensional channel space. In the first system, a source vector is quantized and mapped to a discrete set of points in a multidimensional PAM signal constellation. In the second system the source vector is approximated with a point in a continuous subset of the source space. This operation is followed by mapping the resulting vector to the channel space by a one-to-one continuous mapping resulting in continuous amplitude channel symbols. The proposed methods are evaluated for a memoryless Gaussian source with an additive white Gaussian noise channel, and offer significant gains over previously reported methods. Specifically, in the case of two-dimensional source vectors, and one-dimensional channel vectors, the gap to the optimum performance theoretically attainable is less than 1.0 dB for a wide range of channel signal-to-noise ratios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Space technology","AWGN","Constellation diagram","Signal to noise ratio","Constraint optimization","Gaussian noise","Demodulation","Additive white noise","Signal mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth compression","vector quantisation","source coding","pulse amplitude modulation","memoryless systems","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous amplitude channels","bandwidth compression","vector approximation","continuous subset","source signal space","power constraint","bandwidth reduction","vector quantisation","multidimensional PAM signal constellation","source vector","one-to-one continuous mapping","memoryless Gaussian source","additive white Gaussian noise channel","two-dimensional source vectors","one-dimensional channel vectors","optimum performance theoretically attainable","signal-to-noise ratio","AWGN channel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595446","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595446.pdf","startPage":"3093","endPage":"3096 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth compression for continuous amplitude channels based on vector approximation to a continuous subset of the source signal space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth compression for continuous amplitude channels based on vector approximation to a continuous subset of the source signal space","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595446/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5744745","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth compression for continuous amplitude channels based on vector approximation to a continuous subset of the source signal space","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034073S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"43","articleId":"595446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":595447,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiaolin Wu","id":"37281235500"},{"name":"Jian-huo Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jian-huo Chen","id":"37616309300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"595447","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context modeling","Entropy coding","Wavelet coefficients","Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Quantization","Wavelet domain","Image reconstruction","Computer science","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","data compression","entropy codes","redundancy","transform coding","adaptive codes","wavelet transforms","quadtrees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context modeling","entropy coding","wavelet coefficients","image compression","symbol streams","EZW image coder","embedded image coding","zerotrees","statistical redundancy","coding efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the problem of context modeling and entropy coding of the symbol streams generated by the well-known EZW image coder (embedded image coding using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients).

The approximation is based on superpositions of translated Gaussians. The method used enables us to give explicit approximations and error bounds. New connections between this problem and sampling theory are exposed, but the method used departs radically from those commonly used to obtain sampling results since (i) it applies to signals that are not band-limited, and possibly even discontinuous; (ii) the sampling knots (the centers of the radial-basis functions) need not be equidistant; (iii) the basic approximation building block is the Gaussian, not the usual sinc kernel. The results given offer an answer to the following problem: how complex should a neural network be in order to be able to approximate a given signal to better than a certain prescribed accuracy? The results show that O(1/N) accuracy is possible with a network of N basis functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595472","startPage":"3197","endPage":"3200 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595472.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and approximation by superposition of Gaussians","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Gaussian approximation","Sampling methods","Kernel","Nonuniform sampling","Telecommunications","Interpolation","Adaptive equalizers","Spread spectrum communication","Discrete transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","approximation theory","feedforward neural nets","statistical analysis","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial-basis-function neural networks","translated Gaussian superposition","nonlinear approximation problem","data approximation","error bounds","discontinuous signals","sampling knots","radial-basis function centers","neural network complexity","signal approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and approximation by superposition of Gaussians","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5744771","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and approximation by superposition of Gaussians","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061162S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"5","articleId":"595472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":595477,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Min Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Jong-Min Park","id":"37087146769"},{"name":"Yu-Hen Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Hen Hu","id":"37087142555"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"595477","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern classification","Sampling methods","Pattern recognition","Stochastic processes","Convergence","Drives","Learning systems","Costs","Monte Carlo methods","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive on-line learning","pattern classification","active sampling","optimal decision boundary","Markov chain model","decision boundary","training samples","stochastic oracle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595477","abstract":"An adaptive on-line learning method is presented to facilitate pattern classification using active sampling to identify optimal decision boundary for a stochastic oracle with minimum number of training samples.

It is based on non-uniform segment models, which are learned and scored with a time bidirectional recurrent neural network. While usually neural networks in speech recognition systems are used to estimate posterior \"frame to phoneme\" probabilities, they are used here to estimate directly \"segment to phoneme\" probabilities, which results in an improved duration model. The special MAP approach allows not only incorporation of long term dependencies on the acoustic side, but also on the phone (output) side, which results automatically in parameter efficient context dependent models. While the use of neural networks as frame or phoneme classifiers always results in discriminative training for the acoustic information, the MAP approach presented also incorporates discriminative training for the internally learned phoneme language model. Classification tests for the TIMIT phoneme database gave promising results of 77.75 (82.38)% for the full test data set with all 61(39) symbols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595486/","accessionNumber":"5744784","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic model building based on non-uniform segments and bidirectional recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic model building based on non-uniform segments and bidirectional recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041516S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"595486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":595491,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tan Lee","id":"37277269500"},{"name":"P.C.

Since Cantonese is a monosyllabic and tonal language, the recognition system consists of a tone recognizer and a base syllable recognizer. The tone recognizer adopts the architecture of a multi-layer perceptron in which each output neuron represents a particular tone. The syllable recognizer contains a large number of independently trained recurrent networks, each representing a designated Cantonese syllable. Such a modular structure provides greater flexibility to expand the system vocabulary progressively by adding new syllable models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a speaker-dependent recognition system has been built with the vocabulary growing from 40 syllables to 200 syllables. In the case of 200 syllables, a top-1 recognition accuracy of 81.8% has been attained and the top-3 accuracy is 95.2%.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595491.pdf","startPage":"3269","endPage":"3272 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based speech recognition system for isolated Cantonese syllables","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Speech recognition","Natural languages","Hidden Markov models","Vocabulary","Design engineering","Electronic mail","Multilayer perceptrons","Neurons","Loudspeakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","multilayer perceptrons","recurrent neural nets","natural languages","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","speech recognition system","isolated Cantonese syllables","tonal language","monosyllabic language","tone recognizer","base syllable recognizer","multi-layer perceptron","independently trained recurrent networks","modular structure","speaker-dependent recognition system","vocabulary expansion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based speech recognition system for isolated Cantonese syllables","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5744789","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based speech recognition system for isolated Cantonese syllables","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037977S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"4","articleId":"595491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":595493,"authors":[{"name":"Ha-Jin Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, KAIST, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ha-Jin Yu","id":"37088020184"},{"name":"Yung-Hwan Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, KAIST, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yung-Hwan Oh","id":"37087167854"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"595493","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":31},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Vocabulary","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Detectors","Training data","Computer science","Speech analysis","Parallel processing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","neural nets","Hebbian learning","speech processing","pattern classification","modules","acoustic signal processing","acoustic signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic subword units","word spotting","neural network model","nonuniform unit","speaker independent continuous speech recognition","input speech segmentation","pronunciation variations","recognition unit","phonemes","coarticulation effects","unit classifier module","word detector module","training data","TIMIT speech data","vocabulary","supervised Hebbian learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595493","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595493.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"3277","endPage":"3280 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network for 500 vocabulary word spotting using acoustic sub-word units","abstract":"A neural network model based on a non-uniform unit for speaker-independent continuous speech recognition is proposed.

To improve the overall system performance, some schemes apply different coding algorithms to separate parts of an image according to the content of this subimage. Such schemes are referred to as dynamic coding schemes. Applying the best suited coding algorithm to a part of an image will lead to an improved coding quality, but implies an algorithm selection phase. Current selection methods require the computation of the reconstructed image after coding and decoding with all the selected algorithms in order to choose the best method. Some other schemes use ways of pruning the search in the algorithm space. Both approaches suffer from a heavy computational load. Furthermore, the computational complexity is increased even more if the parameters have to be adjusted for a given algorithm during the search. This paper describes a way to predict the coding quality of a region of the input image for any given coding method. The system will then be able to select the best suited coding algorithm for each region according to the predicted quality. This prediction scheme has low complexity, and also enables the adjustment of algorithm specific parameters during the search.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595527","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13015/00595527.pdf","startPage":"3413","endPage":"3416 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.595527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based image coding quality prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based image coding quality prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5744825","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based image coding quality prediction","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00595527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049986S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"595527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":595570,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Shan Lee","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Lin-Shan Lee","id":"37271904300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"595570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595570","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Computer networks","Computer peripherals","Application software","Costs","Microcomputers","Speech","Context modeling","Error correction","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","dictation","natural languages","reviews","speech processing","acoustic signal processing","linguistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mandarin Chinese","voice dictation","Chinese language","Chinese characters","very large vocabulary","speech recognition","Mandarin dictation","acoustic modeling/processing","linguistic modeling/processing"]}],"abstract":"The Chinese language is not alphabetic, and input of Chinese characters into computers remains a difficult problem even after decades of efforts made to overcome the problem.

The characteristics of Mandarin Chinese, significantly different from those of most alphabetic western languages, lead to the fact that many special measures and unique approaches that consider the feature structure of the language are believed to be the key to providing better solutions to the problem. Such special measures and unique approaches are the primary focus of this article. We analyze the characteristic structure of Mandarin Chinese and discuss related issues.

Of concern is connective fault tolerance, which is defined as the ability to maintain communication between any two fault-free processors in the presence of faulty processors, buses, or processor-bus links. We introduce a model called processor-bus-link (PBL) graphs to represent a multiple-bus system's interconnection structure. The model is more general than previously proposed models, and has the advantages of simple representation, broad application, and the ability to model partial bus failures. The PBL graph implies a set of component adjacency graphs that highlights various connectivity features of the system. Using these graphs, we propose a method for analyzing the maximum number of faults a multiple-bus system can tolerate, and for identifying every minimum set of faulty components that disconnects the processors of the system. We also analyze the connective fault tolerance of several proposed multiple-bus systems to illustrate the application of our method.","doi":"10.1109/71.595574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"574","endPage":"586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/13059/00595574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.595574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connective fault tolerance in multiple bus systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Fault diagnosis","Multiprocessing systems","Fault tolerance","Hardware","Costs","Bandwidth","Degradation","Sun","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","reliability","multiprocessor interconnection networks","graph theory","hypercube networks","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connective fault tolerance","multiple bus systems","multiprocessor systems","multiple shared buses","interprocessor communication","fault-free processors","faulty processors","processor-bus-link graphs","interconnection structure","partial bus failures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Connective fault tolerance in multiple bus systems","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5634772","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595574/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connective fault tolerance in multiple bus systems","sourcePdf":"00595574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047387S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"6","articleId":"595574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":595579,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37278086600"},{"name":"Cong Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Cong Fu","id":"37350611600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"595579","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristic algorithms for scheduling iterative task computations on distributed memory machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Distributed computing","Parallel processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Concurrent computing","Pipeline processing","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic programming","processor scheduling","distributed memory systems","pipeline processing","directed graphs","resource allocation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic algorithms","iterative task computations","distributed memory machines","partitioned scientific programs","iterative executions","distributed memory architectures","nonzero communication overhead","software pipelining","graph unfolding","directed acyclic graph scheduling","load balancing","communication optimization","granularity","iterative task graphs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595579","abstract":"Many partitioned scientific programs can be modeled as iterative executions of computational tasks and represented by iterative task graphs (ITGs).

Accesses to such a mutual exclusion lock may create heavy synchronization traffic and/or serious contention over the network, thereby degrading system performance considerably. In this paper, we introduce an efficient scheme which keeps synchronization traffic low and avoids serious hot-spot contention. This is made possible by constructing a circular list of the processors waiting for the critical section and by dispersing accesses to the lock. Extensive simulation of the proposed approach was conducted and the lower bound on the elapsed time was derived.

We analyze the performance of RAID5 with distributed sparing in normal mode, degraded mode, and rebuild mode in an OLTP environment, which implies small reads and writes. The analysis in normal mode uses an M/G/1 queuing model, which takes into account the components of disk service time. In degraded mode, a low-cost approximate method is developed to estimate the mean response time of fork-join requests resulting from accesses to recreate lost data on the failed disk. Rebuild mode performance is analyzed by considering an M/G/1 vacationing server model with multiple vacations of different types to take into account differences in processing requirements for reading the first and subsequent tracks. An iterative solution method is used to estimate the mean response time of disk requests, as well as the time to read each disk, which is shown to be quite accurate through validation against simulation results. We next compare RAID5 performance in a system (1) without a cache; (2) with a cache; and (3) with a nonvolatile storage (NVS) cache. The last configuration, in addition to improved read response time due to cache hits, provides a fast-write capability, such that dirty blocks can be destaged asynchronously and at a lower priority than read requests, resulting in an improvement in read response time. The small write penalty is also reduced due to the possibility of repeated writes to dirty blocks in the cache and by taking advantage of disk geometry to efficiently destage multiple blocks at a time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/13059/00595583.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.595583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.595583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAID5 performance with distributed sparing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Delay","Queueing analysis","Bandwidth","Performance analysis","Cache storage","Fault tolerance","Automatic control","Iterative methods","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage management","fault tolerant computing","file servers","magnetic disc storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAID5 disk arrays","distributed sparing","dedicated sparing system","vacationing server model","degraded mode","normal mode","rebuild mode","preemptive priority queuing","OLTP environment","M/G/1 queuing model","low-cost approximate method","mean response time","fork-join requests","iterative solution method","nonpreemptive priority queuing","nonvolatile storage","read response time","fast-write capability","write penalty","dedicated sparing","disk failures","fault-tolerance","small-write syndrome","disk cache"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"RAID5 performance with distributed sparing","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5641849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAID5 performance with distributed sparing","sourcePdf":"00595583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062596S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"70","articleId":"595583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":595718,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The issues of guiding test pattern generation for a realistic gate-level fault model, and of introducing new strategies for testability enhancement, at layout level, are addressed. Experiments on standard cell digital designs show the gate-level, realistic bridging faults should be used as target faults for test preparation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that bridging faults involving fanout nodes exhibit a dominant effect on testability. Finally, it is shown that routing with testability constraints is rewarding, and that routing channels should be carefully designed for hard fault avoidance. To produce such results, a new set of tools has been developed, and is presented here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct 1993","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4966259","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experiments on bridging fault analysis and layout-level DFT for CMOS designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments on bridging fault analysis and layout-level DFT for CMOS designs","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00595718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053047S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct 1993","isNumber":"13033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4647","citationCount":"9","articleId":"595718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":595735,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

The model uses a binary response for when a chip does or does not have bit failures recorded. Once a model is fit to the bit fail data, accurate yield loss estimates can be made of certain bit fail modes taking into account the amount of autocorrelation of bit fail categories on similar chips. This is necessary due to the high degree of bit fail clustering typically encountered in semiconductor manufacturing. Examples are given showing the actual versus the predicted model on a 128 kbit SRAM device.

Among the main characteristics of credit card traffic are the great imbalance between proper and fraudulent operations, and a great degree of mixing between both. To ensure proper model construction, a nonlinear version of Fisher's discriminant analysis, which adequately separates a good proportion of fraudulent operations away from other closer to normal traffic, has been used. The system is fully operational and currently handles more than 12 million operations per year with very satisfactory results.","doi":"10.1109/72.595879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13042/00595879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.595879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13042","startPage":"827","endPage":"834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural fraud detection in credit card operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural fraud detection in credit card operations","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5627273","pubMedId":"18255686","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural fraud detection in credit card operations","sourcePdf":"00595879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087856S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"124","articleId":"595879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":595881,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper describes a load forecasting system known as ANNSTLF (artificial neural-network short-term load forecaster) which has received wide acceptance by the electric utility industry and presently is being used by 32 utilities across the USA and Canada. ANNSTLF can consider the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the load. Besides its load forecasting engine, ANNSTLF contains forecasters that can generate the hourly temperature and relative humidity forecasts needed by the system. ANNSTLF is based on a multiple ANN strategy that captures various trends in the data. Both the first and the second generation of the load forecasting engine are discussed and compared. The building block of the forecasters is a multilayer perceptron trained with the error backpropagation learning rule. An adaptive scheme is employed to adjust the ANN weights during online forecasting. The forecasting models are site independent and only the number of hidden layer nodes of ANN's need to be adjusted for a new database.

These revenue estimates are critically important since agency budgets, support for education, and improvements to infrastructure all depend on their accuracy. Underforecasting generates windfalls that concern taxpayers, whereas overforecasting produces budget shortfalls that cause inadequately funded commitments. The pattern finding ability of neural networks gives insightful and alternative views of the seasonal and cyclical components commonly found in economic time series data. Two applications of neural networks to revenue forecasting clearly demonstrate how these models complement traditional time series techniques. In the first, preoccupation with a potential downturn in the economy distracts analysis based on traditional time series methods so that it overlooks an emerging new phenomenon in the data. In this case, neural networks identify the new pattern that then allows modification of the time series models and finally gives more accurate forecasts. In the second application, data structure found by traditional statistical tools allows analysts to provide neural networks with important information that the networks then use to create more accurate models. In summary, for the Utah revenue outlook, the insights that result from a portfolio of forecasts that includes neural networks exceeds the understanding generated from strictly statistical forecasting techniques. In this case, the synergy clearly results in the whole of the portfolio of forecasts being more accurate than the sum of the individual parts.","doi":"10.1109/72.595884","startPage":"863","endPage":"873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.595884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13042/00595884.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and traditional time series methods: a synergistic combination in state economic forecasts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595884/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and traditional time series methods: a synergistic combination in state economic forecasts","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5627277","pubMedId":"18255690","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and traditional time series methods: a synergistic combination in state economic forecasts","sourcePdf":"00595884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086545S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"94","articleId":"595884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":595885,"authors":[{"name":"Sungzoon Cho","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

This paper reports a case study of neural-network modeling techniques developed for the EMERALD system. The resulting neural network is currently in the prototype testing phase at Nortel. Neural-network models can be used to identify fault-prone modules for extra attention early in development, and thus reduce the risk of operational problems with those modules. We modeled a subset of modules representing over seven million lines of code from a very large telecommunications software system. The set consisted of those modules reused with changes from the previous release. The dependent variable was membership in the class of fault-prone modules. The independent variables were principal components of nine measures of software design attributes. We compared the neural-network model with a nonparametric discriminant model and found the neural-network model had better predictive accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5627279","pubMedId":"18255693","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to software quality modeling of a very large telecommunications system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to software quality modeling of a very large telecommunications system","sourcePdf":"00595888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024885S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"124","articleId":"595888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":595890,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It uses image processing algorithms, neural nets and Bayesian classifiers. As the particles are amorphous and different greatly, there were complex nonlinear decisions and anomalies. The process is in two stages; isolation of particles, and classification of each particle. The isolation process correctly identifies 96.9% of the objects as complete and single particles after a 15.5% rejection of questionable objects. The sample set had a possible 2455 particles taken from 384 256/spl times/256-pixel images. Of the 15.5%, 14.2% were correctly rejected. With no rejection the accuracy drops to 91.8% which represents the accuracy of the isolation process alone. The isolated particles are classified by shape, single crystal protrusions, texture, crystal size, and agglomeration. The particle samples were preclassified by a human expert and the data were used to train the five classifiers to embody the expert knowledge. The system was designed to be used as a research tool to determine and study relationships between particle properties and plant parameters in the production of smelting grade alumina by the Bayer process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595890/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5627281","pubMedId":"18255695","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of aluminum hydroxide particles from the Bayer process using neural network and Bayesian classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of aluminum hydroxide particles from the Bayer process using neural network and Bayesian classifiers","sourcePdf":"00595890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037495S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"4","articleId":"595890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":595893,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.K.

After extensive training of the network, the FastProp with hyperbolic tangent was recommended, Input patterns were decomposed to facilitate the training process and eliminate the effect of local minima. Both the test and forecast results indicated that the FKNNS is an excellent aid for machine maintenance planning since there are too much difficulties in deriving the analytical solution otherwise.

The first set of results showed poor performance for the neural networks in assessing the dynamic security. However a number of corrective measures improved the results significantly. These corrective measures included: 1) the effectiveness of output; 2) the number of outputs; 3) the type of features (static versus dynamic); 4) the number of features; 5) system partitioning; and 6) the ratio of training samples to features.

Cork stoppers are used to seal wine bottles, Cork stopper quality classification is a practical pattern classification problem. The cork stoppers are grouped into eight classes according to the degree of defects on the cork surface. These defects appear in the form of random-shaped holes, cracks, and others. As a result, the classification cork stopper is not a simple object recognition problem. This is because the pattern features are not specifically defined to a particular shape or size. Thus, a complex classification form is involved, Furthermore, there is a need to build a standard quality control system in order to reduce the classification problems in the cork stopper industry. The solution requires factory automation meeting low time and reduced cost requirements. This paper describes a cork stopper quality classification system using morphological filtering and contour extraction and following (CEF) as the feature extraction method, and a fuzzy-neural network as a classifier. This approach will be used on a daily basis.

As a result, the nonlinearities inherent in most types of suspensions have a significant impact on performance. Specifically, it may be difficult to design a linear controller which gives satisfactory performance, stability, and disturbance rejection over a wide range of operating points. One way to address this problem is through the use of nonlinear control techniques such as feedback linearization. For most common designs of magnetic suspensions the governing equations are in the so-called companion form, lending themselves to feedback linearization. A single degree of freedom magnetic suspension has been designed and constructed in order to compare the performance of linear and nonlinear digital control schemes in a well-controlled experimental environment. We demonstrate the superiority of nonlinear controllers over conventional controllers for systems with large variations in operating point via experiments on our system.","doi":"10.1109/87.595924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"427","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.595924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13044","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/13044/00595924.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Magnetic levitation","Feedback","Performance gain","Suspensions","Nonlinear control systems","Force control","Digital control","Bandwidth","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic levitation","sampled data systems","digital control","feedback","nonlinear control systems","linearisation techniques","electric current control","compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearizing control","magnetic suspension systems","nonlinearities","linear controller","stability","disturbance rejection","nonlinear control techniques","feedback linearization","nonlinear digital control","linear digital control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linearizing control of magnetic suspension systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595924/","volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5628489","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearizing control of magnetic suspension systems","sourcePdf":"00595924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036815S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"193","articleId":"595924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":595925,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It also describes the use of this method in a process gain adaptive generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm. Neural networks are well known for their ability to memorize nonlinear functions after being trained. They are often trained to represent process dynamics (or the inverse of the process dynamics) directly. This method, however, uses neural networks to learn the parameter updating process of a standard RLS algorithm and then to relate the parameters so obtained to the operating conditions of the nonlinear processes. This permits RLS to be extended to nonlinear applications. It combines the advantages of the simplicity and speed of convergence of RLS algorithms with the ability of neural networks to learn any complex nonlinear function to any desired accuracy. Experimental results when using this method to control an air-handling plant are reported and show the great potential of this algorithm in controlling nonlinear processes in which the parameters are linear but are functions of static inputs.","doi":"10.1109/87.595925","startPage":"439","endPage":"445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.595925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/13044/00595925.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a neural-network-based RLS algorithm in the generalized predictive control of a nonlinear air-handling plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/595925/","displayDocTitle":"Application of a neural-network-based RLS algorithm in the generalized predictive control of a nonlinear air-handling plant","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5628490","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a neural-network-based RLS algorithm in the generalized predictive control of a nonlinear air-handling plant","sourcePdf":"00595925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032417S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"11","articleId":"595925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":595926,"authors":[{"name":"Weng Khuen Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Weng Khuen Ho","id":"37087262507"},{"name":"Chang Chieh Hang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Chang Chieh Hang","id":"37087150315"},{"name":"Junhong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Junhong Zhou","id":"37087697253"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"595926","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":887},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Tuning","Error correction","Proportional control","Frequency","Pi control","Robust control","Automatic testing","Adaptive control","Robust stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-term control","step response","robust control","self-adjusting systems","adaptive control","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-tuning PID control","phase margins","gain margins","proportional-integral-derivative controller","under-damped step response","second-order plus dead time plant","hinged rectangular plate","angular deflection","air stream","variable speed fan"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=595926","abstract":"The effectiveness of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for plants with under-damped step response is not well understood.

The demand for greater precision coupled with the increased use of lightweight materials necessitates the inclusion of elastic dynamics in the control strategy.

The standard form of adaptive control does not appear to be applicable, since the basic assumptions on the system dynamics and nonlinear characteristics are rarely satisfied.

A software package written in ACSL, allowing easy handling of the models and data of the HGS components, is presented. A special feature of the proposed model is that an auxiliary fictitious source is introduced in order to obtain the power electric balance at the busbars during the simulation stage, as well as in the case of ill-sized components. The observed unbalanced powers are then used to update the system design. As a case of study, the simulation program is applied to evaluate the energetic performance of a power plant relative to a small isolated community, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, in order to establish the potential improvement achievable via an optimal integration of renewable energy sources in conventional plants. Evaluations and comparison among different sized wind, photovoltaic and diesel groups as well as of different management strategies have been performed using the simulation package and are reported and discussed aiming to present the track followed to select the final design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid power systems","Power system modeling","Fuels","Energy resources","Software packages","Power generation","Renewable energy resources","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system CAD","power system analysis computing","electric power generation","energy resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid generation systems","logistical model","performance evaluations","software package","power electric balance","busbars","ill-sized components","computer simulation","isolated community","renewable energy sources","conventional energy resources","management strategies","simulation package"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.1997.596040","startPage":"177","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference.

The first is based on the use of mixtures of language models: the training text is partitioned according to topic, a language model is constructed for each component and, at recognition time, appropriate weightings are assigned to each component to model the observed style of language. The second technique is based on augmenting the standard trigram model with a cache component in which the words' recurrence probabilities decay exponentially over time. Both techniques yield a significant reduction in perplexity over the baseline trigram language model when faced with a multi-domain test text, the mixture-based model giving a 24% reduction and the cache-based model giving a 14% reduction.

Our target is to get speaker-dependent training and recognition to perform well with a very small amount of training data in the case of mismatch between the training and testing environments. We take advantage of the fact that speakers tend to preserve their speaking style in similar situations (e.g. when speaking to a machine) and our main means to reach the target is to force similar state segmentations in the training and recognition phases. We show that with the proposed method we can substantially improve the robustness of a speech recognizer and decrease the error rates by over 93% when compared with a standard approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5723395","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Noise robust speech recognition with state duration constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise robust speech recognition with state duration constraints","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075643S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"9","articleId":"596074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596075,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Experimental results are described for ATIS and SwitchBoard tasks. About 8% relative reduction in word error is obtained for ATIS.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596077.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"886 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Word-based confidence measures as a guide for stack search in speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Word-based confidence measures as a guide for stack search in speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5723398","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Word-based confidence measures as a guide for stack search in speech recognition","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028209S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"21","articleId":"596077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":596078,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Once a structure of the model is given, the model's parameters are obtained automatically by feeding training data. There is, however, no effective design method leading to an optimal structure of the HMMs. We propose a new application of a genetic algorithm to search out such an optimal structure. In this method, the left-right structures are adopted for HMMs and the likelihood is used for the fitness of the genetic algorithm. We report the results of our experiment showing the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in automatic speech recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596099","startPage":"967","endPage":"970 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596099.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolated word recognition using the HMM structure selected by the genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Genetic algorithms","Automatic speech recognition","Speech recognition","Parameter estimation","Training data","Genetic engineering","Power engineering and energy","Biological cells","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","hidden Markov models","parameter estimation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","isolated word recognition","HMM structure","automatic speech recognition","hidden Markov models","parameter estimation","performance","model parameters","training data","design method","optimal structure","left-right structures","experiment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Isolated word recognition using the HMM structure selected by the genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5723418","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated word recognition using the HMM structure selected by the genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Munich","sourcePdf":"00596099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051036S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"3","articleId":"596099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":596110,"authors":[{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Li Deng","id":"37271500200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"596110","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Natural languages","Target recognition","Speech processing","Computational modeling","Speech enhancement","Physics computing","Training data","Heart","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","speech processing","natural languages","speech synthesis","feature extraction","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated multilingual speech recognition","universal phonological features","speech production model","cross-language portability","overlapping features","American English","Mandarin/Cantonese","Chinese","Canadian French","dynamic modeling","acoustic domain","hidden production-affiliated variables","task-dynamic model","speech production","recognition algorithms","training algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596110","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596110.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1010 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated-multilingual speech recognition using universal phonological features in a functional speech production model","abstract":"An outline and general design of an integrated-multilingual speech recognizer is presented, focusing on its key novelty of cross-language portability.

Then, the transformed HMM parameters are globally smoothed via the MAP adaptation. Within the MAP adaptation, the parameters of unseen units in adaptation data are further adapted by employing the transfer vector interpolation scheme.

In SAT, speaker characteristics are modeled explicitly as linear transformations of the SI acoustic parameters. The effect of inter-speaker variability in the training data is reduced, leading to parsimonious acoustic models that represent more accurately the phonetically relevant information of the speech signal. The proposed training method is applied to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus that consists of multiple training speakers.

To this end, we learn two sets of parameters to unmix the mixtures and to estimate the true density function. The solutions are discussed for feedback and feedforward architectures. Since the quality of separation depends on the modeling of the underlying density we propose different methods to closer approximate the density function using some contest. The proposed density estimation achieves separation of a wider class of sources. Furthermore, we employ the FIR polynomial matrix techniques in the frequency domain to invert a true-phase mixing system. The significance of the new method is demonstrated with the successful separation of two speakers and separation of music and speech recorded with two microphones in a reverberating room.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596159","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596159.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596159","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1202 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A contextual blind separation of delayed and convolved sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A contextual blind separation of delayed and convolved sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596159/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730425","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contextual blind separation of delayed and convolved sources","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025962S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"25","articleId":"596159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596165,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The general idea is to divide up the full frequency band (represented in terms of critical bands) into several subbands, compute phone probabilities for each subband on the basis of subband acoustic features, perform dynamic programming independently for each band, and merge the subband recognizers (recombining the respective, possibly weighted, scores) at some segmental level corresponding to temporal anchor points. The results presented in this paper confirm some preliminary tests reported earlier. On both isolated word and continuous speech tasks, it is indeed shown that even using quite simple recombination strategies, this subband ASR approach can yield at least comparable performance on clean speech while providing better robustness in the case of narrowband noise.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596172.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1254 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband-based speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Subband-based speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730438","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband-based speech recognition","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037409S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"33","articleId":"596172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596173,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For spectral representation a set of multi-resolution cepstral features are proposed. Cepstral features obtained from a DCT of the log energy-spectrum over the full voice-bandwidth (100-4000 Hz) are combined with higher resolution features obtained from the DCT of upper subband (say 100-2100) and lower subband (2100-4000) halves. This approach can be extended to several levels of different resolutions. For representation of the temporal structure of speech segments or phonetic units, the conventional cepstral and dynamic cepstral features representing speech at the sub-phonetic levels, are supplemented by a set of phonetic features that describe the trajectory of speech over the duration of a phonetic unit. A conditional probability model for phonetic and sub-phonetic features is considered.

Although many existing speech recognition systems do not weight both kinds of features, it seems convenient to use some weighting in order to increase the recognition accuracy of the system. In the cases that this weighting is performed, it is manually tuned or it consists simply in compensating the variances. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to automatically estimate an optimum state-dependent stream weighting in a continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) recognition system by means of a maximum-likelihood based training algorithm. Unlike other works, it is shown that simple constraints on the new weighting parameters permit to apply the maximum-likelihood criterion to this problem. Experimental results in speaker independent digit recognition show an important increase of recognition accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596176.pdf","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1270 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood weighting of dynamic speech features for CDHMM speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Maximum likelihood estimation","Automatic speech recognition","State estimation","Error analysis","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood estimation","feature extraction","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood weighting","dynamic speech features","CDHMM","speech recognition","recognition accuracy","optimum state-dependent stream weighting","continuous density hidden Markov model","maximum-likelihood based training algorithm","weighting parameters","speaker independent digit recognition","HMM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood weighting of dynamic speech features for CDHMM speech recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730442","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood weighting of dynamic speech features for CDHMM speech recognition","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048556S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"22","articleId":"596176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":596192,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For the datasets currently in use, the best classifier classifies with 5.8% error on a frame-by-frame basis, and 1.4% error when integrating long (2.4 second) segments of sound.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction and evaluation of a robust multifeature speech/music discriminator","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596192","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596192.pdf","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1334 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Construction and evaluation of a robust multifeature speech/music discriminator","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5723466","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction and evaluation of a robust multifeature speech/music discriminator","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02797S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"316","articleId":"596192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":596194,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Le Vu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary"],"lastName":"Hai Le Vu","id":"37087205266"},{"name":"Laszlo Lois","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary"],"lastName":"Laszlo Lois","id":"37087736011"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"596194","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Filters","Frequency","Linear predictive coding","Principal component analysis","Speech analysis","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Quantization","Encoding","Speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","transforms","transform coding","spectral analysis","correlation methods","neural nets","speech processing","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transformation","LSP parameters","neural network","intraframe correlation properties","line spectrum pair","efficient encoding algorithm","Karhunen-Loeve transformation","nonuniform statistical characteristics","transform vectors","system training","principal component analysis network","decorrelation","distortion","speech analysis-synthesis","speech coding","low bit rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596194","abstract":"The intraframe correlation properties of line spectrum pair (LSP) are used to develop an efficient encoding algorithm using the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transformation.

In cases where there is not enough acoustic data available to allow for thorough estimation of HMM parameters it is impossible to train an appropriate model. The basic idea to overcome this problem is to create a task independent seed model that can cope with all tasks equally well. However, the performance of such a generalist model is of course lower than the performance of task dependent models (if these were available). So, the seed model is gradually enhanced by using its own recognition results for incremental online task adaptation. Here, we use a multilingual romanic/germanic seed model for a slavic target task. In tests on Slovene digits multilingual modeling yields the best recognition accuracy compared to other language dependent models. Applying unsupervised online task adaptation we observe a remarkable boost of recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596222","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13030/00596222.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.596222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13030","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1454 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-service adaptation of multilingual hidden-Markov-models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"In-service adaptation of multilingual hidden-Markov-models","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596222/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-service adaptation of multilingual hidden-Markov-models","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00596222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053496S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"13","articleId":"596222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596237,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Taking advantage of the directional inhomogeneity of mobile radio channels, the application of smart antenna concepts in cellular mobile radio is expected to increase the admissible number of users and to decrease both the cluster order, i.e. the number of cells per cluster, and the transmission powers. Three different approaches to smart antenna concepts applying receiver antenna diversity at the uplink receiver with different antenna configurations are investigated for a time-slotted CDMA mobile radio system termed joint detection CDMA (JD-CDMA). In order to quantify the obtainable performance improvements, the spectral efficiency, which measures the information rate per unit bandwidth and per cell, is considered. The paper describes a method to determine said spectral efficiency by means of simulations. This method is applied to the uplink of a JD-CDMA mobile radio system explicitly taking the three aforementioned smart antenna concepts into account.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The data have been obtained during the processing of a frequency profile database, stored during a broadband indoor measurement campaign in the 1.7-2.2 GHz band. The measurement has been carried on in a way, such that experimental sequences of signal to interference ratio, at the DECT frequency (1.89 GHz), have been able to be calculated. The sequences have been quantized, by comparison with a prefixed set of thresholds. The number of thresholds has been adopted equal to one or two. Statistical tests on obtained sequences seem to show that they can be generally modeled, as arising from a first order Markov chain, without dependence on chosen threshold values. Results obtained with two thresholds do exhibit less significance, due to the small amount of data.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.596322","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

It is applied to estimate the interfering signal components in a received signal in order to cancel them to improve the detection performance. It is shown, that especially for bad signal-to-noise ratios, the optimum device, which delivers a soft value for feedback, improves the quality of interference elimination compared to the standard two point characteristic (sign-function=hard feedback). The performance enhancement using the optimum device is investigated in two possible applications: interference cancellation for CDMA signals and decision feedback equalization for signals in frequency selective channels. A considerable gain is achieved in the first case whereas in the latter case it is only marginal.

The receiver employs a recursive-least-squares (RLS) multipath MMSE filter-bank as the front-end to mitigate the multiple-access interference and the multipath interference. Two suboptimal schemes for joint channel estimation and symbol detection are developed, namely, the decision-directed symbol-by-symbol detection and the per-survivor sequence detection. A differentially coherent detection scheme is also considered. Finally, the performance of these adaptive detectors are assessed by simulations. A salient feature of the adaptive receivers proposed is that their implementations can be mapped to VLSI systolic arrays to exploit massively parallel signal processing computation.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

These algorithms are based on the zero forcing (ZF) criterion and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, respectively. Basically, they consist of a channel equalizer followed by a code-matched filter. They allow to exploit the multipath diversity of the mobile radio channel. Only the CDMA code used for transmission to the mobile station of interest is needed at the receiver and only the data symbols addressed to that individual mobile station are detected. The computational complexity is independent of the number of active users, which allows to provide mobile terminals of small size and weight with low power consumption. The algorithms are applied to the downlink of a TDMA/CDMA system concept. The algorithms specially designed for the downlink situation lead to a significant system performance enhancement as compared with the conventional matched filter or Rake receiver and to a slightly worse system performance than ZF- and MMSE-based joint detection algorithms which are applicable also in the uplink and which require that all CDMA codes presently used for transmission to the active mobile stations are known at each of these mobile stations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

An orthogonalizing matched filter (OMF) is one of the effective linear interference cancellers. OMF employs the constrained minimum mean square (CMMS) criteria for controlling the combining coefficients, and operates as the decorrelator, or the orthogonalizing filter, under the interference dominant condition and as the matched filter in the noise dominant condition. The new blind algorithm evaluates a steering vector which is essential for achieving good cancelling performance. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the received signal correlation matrix constitutes a time-varying code vector space, and the steering vector embedded in that space is obtained and utilized. The effectiveness of the blind method is verified by computer simulations under non-fading and fading environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

A series of experimental studies using a smart antenna system to exploit spatial diversity in terrestrial communications have been reported previously. However, using a smart antenna system and SDMA in the satellite-Earth propagation channel is another interesting topic for wireless communication. Estimates of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a satellite signal, studies of the variation of the spatial signature with frequencies, satellite location and motion, and diversity gain achieved by using an antenna array in both line-of-sight and shadowing scenarios are presented in this paper. For a typical environment of both line-of-sight (LOS) and shadowing cases, the experimental results show rich spatial diversity and diversity gain when using a smart antenna in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite mobile and personal communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The challenges arising from the complex time-variant ISL network topology are tackled by a discrete-time network model and routing procedure. The approach is based on the combination of a modified standard routing scheme and the ATM VPC concept. The routing scheme works completely off-line, i.e. prior to system operation. In a first step, a virtual topology is set up for all successive time intervals, providing instantaneous sets of alternative VPCs (paths) between all source-destination satellite pairs. In the second step, path sequences over a series of time intervals are chosen from that according to a certain optimization procedure. Two different optimization procedures are discussed in detail, and a numerical performance evaluation is presented for telephony service in an example ISL network (Iridium). The overall routing performance is evaluated in terms of remaining delay jitter due to inevitable path handover. The results show that optimized routing strategies are specifically capable of minimizing severe delay jitter, and thus in turn reduce the complexity of ATM based operation in a connection-oriented service environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596357/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5760205","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimized routing in LEO intersatellite link networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimized routing in LEO intersatellite link networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00596357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02671S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1997","isNumber":"13063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664","citationCount":"18","articleId":"596357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":596366,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We obtain closed-form solutions for NMF channel capacity (with and without diversity) for each power and rate adaptation strategy, and compare them with the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel capacity. The capacity of a NMF channel is always smaller than the capacity of an AWGN channel. Moreover, the capacities converge to the AWGN channel capacity as the Nakagami fading parameter m tends to infinity, as expected. Our results also show that optimal power and rate adaptation yields a small increase in capacity over just optimal rate adaptation with constant power, and this small increase in capacity diminishes as the average received carrier-to-noise ratio, m parameter, and/or number of diversity branches increase. Finally, fixed rate transmission with channel inversion suffers the largest capacity penalty. However, this penalty diminishes as the amount of fading decreases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13063","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

A synchronized TDMA-FDMA system is used within cells and an asynchronous CDMA system is used across the cells. The cell signals are spread by unique spreading codes to reduce inter-cell interference. Simulations show that the bit error rate (BER) delivered by the proposed system for a E/sub b//N/sub 0/ greater than a certain value is better than that for conventional cellular TDMA system. This improvement is the direct result of spreading signals used to decrease the inter-cell co-channel interference (CCI). The improvement thus realized can be translated into reduction of cluster size and thus towards capacity improvement.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The effect of both pure multipath and combined multipath/multiuser interference (asynchronous) on the estimation of parameters for an isolated path is described; upper margins for the signal to noise ratio degradation are derived in two settings, namely for packet wavelet and PN/Gold code signatures, respectively. Numerical results are shown for the upper margins. The performance with shift orthogonal envelopes shows an overwhelming improvement over Gold codes, especially when the signature regularity increases. Bandwidth wise, it turns out that packet wavelet signatures are twice as compact as PN codes for a given delay resolution. The major disadvantage of shift-orthogonal waveforms is a nonconstant envelope.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of a CDMA system with user signatures based on packet wavelets in multipath channels","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, myocardial scintigraphy and finally coronary angiography. The diagnostic process is stepwise and the results are interpreted hierarchically, i.e, the next step is necessary only if the results of the former are inconclusive. Because suggestibility is possible, the results of each step are interpreted individually and only the results of the highest step are valid. On the other hand, machine learning methods may be capable of objective interpretation of all available results for the same patient and in this way increase the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of each step. In the usual setting, the machine learning algorithms are tuned to maximize classification accuracy. In our case, the sensitivity and specificity were much more important, so we generalized the algorithms to take in account the variable misclassification costs. The costs can be tuned in order to bias the algorithms towards higher sensitivity or specificity. We conducted many experiments with four learning algorithms and different variations of our dataset (327 patients with completed diagnostic procedures). Our results show that improvements using machine learning techniques are reasonable and might find good use in practice.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.1997.596411","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computer Based Medical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computer Based Medical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4666/13065/00596411.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.1997.596411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of machine learning in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"An application of machine learning in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5623044","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596411/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of machine learning in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease","confLoc":"Maribor, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"00596411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044095S","chronDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666","citationCount":"10","articleId":"596411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":596422,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The data recorded with ground reaction force measurement platforms is a convenient starting point for gait analysis. The authors argue in favor of using the raw data from such force platforms and apply artificial neural networks for gait malfunction identification. They discuss their latest results in this line of research by using a supervised learning rule. The employed classification approach is learning vector quantization which proved to be highly robust in the training process yielding a remarkably high recognition accuracy of gait patterns.","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.1997.596423","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computer Based Medical Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.1997.596423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13065","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computer Based Medical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4666/13065/00596423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clinical gait analysis by neural networks: issues and experiences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596423/","displayDocTitle":"Clinical gait analysis by neural networks: issues and experiences","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5623056","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clinical gait analysis by neural networks: issues and experiences","confLoc":"Maribor, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"00596423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059964S","chronDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666","citationCount":"24","articleId":"596423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":596425,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The image processing environment which is Windows based, encapsulates a multiple-document interface (MDI) and is menu driven. Object (shape) parameter extraction is focused on features that are invariant in terms of translation, rotation and scale transformations. The neural network models incorporated into the environment allow both clustering and classification of objects from the analysed image. Mapping neural networks perform input sensitivity analysis on the extracted feature measurements and thus facilitates the removal of irrelevant features and improvements in the degree of generalisation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596425/","accessionNumber":"5623058","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based integrated image processing environment for object recognition in medical applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based integrated image processing environment for object recognition in medical applications","confLoc":"Maribor, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"00596425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045214S","chronDate":"11-13 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666","citationCount":"1","articleId":"596425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":596528,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Headway control keeps the controlled vehicle an appropriate distance from vehicles directly ahead. Each vehicle needs to have an obstacle detection system installed to monitor distances to the preceding vehicle and its relative speed. In the future, headway control systems for consumer use must be cheap and capable of operating in all environmental conditions. To enable such equipment to be built, a dual mode millimeter-wave radar has been proposed. It would be able to operate in both radar mode, in which it would measure the distance to the leading vehicle, and in communication mode, in which it would exchange data with a vehicle ahead of it. By operating in two modes alternately, the dual mode radar can provide the headway control system with all the data needed to control the distances to the leading vehicles, their speeds, acceleration conditions, and the leading vehicle's steering angle and brake signal. The data can then be used for stable control of the vehicles. This paper describes the concept of the dual mode radar system and the results of the experiments undertaken.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596556","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4660/13055/00596556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13055","startPage":"1261","endPage":"1264 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-wave dual mode radar for headway control in IVHS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave dual mode radar for headway control in IVHS","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596556/","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5679146","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave dual mode radar for headway control in IVHS","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00596556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049236S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"8","articleId":"596556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":596559,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Emphasis has been placed on the capacitor-based pulse forming network (PFN) as the primary means of energy storage and pulse shaping. Defining and understanding the electrical and mechanical performance characteristics of high energy density capacitors is critical for both the PFN designer and overall weapons system engineering. Aerovox Type LM power capacitors (2.4 MJ/m/sup 3/) were evaluated under the projected Navy operating scenarios, including rep-rate and burst modes. The Aerovox Type LM capacitors, first used in the US Army 8.5 MJ Pulsed Power Module in 1991, are known to be nonlinear with respect to capacitance and voltage. Additionally, the charge/discharge efficiency is known to be lower for this capacitor than for other, lower energy density capacitors. The life characteristics of the capacitor have been established under normal operating conditions. This paper discusses the performance of the Aerovox Type LM capacitors in both normal and fault mode conditions. The parameters discussed include temperature variations, voltage reversal and peak current performance. Thermal stability and fault mode performance for the power capacitor is also defined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596572/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5615624","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of high energy density capacitors under projected US Navy ETC gun operating conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of high energy density capacitors under projected US Navy ETC gun operating conditions","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00596572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034096S","chronDate":"3-6 July 1995","isNumber":"13049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656","citationCount":"8","articleId":"596572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":596587,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Already implemented services are high quality speech with fixed or variable data rates as well as high data rate transmissions for video, Internet or other TCP/IP data applications. The high data rates and the flexibility of applications result in new demands for the radio architecture and for key components, like digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters and power amplifiers. This paper provides a system overview describing some applications and a more detailed description of the radio architecture of the wideband testbed. Finally measurements of the data throughput and of the radio channel are shown.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596587","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4660/13055/00596587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13055","startPage":"1387","endPage":"1390 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio architecture of a wideband DS-CDMA testbed for future cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio architecture of a wideband DS-CDMA testbed for future cellular systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596587/","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5679176","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio architecture of a wideband DS-CDMA testbed for future cellular systems","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00596587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031847S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"1","articleId":"596587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":596591,"authors":[{"name":"K.

First, it seeks to model access control policies with anti-symmetry, reflexivity and transitivity exceptions using a lattice, and to propose an information flow security definition for the resulting set of policies (POL). Second, it supports a constructive approach to policy specification through an algebraic structure (POL, AND, OR, NOT, /spl equiv/, /spl les/). This structure is homomorphic to Boolean algebra.

The antenna is shielded with a metallic wall to reduce possible health hazards towards user. Unlike other cellular antennas, new antenna's operating bandwidth spans between the first two resonances of the antenna and an almost 50 ohms flat input resistance can be obtained within a bandwidth of 824-896 MHz, using proper antenna dimensions. A proto-type of the dual resonance shielded antenna has been built and input impedance, near and far field measurements have been performed. Near field measurements showed that excessive electromagnetic radiation towards user is blocked by 90% without significantly sacrificing the omnidirectional characteristics required for cellular phone devices. Input impedance measurements are compared with the numerical results and a good agreement has been achieved. The new antenna uses all copper wires and shield which makes it easy and inexpensive to build.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596857","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4660/13055/00596857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1997.596857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13055","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1754 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of a dual resonance and shielded cellular antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of a dual resonance and shielded cellular antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596857/","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5684497","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of a dual resonance and shielded cellular antenna","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00596857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034996S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"1","articleId":"596857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596861,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main idea is to trade off the available transmission rate between source coding and channel coding in an efficient manner. This coding system is easy to implement and has acceptably low complexity. Furthermore, effectively no degradation due to channel noise can be detected; instead, the penalty paid due to channel noise is a reduction in source coding resolution. Detailed numerical comparisons are given that can serve as benchmarks for comparisons with future encoding schemes.

It consists of: (1) taking fisheye lens images at potential user locations; (2) extracting path state information (clear, shadowed, or blocked) as a function of look angles from the images; and (3) combining each path state for single or multiple satellites in a specific constellation with frequency-appropriate statistical fade models to predict overall performance measures such as fade dependence with elevation angle or path-diversity gain. The advantage of the method is that it minimizes the need for expensive propagation campaigns. The importance of including specular reflections and diffraction under urban blockage conditions is established. From images obtained in urban Japan, a fade-lapse rate with elevation of 0.2 dB/degree is deduced for fades exceeded about 10% of the time. Path-diversity gain for combining and hand-off diversity is found for up to four-fold diversity at a high-, mid-, and low-latitude location for the Globalstar constellation. With two-fold diversity and neglecting implementation losses, the fade margin required for 80% and 95% coverage at mid-latitude urban locations is reduced from 16 to 6 dB and from 25 to 16 dB, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/8.596901","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13069/00596901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.596901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path diversity for LEO satellite-PCS in the urban environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low earth orbit satellites","Diversity reception","Lenses","Data mining","Predictive models","Frequency measurement","Gain measurement","Performance gain","Reflection","Diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","personal communication networks","land mobile radio","diversity reception","fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["specular reflections","LEO satellite PCS","urban environment","radiowave propagation","mobile satellite systems","fisheye lens images","user locations","path state information","look angles","frequency appropriate statistical fade models","performance measures","elevation angle","path diversity gain","specular diffraction","urban blockage conditions","urban Japan","fade lapse rate","hand-off diversity","combining","Globalstar constellation","fade margin","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Path diversity for LEO satellite-PCS in the urban environment","volume":"45","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5640144","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596901/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path diversity for LEO satellite-PCS in the urban environment","sourcePdf":"00596901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020086S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","articleId":"596901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":596902,"authors":[{"name":"Keen-Keong Yan","affiliation":["The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Keen-Keong Yan","id":"37862474300"},{"name":"Yilong Lu","affiliation":["The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yilong Lu","id":"37280557500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"596902","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":300,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2252},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596902","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Antenna arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Vectors","Encoding","Decoding","Phase shifters","Attenuators","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","array signal processing","antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","electrical engineering","electrical engineering computing","linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array pattern synthesis","genetic algorithm","sidelobe reduction","antenna array","geometric configuration","array excitation weighting vectors","complex number chromosomes","decimal linear crossover","chromosome construction","software programming","CPU time reduction","phase constraint","magnitude constraint","complex excitation coefficients","digital phase shifters","digital attenuators","linear arrays","circular arrays"]}],"abstract":"A simple and flexible genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern synthesis of antenna array with arbitrary geometric configuration is presented.

The MR approach is based on using MM to calculate the radiation and scattering patterns of the feed, using physical optics plus uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) to include the reflector, and in addition to include the mutual interaction (multiple reflections) between the reflector and the feed by using the expression for the sum of an infinite geometric series. The MR approach is shown to be equally accurate as a MM solution of the complete antenna with reflector, provided the reflector is in the far field of the feed, and the MR approach is much faster. As a result of the calculations using the MR approach, design curves are presented showing how the G/T varies as a function of antenna geometry, size, and elevation angle, all for a given noise profile of the surrounding sky and ground. The computed radiation patterns and G/Ts are compared with measurements for several elevation angles and surrounding terrain.","doi":"10.1109/8.596904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13069/00596904.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.596904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"G/T maximization of a paraboloidal reflector fed by a dipole-disk antenna with ring by using the multiple-reflection approach and the moment method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"G/T maximization of a paraboloidal reflector fed by a dipole-disk antenna with ring by using the multiple-reflection approach and the moment method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596904/","volume":"45","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5640147","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"G/T maximization of a paraboloidal reflector fed by a dipole-disk antenna with ring by using the multiple-reflection approach and the moment method","sourcePdf":"00596904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032706S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"596904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":596907,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The transmit-receive antenna system is characterized by a set of cascaded operators, which transform the source waveform and power into similar quantities at the receiving antenna terminals. Two such sets are defined. The first one is phrased in terms of the wave-type \"time-dependent effective-height\" operator, while the second one is defined in terms of the energy-type \"gain operator\". Both definitions fit within a complete transmit-receive system description, the latter being equivalent to the frequency-domain Friis equation. However, these operators are derived entirely in the context of the time-domain field equation. The starting point in the time-domain analysis of the effective height is the slant stack transform (SST) of the time-dependent current distribution in a manner equivalent to the spatial Fourier transform used in the frequency domain. The vector autocorrelation of the transmitting effective height is then used to define the time-dependent gain operator under impulsive source excitation. Time-domain reciprocity leads to the definitions of antenna parameters under receiving conditions and the corresponding equivalent circuit. The parameters defined in this way fit within a consistent transmit-receive convolution operator, operating on the autocorrelation of the input signal. This independent time-domain representation is thus similar to the frequency-domain representation. However, unlike the conventional frequency-domain circuit parameters, which relate voltage and current amplitudes, the time-domain circuit representation is based on incident and reflected wave-type constituents. In addition, the use of appropriate norms facilitates the transformation of our operators to stand-alone figures of merits. The general concepts developed are demonstrated for a short dipole antenna.","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13069/00596907.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.596907","doi":"10.1109/8.596907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596907","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Frequency domain analysis","Equations","Fourier transforms","Autocorrelation","Circuits","Antenna theory","Current distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","antenna radiation patterns","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","current distribution","time-domain analysis","transforms","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["figures of merits","antenna characterization","far field transmit receive system","short pulse antennas","transmit receive antenna system","cascaded operators","source waveform","source power","time dependent effective height operator","energy type gain operator","time domain field equation","time domain analysis","slant stack transform","time dependent current distribution","vector autocorrelation","impulsive source excitation","time domain reciprocity","antenna parameters","equivalent circuit","independent time domain representation","short dipole antenna","reflected wave","incident wave"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Antenna characterization in the time domain","accessionNumber":"5640148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","volume":"45","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna characterization in the time domain","sourcePdf":"00596907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036636S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"198","articleId":"596907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":596912,"authors":[{"name":"L.I.

More recently, feedforward neural networks trained on error backpropagation have been widely used to solve a variety of pattern-recognition problems. However, it is arguably unnecessary to learn such a computationally intensive solution when one (i.e., the k-NN rule) is effectively available a priori, especially given the well-known pitfalls of backpropagation. Accordingly, there is some interest in the literature in network implementations of this rule, so as to combine its known, good performance with the speed of a massively parallel realization. In this paper, we present a novel neural-network architecture which implements the k-NN rule and whose distinctive feature relative to earlier work is its synchronous (i.e., clocked) nature. Essentially, it has a layered, feedforward structure but, in its basic form, also incorporates feedback to control sequential selection of the k neighbors. The principal advantages of this new scheme are the avoidance of the stability problems which can arise with alternative asynchronous feedback (lateral-inhibition) circuits, the restriction of analog weights to the first hidden layer and the fact that network design uses noniterative weight calculations rather than iterative backpropagation. Analysis of the network shows that it will converge to the desired solution (faithfully classifying the input pattern according to the k-NN rule) within (2k-1) clock cycles. Apart from minor changes which can be effected externally, the same design serves for any value of k. The space complexity of the \"brute-force\" network implementation is O(N/sup 2/) units, where N is the number of training patterns, and it has O(N/sup 2/d) analog weights where d is the dimensionality of these patterns. Thus, some modifications to reduce the required number of units (and, thereby, weighted connections) are considered. Overall, this paper affords for high-speed, parallel implementations of proven pattern-classification techniques.","doi":"10.1109/81.596943","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/13070/00596943.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.596943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On neural-network implementations of k-nearest neighbor pattern classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"On neural-network implementations of k-nearest neighbor pattern classifiers","volume":"44","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5635236","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On neural-network implementations of k-nearest neighbor pattern classifiers","sourcePdf":"00596943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063625S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"18","articleId":"596943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":596948,"authors":[{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Derong Liu","id":"37086972259"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7122"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1268"}],"articleNumber":"596948","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloning","Cellular neural networks","Associative memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Network synthesis","Pattern recognition","Equations","Image processing","Neural network hardware","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","content-addressable storage","continuous time systems","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural networks","associative memories","design algorithm","space-invariant cloning template","cloning template design","symmetry constraints","interconnection weights","design methodology","2D continuous-time cellular neural networks","connection matrix"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a synthesis procedure (design algorithm) for cellular neural networks with space-invariant cloning template with applications to associative memories.

A transfer matrix formulation is used to solve the nonlinear propagation equation. A continuous wave (CW) input optical signal format isolates the effect of modulation instability (MI) from the signal self-phase modulation. The change of the relative intensity noise (RIN) spectrum at an optical receiver caused by MI has been analyzed extensively in multispan optical amplified systems, and thus the impact of MI in the performance of intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD) systems is evaluated. Performance of systems with distributed dispersion compensation (DC) and a lumped DC at the receiver are compared in terms of the effect of MI, the results show that the highest efficiency of DC to reduce the effect of MI can be achieved by putting a lumped DC module at the receiver side. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment demonstrates a good understanding of the mechanism of MI and its impact in the performance of terrestrial optical transmission systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.596951","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/13066/00596951.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1082","doi":"10.1109/50.596951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation instability and its impact in multispan optical amplified IMDD systems: theory and experiments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Modulation instability and its impact in multispan optical amplified IMDD systems: theory and experiments","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5646198","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation instability and its impact in multispan optical amplified IMDD systems: theory and experiments","sourcePdf":"00596951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037646S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"65","articleId":"596951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":596952,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Yan Sun","id":"37087203639"},{"name":"A.A.M.

The model predicts the output pulsewidth variation with laser cavity parameters such as cavity length, dispersion, and finesse of intracavity Fabry-Perot etalons. If the laser cavity length is not optimized, a maximum 50% increase in pulsewidth can occur at 5 Gb/s pulse rate. A repetition rate etalon with a finesse of 50 is sufficient to provide a side-mode suppression ratio of over 50 dB in the laser output. We also discuss how detuning from the optimal modulation frequency increases the excess noise that affects the laser stability. The theory predicts a maximum detuning range of /spl plusmn/100 kHz, which agrees with the experimental observations.

Resolution over the field of view in high resolution PET systems, adequate depth of interaction information must be extracted from the crystal. A phoswich detector can supply one solution to the depth of interaction problem. In this approach, two or more scintillators exhibiting different light decay times are positioned on top of each other and separated by pulse shape discrimination. Initially, the authors' experiments focused on separating different types of scintillators such as LSO and GSO or LSO and YSO. These combinations were all well separated as expected. During the investigation, a shift in the time distribution of different samples of LSO was noticed. Further investigation showed two groups of LSO. The shift in the zero cross time was more than twice the FWHM of the time distribution. A single photon experiment revealed that the decay time of the 'fast' crystal was 33.4 nanoseconds while the decay of the 'slow' crystal was 42.2 nanoseconds. A spectral plot revealed that the spectral output of the 'slow' crystal was skewed to the longer wavelengths as compared to the 'fast' crystal. Further investigation on other crystal samples revealed decay times between the two extremes, suggesting a continuum in the light decay.","doi":"10.1109/23.596973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/13077/00596973.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.596973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of LSO crystals for high spatial resolution positron emission tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596973/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of LSO crystals for high spatial resolution positron emission tomography","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5632978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of LSO crystals for high spatial resolution positron emission tomography","sourcePdf":"00596973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057673S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"89","articleId":"596973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":596974,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The high light output of LSO (/spl sim/5-6 times EGO) would allow the construction of a detector block that would have similar intrinsic resolution characteristics at 140 keV as a conventional high resolution EGO block detector at 511 keV (/spl sim/4 mm FWHM). However, the intrinsic radioactivity of LSO prevents the use of this scintillator in single photon counting mode. YSO is a scintillator with higher light output than LSO but worse absorption characteristics than LSO at higher energies. In a phoswich detector block the two detector materials are combined, where YSO is placed in a front layer and is used for single photon imaging and LSO in a second layer is used for PET imaging. Since the scintillation decay times in YSO and LSO are significantly different (70 and 40 ns, respectively), events in the two detector materials can be separated by pulse shape discrimination. In measurements of the system resolution using a high resolution collimator, the spatial resolution at 10 cm collimator distance was 8.5 mm for the phoswich detector compared to 7.6 mm for a conventional scintillation camera. However, in SPECT simulations of the two detector systems of a 20 cm diameter hot spot phantom imaged at different collimator distances using a high resolution collimator, no appreciable difference in resolution was seen in the reconstructed images between the two camera systems, including the ideal situation of zero distance between collimator and phantom.","doi":"10.1109/23.596974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/13077/00596974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.596974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13077","startPage":"1114","endPage":"1119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a YSO/LSO phoswich detector for use in a PET/SPECT system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a YSO/LSO phoswich detector for use in a PET/SPECT system","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5632979","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a YSO/LSO phoswich detector for use in a PET/SPECT system","sourcePdf":"00596974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088459S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"71","articleId":"596974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":596981,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

It consists of a ring of 30 position-sensitive scintillation detectors, each with an 8/spl times/8 array of small lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals coupled via optical fibers to a multi-channel photomultiplier tube. The detectors have an intrinsic resolution averaging 1.68 mm, an energy resolution between 15 and 25% and 2.4 ns timing resolution at 511 keV. The detector ring diameter of microPET is 17.2 cm with an imaging field of view of 112 mm transaxially by 18 mm axially. The scanner has no septa and operates exclusively in 3D mode. Reconstructed image resolution 1 cm from the center of the scanner is 2.0 mm and virtually isotropic, yielding a volume resolution of 8 mm/sup 3/. For comparison, the volume resolution of state-of-the-art clinical PET systems is in the range of 50-75 mm/sup 3/. Initial images of phantoms have been acquired and are reported. A computer controlled bed is under construction and will incorporate a small wobble motion to improve spatial sampling. This is projected to further enhance spatial resolution. MicroPET is the first PET scanner to incorporate the new scintillator LSO and to our knowledge is the highest resolution multi-ring PET scanner currently in existence.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/13077/00596981.pdf","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.596981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.596981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=596981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MicroPET: a high resolution PET scanner for imaging small animals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Positron emission tomography","High-resolution imaging","Animals","Optical imaging","Energy resolution","Spatial resolution","Optical arrays","Solid scintillation detectors","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positron emission tomography","biomedical equipment","image resolution","medical image processing","solid scintillation detectors","image reconstruction","photomultipliers","biological techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microPET","high resolution PET scanner","small animal imaging","positron emission tomography","small laboratory animals","position-sensitive scintillation detector ring","8/spl times/8 array","8 by 8 array","lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals","optical fibers","multi-channel photomultiplier tube","intrinsic resolution","energy resolution","timing resolution","3D mode","reconstructed image resolution","volume resolution","phantoms","computer controlled bed","small wobble motion","spatial sampling","spatial resolution","scintillator","highest resolution multi-ring PET scanner","511 keV","LuOSiO/sub 4/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/596981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"MicroPET: a high resolution PET scanner for imaging small animals","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5632986","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MicroPET: a high resolution PET scanner for imaging small animals","sourcePdf":"00596981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081036S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"487","articleId":"596981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":596987,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The proposed adaptive methodology constitutes a unifying and powerful framework for multichannel signal processing. Using the proposed methodology, color image filtering problems are treated from a global viewpoint that readily yields and unifies previous, seemingly unrelated, results. The new filters utilize Bayesian techniques and nonparametric methodologies to adapt to local data in the color image. The principles behind the new filters are explained in detail. Simulation studies indicate that the new filters are computationally attractive and have excellent performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/597269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","volume":"6","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5635217","pubMedId":"18282984","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Color image processing using adaptive multichannel filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color image processing using adaptive multichannel filters","sourcePdf":"00597269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043754S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"79","articleId":"597269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":597272,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

A computation for color images that approaches fidelity to scene observation must combine dynamic range compression, color consistency-a computational analog for human vision color constancy-and color and lightness tonal rendition. In this paper, we extend a previously designed single-scale center/surround retinex to a multiscale version that achieves simultaneous dynamic range compression/color consistency/lightness rendition. This extension fails to produce good color rendition for a class of images that contain violations of the gray-world assumption implicit to the theoretical foundation of the retinex. Therefore, we define a method of color restoration that corrects for this deficiency at the cost of a modest dilution in color consistency. Extensive testing of the multiscale retinex with color restoration on several test scenes and over a hundred images did not reveal any pathological behaviour.","doi":"10.1109/83.597272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13088/00597272.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.597272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiscale retinex for bridging the gap between color images and the human observation of scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=597272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"A multiscale retinex for bridging the gap between color images and the human observation of scenes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/597272/","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5635220","pubMedId":"18282987","volume":"6","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiscale retinex for bridging the gap between color images and the human observation of scenes","sourcePdf":"00597272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064183S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"1288","articleId":"597272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":597275,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Representations based on spatial filtering have restricted usefulness for recognition, however, because the output of a spatial filter across an image depends on the scene illumination conditions. We use a physically accurate linear model for spectral reflectance to derive invariants of distributions in spatially filtered color images that do not depend on the scene illumination. These invariants can be used for the illumination-invariant recognition of regions following an arbitrary linear filtering operation. We describe a method for illumination correction based on color distributions and introduce an illumination change consistency constraint that is useful for verifying matches obtained using the invariants. We show, using a set of classification experiments, that the filtered distribution invariants can significantly improve the capability of a recognition system in environments where illumination cannot be controlled.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13088/00597275.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.597275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.597275","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing illumination-invariant descriptors of spatially filtered color image regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/597275/","displayDocTitle":"Computing illumination-invariant descriptors of spatially filtered color image regions","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5635223","pubMedId":"18282990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing illumination-invariant descriptors of spatially filtered color image regions","sourcePdf":"00597275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037119S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"34","articleId":"597275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":597281,"authors":[{"name":"B.E.

The internal programming signals are analog, but the external control interface is fully digital. On-chip nonlinear digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) map digitally coded weight values into analog control signals, using feedback to predistort their transfer characteristics in accordance to the response of the analog programming circuitry. This strategy cancels out the nonlinear dependence of the analog circuitry with the programming signal and reduces the influence of interchip technological parameters random fluctuations. The chip includes a small digital RAM memory to store eight sets of processing parameters in the periphery of the cell array and four 2-D binary images spatially distributed over the processing array. It also includes the necessary control circuitry to realize the stored instructions in any order and also to realize programmable logic operations among images. The chip architecture is based on the cellular neural/nonlinear network universal machine (CNN-UM).

However, new comparisons performed on more efficient CMOS circuit realizations and a wider range of different logic cells, as well as the use of realistic circuit arrangements demonstrate CMOS to be superior to CPL in most cases with respect to speed, area, power dissipation, and power-delay products. An implemented 32-b adder using complementary CMOS has a power-delay product of less than half that of the CPL version. Robustness with respect to voltage scaling and transistor sizing, as well as generality and ease-of-use, are additional advantages of CMOS logic gates, especially when cell-based design and logic synthesis are targeted.

The phase detector, which decides the transmitted symbol from received signal power, detects phase errors up to /spl plusmn/45/spl deg/ and enables the loop to internally eliminate the /spl plusmn/80 kHz carrier-frequency offset. The fractionally spaced equalizer is implemented at the same clock rate as the symbol-spaced equalizer by increasing only multiplexers and flip-flops, though the former theoretically requires an operation twice as fast as the latter. A large scale integrator (LSI) operating at a symbol rate up to 8 MBaud is successfully implemented.

Traditional on-chip decoupling methods exhibit transients in the supply or voltage drops and power losses. This paper introduces the RLC decoupling method that features an enhanced transient response while being especially suited for low-power, low voltage applications. Both a theoretical and a practical approach are presented together with measurement results. As the benefits of a stable local power supply can be lost by the inadequate connection of two subcircuits with relative variations on the local grounds, a differential approach of signal transfer is proposed. Furthermore, the effect of a good local decoupling can be deteriorated by substrate noise, so some attention is given to this problem too.","doi":"10.1109/4.597306","startPage":"1136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/13087/00597306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.597306","endPage":"1141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design strategies and decoupling techniques for reducing the effects of electrical interference in mixed-mode IC's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/597306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design strategies and decoupling techniques for reducing the effects of electrical interference in mixed-mode IC's","volume":"32","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5640120","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design strategies and decoupling techniques for reducing the effects of electrical interference in mixed-mode IC's","sourcePdf":"00597306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059051S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"67","articleId":"597306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":597309,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3D model of the human hand or an image appearance model of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient \"purposive\" approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI.

Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \"Fisherface\" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","volume":"19","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5661535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: recognition using class specific linear projection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: recognition using class specific linear projection","sourcePdf":"00598228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046385S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"7990","articleId":"598228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":598229,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A common approach to overcoming image variations because of changes in the illumination conditions is to use image representations that are relatively insensitive to these variations. Examples of such representations are edge maps, image intensity derivatives, and images convolved with 2D Gabor-like filters. Here we present an empirical study that evaluates the sensitivity of these representations to changes in illumination, as well as viewpoint and facial expression. Our findings indicated that none of the representations considered is sufficient by itself to overcome image variations because of a change in the direction of illumination. Similar results were obtained for changes due to viewpoint and expression. Image representations that emphasized the horizontal features were found to be less sensitive to changes in the direction of illumination. However, systems based only on such representations failed to recognize up to 20 percent of the faces in our database. Humans performed considerably better under the same conditions. We discuss possible reasons for this superiority and alternative methods for overcoming illumination effects in recognition.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/13123/00598229.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition: the problem of compensating for changes in illumination direction","doi":"10.1109/34.598229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.598229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition: the problem of compensating for changes in illumination direction","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5661536","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition: the problem of compensating for changes in illumination direction","sourcePdf":"00598229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052979S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"659","articleId":"598229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":598230,"authors":[{"name":"T.

While the traditional approach relies on the use of 3D models, simpler techniques are applicable under restricted conditions. The approach exploits image transformations that are specific to the relevant object class, and learnable from example views of other \"prototypical\" objects of the same class. In this paper, we introduce such a technique by extending the notion of linear class proposed by the authors (1992). For linear object classes, it is shown that linear transformations can be learned exactly from a basis set of 2D prototypical views. We demonstrate the approach on artificial objects and then show preliminary evidence that the technique can effectively \"rotate\" high-resolution face images from a single 2D view.","doi":"10.1109/34.598230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/13123/00598230.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.598230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear object classes and image synthesis from a single example image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598230/","displayDocTitle":"Linear object classes and image synthesis from a single example image","volume":"19","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5661537","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear object classes and image synthesis from a single example image","sourcePdf":"00598230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031437S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"263","articleId":"598230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":598231,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Sources of variability include individual appearance, 3D pose, facial expression, and lighting. We describe a compact parametrized model of facial appearance which takes into account all these sources of variability. The model represents both shape and gray-level appearance, and is created by performing a statistical analysis over a training set of face images. A robust multiresolution search algorithm is used to fit the model to faces in new images. This allows the main facial features to be located, and a set of shape, and gray-level appearance parameters to be recovered. A good approximation to a given face can be reconstructed using less than 100 of these parameters. This representation can be used for tasks such as image coding, person identification, 3D pose recovery, gender recognition, and expression recognition. Experimental results are presented for a database of 690 face images obtained under widely varying conditions of 3D pose, lighting, and facial expression. The system performs well on all the tasks listed above.","doi":"10.1109/34.598231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/13123/00598231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.598231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13123","startPage":"743","endPage":"756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic interpretation and coding of face images using flexible models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic interpretation and coding of face images using flexible models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5661538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic interpretation and coding of face images using flexible models","sourcePdf":"00598231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056077S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"436","articleId":"598231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":598232,"authors":[{"name":"I.A.

To avoid use of this heuristic coding scheme, we have used our computer vision system to probabilistically characterize facial motion and muscle activation in an experimental population, thus deriving a new, more accurate, representation of human facial expressions that we call FACS+.

Stochastic models attribute tree structures to random probabilistic factors, whereas in the discharge-avalanche model mechanism-driven field fluctuations are responsible. Here we review the predictions of these approaches in the light of the available experimental evidence. It is shown that both models give the fractal structures and the form of structure distribution observed experimentally. The width of the distribution functions predicted are, however, less than those found experimentally. The quantitative formulation available to the physical model also enables it to reproduce several other features of tree propagation such as voltage dependence, growth laws, and discharge behavior patterns. This is not possible in the stochastic approach without mechanistic assumptions which are difficult to relate to the stochastic process. The connection between the discharge-avalanche model and deterministic chaos is explored. Experimental evidence is presented supporting the contention that the electrical treeing phenomenon is the result of a deterministic breakdown mechanism operating in a chaotic regime at fields lower than those required for runaway breakdown. Space-charge deposition and re-arrangement is proposed as the physical origin of the chaotic field fluctuations. Tree shapes are shown to be related to the variation in the fluctuation range available as the tree grows in accord with the predictions of the discharge-avalanche model.","doi":"10.1109/94.598282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13164","startPage":"259","endPage":"279","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/13164/00598282.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.598282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of electrical tree structures in solid polymeric insulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree data structures","Polymers","Stochastic processes","Fluctuations","Chaos","Optical propagation","Electric breakdown","Fractals","Distribution functions","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["organic insulating materials","polymers","trees (electrical)","stochastic processes","chaos","fractals","space charge"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution function","solid polymeric insulation","electrical tree propagation","stochastic model","random probabilistic factors","discharge-avalanche model","field fluctuations","fractal structure","growth law","chaos","deterministic breakdown","space charge deposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Propagation of electrical tree structures in solid polymeric insulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5680386","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of electrical tree structures in solid polymeric insulation","sourcePdf":"00598282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051241S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"107","articleId":"598282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":598285,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Efficient utilization of the available CATV spectrum requires a communication system which is dedicated to the specific properties of these networks. This paper presents the physical layer of a bidirectional communication system for HFC CATV networks which is based on CDMA, a technique that has a certain robustness to the ingress noise found in the CATV bandwidth. Because the application of asynchronous CDMA results in a poor spectral efficiency, a transmission scheme based on synchronous CDMA is adopted. Using synchronous CDMA and QPSK modulation, a capacity of 64 channels of 64 kbit/s each can be achieved in a bandwidth of 6 MHz. It is found that small synchronization errors can be tolerated without significant performance degradation. Next, a description is given of the cable modems responsible for the communication between subscribers and a CATV headend. The design exploits the typical CATV network configuration to enable a cost-effective hardware realization. Sensitivity of system performance to linear distortion is investigated by computer simulation. Especially linearly varying group delay and uneven amplitude response are shown to be potential causes of performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/11.598361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/13091/00598361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.598361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13091","startPage":"127","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CDMA based bidirectional communication system for hybrid fiber-coax CATV networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CDMA based bidirectional communication system for hybrid fiber-coax CATV networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5605851","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CDMA based bidirectional communication system for hybrid fiber-coax CATV networks","sourcePdf":"00598361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069388S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"7","articleId":"598361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":598364,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Simulcasting provides a diversity gain which has been shown to yield good coverage. In traditional analysis uncorrelated shadow fading is used. In some cases this assumption does not capture the behaviour of the shadow fading, e.g., when several transmitters are shadowed by a large obstacle. We investigate the changes in coverage due to correlation among the received signals field strength from different transmitters. A spatial shadow fading correlation model is proposed and validated using the Blomquist-Ladell (1974) prediction method on a digital terrain data base. Results for both wide area and local SFN show that the coverage properties depends on the correlation in the shadow fading. This will affect the planning process since strong correlation, due to the structure of the terrain, yields better coverage for high transmitter powers (interference limited systems) and worse coverage for low transmitter powers (noise limited systems).","doi":"10.1109/11.598364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/13091/00598364.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.598364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of single frequency networks in correlated shadow fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of single frequency networks in correlated shadow fading","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5605854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of single frequency networks in correlated shadow fading","sourcePdf":"00598364.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019416S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"31","articleId":"598364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":598365,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two receiver sites (at the Applied Phys. Laboratory ~APL\\ of The Johns Hopkins University and COMSAT Laboratories) are located in Central Maryland, and the other is located in Virginia. The APL and COMSAT locations are separated by 33 km. The Virginia site is separated from APL by 44.5 km and from COMSAT by 30.5 km. Receivers at each of the sites measure the 20-GHz CW signal level from the radiating beacon onboard the geostationary Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). Because of the lateral variability of rain, the likelihood is diminished that intense rain cells will simultaneously intersect all three Earth-satellite paths. There is also a reduced likelihood that intense rain will simultaneously intersect two Earth-satellite paths associated with different two-site scenarios. Hence, a substantially smaller rain-fade margin is required when the sites operate in a diversity mode (e.g., connected together such that the largest signal is used) vis-a-vis uncoupled single terminal operation. In this effort, we examine the efficacy of employing three-site and two-site space-diversity systems to reduce the required fade margin. Single- and joint-terminal rain-fade distributions are calculated for both the three-site and different combinations of two-site scenarios. Diversity gains, which give a measure of the reduced fade margin, are determined from these distributions. The distributions and diversity gains are also individually determined for two six-month periods of the year for which precipitation is predominantly convective or stratiform, respectively. Comparisons between measured diversity gains and those estimated using the model of the radiocommunications sector of the International Telecommunications Union are made.","doi":"10.1109/5.598419","startPage":"970","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/13108/00598419.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.598419","endPage":"980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-site space-diversity experiment at 20 GHz using ACTS in the Eastern United States","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Three-site space-diversity experiment at 20 GHz using ACTS in the Eastern United States","volume":"85","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5656048","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-site space-diversity experiment at 20 GHz using ACTS in the Eastern United States","sourcePdf":"00598419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023604S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"29","articleId":"598419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":598420,"authors":[{"name":"M.-S.

Many of these systems will involve low-margin very small aperture terminals (VSATs). These systems are subject to important atmospheric propagation degradations that affect the quality of transmission and the link availability. The objective of this paper is to characterize the Ka-band channel and evaluate the performance degradation in VSATs resulting from atmospheric propagation, impairments. In particular microwave propagation through a turbulent atmosphere is discussed, and the statistical characterization and modeling of tropospheric scintillation is reviewed. Moreover, the paper extends the method proposed by Filip and Vilar (1990) for the long-term characterization and modeling of the combined effect of rain impairments and scintillation. Specifically, the increase in noise temperature during rain events is added to the Filip-Vilar model. This leads to a five-parameter global fading distribution that is used to predict typical Ka-band satellite link outage time, the mathematical formalism is illustrated by applying the method to the selected case of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS)-Georgia Tech experimental downlink.

A general formulation of the integral representation is given for observation points lying in the Huygens' surface. As compared to the homogeneous-space case, additional terms in the integral representation have to be considered if parts of the Huygens' surface lie in an interface of layers with different material properties. An integral equation is formulated and discretized by a Galerkin testing procedure (boundary-element method), together with the finite-element (FE) system resulting in an unequivocal discretized description of the entire field problem.

The former is used to obtain modes characteristics for a central frequency, whereas the latter employs an efficient algorithm to compute frequency moments for each mode. These moments are then matched via Pade approximation to a reduced-order rational polynomial, which can be used to interpolate each mode over a frequency band with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the moments computations and subsequent interpolation for a given set of frequency points can be done much more rapidly than just simple simulations for each frequency point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast frequency sweep technique for the efficient analysis of dielectric waveguides","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.598450","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/13109/00598450.pdf","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.598450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast frequency sweep technique for the efficient analysis of dielectric waveguides","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5640157","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast frequency sweep technique for the efficient analysis of dielectric waveguides","sourcePdf":"00598450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047536S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","articleId":"598450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":598464,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Sags have been commonly characterized in terms of magnitude and duration. However several experiments are presented which show that sag magnitude and duration are insufficient to characterize contactor performance. The results of these experiments show that contactor drop out and recovery depend on point on wave occurrence of the event as well as duration.

Using GAs, optimal or near optimal fuzzy rules and membership functions can be designed without a human operator's experience or a control engineer's knowledge, although such information can be used for the initial design. This genetic/fuzzy approach involves searching the encoded fuzzy rule and membership function parameter spaces using a fitness function that is defined in terms of a system performance criterion. We demonstrate this approach in an application where a GA adapts the fuzzy rules and membership functions of a fuzzy controller for a tracking system in real-time. The generalization ability of this tracking system is demonstrated by training it only on a step input, freezing its adaptable parameters, and then showing that it can accurately track other types of input signals.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1997.598599","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE SOUTHEASTCON '97.

The mechanism which generates FM clicks even in the region of high SNRs, in simulcast as well as in multipath, is suggested. It is shown that a simple model based on two unmodulated carriers is capable of not only qualitatively explaining the phenomenon, but also of providing quantitative estimates which match well with experimental results obtained both in laboratory and in field tests. The observed \"equivalency\" of the Doppler spread and the frequency offset in their effect on the BER has been given an analytic form. The analysis applies to a narrowband M-FSK system with FM discriminator and post-detection filter.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1997.598681","startPage":"244","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE SOUTHEASTCON '97.

By using this improved HBT device, the 77-GHz VCO exhibits a measured oscillation frequency of 77.6 GHz with a peak output power of -3 dBm, while the 94-GHz VCO demonstrates a measured oscillation frequency of 94.7 GHz with a peak output power of -3.5 dBm.

This method was developed to overcome limitations in an otherwise promising technique called residual-excited linear prediction (RELP). In the new method, the stored speech unit is processed with a suitably shaped time-varying filter. The filtered signal is modified according to the required change in the fundamental frequency. The modified filtered signal is applied to the inverse of the above-mentioned prefilter. Based on observations of spectra of multiple recordings of the same speech unit at different pitch frequencies, the magnitude response of the inverse filter was chosen to have a significantly less peaky structure than that which is typically obtained in LPC. Speech modifications using this method were found to be superior in quality to those obtained by RELP, while at the same time being less sensitive than RELP to changes in pitch marking.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598811","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1626 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse filter approach to pitch modification: application to concatenative synthesis of female speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inverse filter approach to pitch modification: application to concatenative synthesis of female speech","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598811/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730520","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse filter approach to pitch modification: application to concatenative synthesis of female speech","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043029S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"598811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598826,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Conventional speech representations such as the sound spectrogram emphasize many spectro-temporal details that are not directly germane to the linguistic information encoded in the speech signal and which consequently do not display the perceptual stability characteristic of human listeners. We propose a new representational format, the modulation spectrogram, that discards much of the spectro-temporal detail in the speech signal and instead focuses on the underlying, stable structure incorporated in the low-frequency portion of the modulation spectrum distributed across critical-band-like channels. We describe the representation and illustrate its stability with color-mapped displays and with results from automatic speech recognition experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598826","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598826.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1650 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The modulation spectrogram: in pursuit of an invariant representation of speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598826/","displayDocTitle":"The modulation spectrogram: in pursuit of an invariant representation of speech","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730524","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The modulation spectrogram: in pursuit of an invariant representation of speech","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050514S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"63","articleId":"598826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":598832,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Due to the fact that most standards do not specify these algorithms bit exactly, there is room for new solutions to improve the speech quality. This article develops a new approach for optimum estimation of the speech codec parameters. It can be applied to any speech codec standard if bit reliability information is provided by the demodulator (e.g. DECT), or by the channel decoder (e.g. soft-output Viterbi algorithm-SOVA in GSM). The proposed method includes an inherent muting mechanism leading to a graceful degradation of speech quality in case of adverse transmission conditions. Particularly the additional exploitation of the residual source redundancy, i.e. some a priori knowledge about the codec parameters gives a significant enhancement of the output speech quality. In the case of an error free channel, bit exactness as required by the standards can be preserved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598832.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598832","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1670 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust speech decoding: a universal approach to bit error concealment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598832/","displayDocTitle":"Robust speech decoding: a universal approach to bit error concealment","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5738204","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speech decoding: a universal approach to bit error concealment","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034338S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"34","articleId":"598832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":598855,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The rescoring performance of top-down rules for fricatives is discussed on an isolated-word speech database of French with 1000 utterances pronounced by five speakers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598855/","accessionNumber":"5738205","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rescoring under fuzzy measures with a multilayer neural network in a rule-based speech recognition system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rescoring under fuzzy measures with a multilayer neural network in a rule-based speech recognition system","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027562S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","articleId":"598855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":598857,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

It is also being tested and proved considerably important in a wide range of applications. The model parameters of the HMM are essential in describing the behavior of the utterance of the speech segments. Many successful heuristic algorithms are developed to optimize the model parameters in order to best describe the trained observation sequences. However, all these methodologies explore for only one local maxima in practice. No one methodology can recover from the local maxima the global maxima or other more optimized local maxima. A stochastic search method called the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for HMM training. The GA mimics natural evolution and perform global searching within the defined searching space. Experiments showed that using the GA for HMM training (GA-HMM training) result in a better performance than using other heuristic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598857/","accessionNumber":"5730542","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of HMM by a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of HMM by a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034441S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"32","articleId":"598857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":598863,"authors":[{"name":"D.X.

Numerous approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, most of the methods are based on the idea of using context-dependent speech units, which inevitably increases the complexity of the model space. This paper presents a new approach of speech co-articulation modeling with complexity only comparable to context-independent models. In this model, the movement of a sequence of speech signals is characterized by a set of anchor points in the feature vector space that correspond to the target phonemic units. The transitions between the phonemic units due to co-articulation are modeled as interpolations between the target vectors. Two types of parameters are involved in the models: the intrinsic parameters in the models of target units and the auxiliary parameters specifying the transitional units. The auxiliary parameters are estimated \"online\" for a given sequence of speech feature vectors, hence it does not contribute to the complexity of the models. Unlike \"triphone\"-type context dependent models, the complexity of this approach is comparable to the context independent phoneme models, yet, some phonetic classification experiments showed that the new model can achieve the same performance as the more complex context dependent models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598863","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598863.pdf","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1754 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of co-articulation in continuous speech based on data driven interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of co-articulation in continuous speech based on data driven interpolation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of co-articulation in continuous speech based on data driven interpolation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033828S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"3","articleId":"598863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598872,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To do this, we use the Phonebook database (Pitrelli et al., 1995) which is particularly well suited to this kind of experiment since (1) it is a very large telephone database and (2) the size and content of the test vocabulary is very flexible. For each system, different HMM topologies are compared to test the influence of state tying (with a number of parameters approximately kept constant) on the recognition performance. Two lexica (Phonebook and CMU) are also compared and it is shown that the CMU lexicon leads to significantly better performance. Finally, it is shown that with a quite simple system and a few adaptations to the basic HMM/ANN scheme, recognition performance of 98.5% and 94.7% can easily be achieved, respectively on a lexicon of 75 and 600 words (isolated words, telephone speech and lexicon words not present in the training data).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598872/","accessionNumber":"5730551","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid HMM/ANN systems for training independent tasks: experiments on Phonebook and related improvements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid HMM/ANN systems for training independent tasks: experiments on Phonebook and related improvements","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03081S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"11","articleId":"598872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598873,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, this requires detailed knowledge about the vocabulary, and transcribed training data. If portability to new topics and languages is important, then a topic spotter based on phoneme recognition is preferable. A phoneme recognizer is run on training data consisting of audio files labeled by topic alone-no word transcripts are required. Phoneme sub-sequences which help to predict the topic are then extracted automatically. The work described was carried out by two teams exploring three very different approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: the \"DP-ngram\", the \"decision tree\", and the \"Euclidean\" approach. Results obtained by each team on the ARM (Airborne Reconnaissance Mission) and Switchboard data sets were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The best performance for each team was obtained via a similar type of discriminative training.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598890.pdf","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1822 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: an experimental comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Reconnaissance","Frequency","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Laboratories","Educational institutions","Vocabulary","Data mining","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","speech processing","decision theory","grammars","dynamic programming","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phoneme based topic spotting","experimental comparison","large vocabulary recognizer","keyword spotter","transcribed training data","language portability","topic portability","phoneme recognition","phoneme recognizer","training data","audio files","phoneme subsequences","DP-ngram","decision tree","Euclidean approach","Airborne Reconnaissance Mission data set","Switchboard data set","performance","receiver operating characteristic curves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: an experimental comparison","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: an experimental comparison","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036539S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"8","articleId":"598890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":598893,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.N.

More precisely, we show that four often studied problems in signal processing, spectrum analysis, information theory, and computing are closely related or even equivalent in a certain sense (if one of them can be solved, so can any of the others, and using essentially the same algorithms). The problems are (i) a nonlinear band-limited finite-dimensional interpolation problem (ii) the problem of estimating a signal that is the superposition of a finite number of harmonics (iii) an error-control coding problem in the real field, and (iv) certain techniques that occur in algorithm-based fault tolerant computing. The advantages of recognizing these problems as equivalent are obvious: the techniques commonly used in one field can be imported to the others, the duplication of research efforts is prevented, and the overall degree of understanding of the four problems increases. New algorithms are suggested as a result of these investigations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598893","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598893.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1834 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation, spectrum analysis, error-control coding, and fault-tolerant computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598893/","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation, spectrum analysis, error-control coding, and fault-tolerant computing","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730566","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation, spectrum analysis, error-control coding, and fault-tolerant computing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029785S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"13","articleId":"598893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598897,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Existing interference suppression methods do not perform well for most types of nonstationary interference. We first consider interference suppression schemes based on adaptive orthogonal time-frequency decompositions, such as wavelet packet and arbitrary dyadic time-frequency tilings. These methods often reduce interference substantially, but their performance can vary dramatically with minor changes in interference characteristics such as the center frequency. To circumvent these drawbacks, we propose a multiple overdetermined tiling (MODT) with an accompanying blind interference excision scheme which appears very promising for mitigating time-frequency-concentrated interference. Simulations with narrowband, impulsive, and simultaneous impulsive and narrowband interference compare the performance of the various methods and illustrate the promise of approaches based on multiple overdetermined tilings.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598906","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00598906.pdf","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1884 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread spectrum interference suppression using adaptive time-frequency tilings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598906/","displayDocTitle":"Spread spectrum interference suppression using adaptive time-frequency tilings","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738216","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread spectrum interference suppression using adaptive time-frequency tilings","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00598906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043959S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"9","articleId":"598906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598933,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The topology of each letter-model only permits transitions from each NN to itself or to its neighbors. In order to deal with the great variability proper to cursive handwriting in the omni-scriptor framework, they implement a holistic approach during both learning and recognition by performing adaptive segmentation. Also, the recognition step implements interactive recognition and segmentation. The approach compares neural techniques combined with dynamic programming to its extension to the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. The first system gives quite good recognition rates on letter databases obtained from 10 different writers, and results improve considerably when one considers the extension of the first system to the durational HMM framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1995.598942","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4755/13183/00598942.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1995.598942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13183","startPage":"50","endPage":"53 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hidden Markov model extension of a neural predictive system for on-line character recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=598942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hidden Markov model extension of a neural predictive system for on-line character recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/598942/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5628958","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hidden Markov model extension of a neural predictive system for on-line character recognition","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00598942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032426S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","isNumber":"13183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755","citationCount":"6","articleId":"598942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":598958,"authors":[{"name":"U.

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data.

Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

We show that a scanner-digitized image of an old ceramic object can be analyzed by GA to reconstruct the revolution surface and to develop the 2-dimensional image on the 3-dimensional object.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1995.599008","startPage":"339","endPage":"342 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1995.599008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13183","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4755/13183/00599008.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovering decorative patterns of ceramic objects from a monocular image using a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599008/","displayDocTitle":"Recovering decorative patterns of ceramic objects from a monocular image using a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5629003","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering decorative patterns of ceramic objects from a monocular image using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00599008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037311S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","isNumber":"13183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755","citationCount":"2","articleId":"599008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":599021,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Many of the recently proposed approaches make use of the block motion compensation (BMC) approach for compression. In this paper we propose a multiframe extension to BMC coding. The multiframe BMC (MF-BMC) coder makes use of the redundancy that exists across multiple frames in typical video-conferencing sequences to achieve additional compression over that obtained by using the single frame BMC (SF-BMC) approach, such as the base level H.263 codec. The advantage of the MF-BMC approach is that it is more robust to error propagation when compared to the traditional SF-BMC, as it makes use of information from multiple frames. The MF-BMC coder proposed in this paper is a multiframe extension of the base level H.263 coder and is found to be more robust than the base level H.263 coder when subjected to simulated errors commonly encountered on wireless channels.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.599085","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13189/00599085.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"957 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.599085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiframe block motion compensated video coding for wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599085/","displayDocTitle":"Multiframe block motion compensated video coding for wireless channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5710112","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiframe block motion compensated video coding for wireless channels","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00599085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037311S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"12","articleId":"599085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599086,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

This utility is demonstrated through numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.599086","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13189/00599086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.599086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13189","startPage":"958","endPage":"962 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of optimal digital page detection in a two-dimensional ISI/AWGN channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimal digital page detection in a two-dimensional ISI/AWGN channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599086/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5710113","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimal digital page detection in a two-dimensional ISI/AWGN channel","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00599086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045755S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"16","articleId":"599086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":599088,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Sung-Soo Kim","id":"37087152609"},{"name":"T.

In this paper we derive a continuous wavelet domain EC processor for the detection of signals that have propagated over stochastic propagation and scattering channels. The derivation shows that the wavelet transforms that are used for the conditional mean estimator (CME) and for the computation of the detection statistic must be defined by using reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) inner products rather than ordinary Hilbert space inner products. This fact suggests new weighted wavelet (as well as other time-frequency and time-scale) transforms.

It relies on the choice of particular values for the PRFs. The folded frequency of the target signal is obtained by averaging the folded frequency estimates for each PRF, and a quasi maximum likelihood criterion is maximized for ambiguity order estimation. The fast implementation of this nonambiguous estimation procedure is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), The proposed waveform allows full exploitation of any (even) number of PRFs, which appears to be important for estimation improvement. The effects of the waveform parameters and the folded frequency estimation variance on the performance of the ambiguity order estimation procedure are evaluated theoretically and through computer simulations. Mean square error (MSE) curves are given to assess the Doppler frequency estimation accuracy. Finally, the new method is compared with a classical technique and the implementation of the algorithm in a clutter environment is addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/13075/00599236.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.599236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.599236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler ambiguity resolution using multiple PRF","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Doppler radar","Pulse measurements","Radar cross section","Fast Fourier transforms","Clutter","Velocity measurement","Radar tracking","Signal resolution","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","pulse frequency modulation","frequency estimation","radar signal processing","maximum likelihood estimation","fast Fourier transforms","radar clutter","radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler ambiguity resolution","multiple PRF","velocity ambiguity resolution","algorithm","coherent pulsed Doppler radar","folded frequency","quasi maximum likelihood criterion","ambiguity order estimation","fast implementation","fast Fourier transform","waveform parameter effects","frequency estimation variance","computer simulation","mean square error curves","clutter environment","signal model","white noise only environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Doppler ambiguity resolution using multiple PRF","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5633014","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler ambiguity resolution using multiple PRF","sourcePdf":"00599236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030083S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"42","articleId":"599236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":599239,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

When there are relative motions between an emitter and receivers, frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements can be used as well. Often, the altitude of an object is known (it is zero, for example) or can be measured with an altimeter. Two sets of geolocation solutions are proposed which exploit the altitude constraint to improve the localization accuracy. One is for TDOAs alone and the other for the combination of TDOA and FDOA measurements. The additional complexity by imposing the constraint is a one-dimensional Newton's search and the rooting of a polynomial. The covariance matrices of the new estimators are derived under a small measurement noise assumption and shown to attain the constrained Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). When there is a bias error in the assumed altitude, using the altitude constraint will introduce a bias to the solution. Since applying the constraint decreases the variance, there is a tradeoff between variance and bias in the mean square error (MSE). The maximum allowable altitude error such that the constraint solution will remain superior to the unconstraint is given. Simulation results are included to corroborate the theoretical development.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geolocation of a known altitude object from TDOA and FDOA measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.599239","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/13075/00599239.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.599239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Geolocation of a known altitude object from TDOA and FDOA measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5633016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geolocation of a known altitude object from TDOA and FDOA measurements","sourcePdf":"00599239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049107S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"131","articleId":"599239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":599256,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

The intended use of the algorithm is in the context of multitarget tracking, where it has been shown that real-time multitarget tracking is feasible for some problems, but many other uses of the algorithm are also possible. The following three optimizations are discussed: (1) inheriting dual variables and partial solutions during partitioning, (2) sorting subproblems by lower cost bounds before solving, and (3) partitioning in an optimized order. When used to find the 100 best solutions to random 100/spl times/100 assignment problems, these optimizations produce a speedup of over a factor of 20, finding all 100 solutions in about 0.6 s. For a random cost matrix, the average time complexity for finding k solutions to random N/spl times/N problems appears to be nearly linear in both k and N, for sufficiently large k.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Partitioning algorithms","National electric code","Sorting","Cost function","Bipartite graph","Time measurement","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","tracking filters","travelling salesman problems","computational complexity","linear programming","matrix algebra","directed graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Murty's ranked assignment method","algorithm implementation","ranked set of solutions","assignment problems","multitarget tracking","real-time tracking","optimization","inheriting dual variables","partial solutions","partitioning","sorting subproblems","lower cost bounds","random cost matrix","average time complexity","bipartite graph","adjacency matrix","least cost assignment","pseudocode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.599256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/13075/00599256.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.599256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Murty's ranked assignment method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Murty's ranked assignment method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599256/","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5633023","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Murty's ranked assignment method","sourcePdf":"00599256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04939S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"82","articleId":"599256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":599263,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The Cooley-Tukey FFT is shown to be a special case of the proposed algorithm when the wavelets in use are trivial. If no intermediate coefficients are dropped and no approximations are made, the proposed algorithm computes the exact result, and its computational complexity is on the same order of the FFT, i.e. O(N log/sub 2/ N). The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the good time and frequency localization of wavelets can be exploited to approximate the Fourier transform for many classes of signals resulting in much less computation. Thus the new algorithm provides an efficient complexity vs. accuracy tradeoff. When approximations are allowed, under certain sparsity conditions, the algorithm can achieve linear complexity, i.e. O(N).

If the dc output voltage is low, the efficiency of the converter is dominated by the efficiency of the rectifier. Low on-resistance metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are used in the rectifier instead of diodes because the forward voltage drop across the rectifying device is low, resulting in a high efficiency. The dc output voltage is regulated against variations in the load resistance and the dc input voltage by varying the operating frequency. Experimental results are presented for a converter with a dc input voltage of 150 V, an output voltage of 5 V, and a dc load resistance ranging from 0.5 to 5.5 R. The measured efficiency was 86% for a 50 W output and 89% for a 25 W output.

An eigenanalysis-based detection method, referred to as the eigencanceler, has been shown to be a useful alternative to SMI, when the interference has low rank. In this work, the density function of the conditioned SNR is developed for the eigencanceler. The development is based on the asymptotic expansion of the distribution of the principal components of the covariance matrix. It is shown that, unlike the SMI method, the eigencanceler yields a conditional SNR distribution that is dependent on the covariance matrix, It is further shown that simpler, covariance matrix-independent approximations can be found for the large interference-to-noise case. The new distribution is shown to be in good agreement with the numerical data obtained from simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive arrays","Covariance matrix","Interference constraints","Colored noise","Detectors","Maximum likelihood detection","Vectors","Subspace constraints","Density functional theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","adaptive antenna arrays","covariance matrices","probability","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conditional signal-to-noise ratio","eigenanalysis-based adaptive array","density function","covariance matrix","eigencanceler","matrix-independent approximations","asymptotic distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.599322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/13075/00599322.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.599322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic distribution of the conditional signal-to-noise ratio in an eigenanalysis-based adaptive array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic distribution of the conditional signal-to-noise ratio in an eigenanalysis-based adaptive array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599322/","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5633036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic distribution of the conditional signal-to-noise ratio in an eigenanalysis-based adaptive array","sourcePdf":"00599322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053018S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"43","articleId":"599322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":599328,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

This paper considers the use of matching pursuit for computing signal expansions in terms of damped sinusoids. First, expansion based on complex damped sinusoids is explored; it is shown that the expansion can be efficiently derived using the FFT and simple recursive filterbanks. Then, the approach is extended to provide decompositions in terms of real damped sinusoids. This extension relies on generalizing the matching pursuit algorithm to derive expansions with respect to dictionary subspaces; of specific interest is the subspace spanned by a complex atom and its conjugate. Developing this particular case leads to a framework for deriving real-valued expansions of real signals using complex atoms. Applications of the damped sinusoidal decomposition include system identification, spectral estimation, and signal modeling for coding and analysis-modification-synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599345","startPage":"2037","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00599345.pdf","endPage":"2040 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599345/","displayDocTitle":"Matching pursuit with damped sinusoids","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5738255","publicationDate":"1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching pursuit with damped sinusoids","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035343S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"36","articleId":"599345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":599347,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Using our operator theory formulation for time-frequency representations, our \"maximal separation\" criteria takes on a very easily solved form. Analysis of the solution in both the time-frequency and ambiguity planes is given along with an example on discrete signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599347","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00599347.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599347","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2048 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class-dependent, discrete time-frequency distributions via operator theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Class-dependent, discrete time-frequency distributions via operator theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599347/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738257","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-dependent, discrete time-frequency distributions via operator theory","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062398S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"11","articleId":"599347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":599352,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Fast FSFs residing in smaller packages will be required to support future high-bandwidth, mobile image and signal processing applications. Since FSF designs rely on the exact annihilation of selected poles-zeros, a new facilitating technology is required which is fast, compact, and numerically exact. Exact FSF pole-zero annihilation is guaranteed by implementing polynomial filters over an integer ring in the residue arithmetic system (RNS). The design methodology is evaluated as an ASIC. Based on an FPGA technology, at least an 86% complexity reduction can be achieved with even greater advantages gained as a custom VLSI. An RNS-based FSF implementation of an eight channel cochlea, filter bank is presented which demonstrates both the performance and packaging advantages of the new FSF paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599352","startPage":"2061","endPage":"2064 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00599352.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of RNS frequency sampling filter banks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design of RNS frequency sampling filter banks","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5738261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599352/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of RNS frequency sampling filter banks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046856S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"4","articleId":"599352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":599355,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The difficulties come from two aspects. First, design of a fuzzy logic computer mainly uses the experience of the human experts. To acquire enough heuristic knowledge from the domain experts and to represent this kind of knowledge appropriately with a set of fuzzy rules presents difficulties. Second, it is difficult to appropriately tune the parameters used in the fuzzy logic controller. These parameters are commonly determined by a \"trial and error\" method which is rather time consuming. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is introduced to design an optimal fuzzy logic controller. The proposed method has been used to design an optimal fuzzy logic excitation controller for a generating unit.

Through the constraint satisfaction techniques, the constraints, which consist of the upper bound on the objective value, are propagated as much as possible to actively reduce the search space of the UC problem in a priori way. Consequently, the optimal solution can be acquired in a very early stage.

Four main concepts are discussed: congestion pricing can lead to the same solution as an optimal power flow; pricing need not have cost information available; good estimates of nonlinear cost coefficients are necessary; and pricing for congestion management is separable from pricing for the purpose of transmission network revenue reconciliation. Emphasis is on the determination of sufficient information by observation of the behavior of the market to permit optimum pricing without explicit communication among parties, and without generators ever being explicitly concerned about the relief of flow congestion. Results from simulated experiments are presented.","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1997.599428","startPage":"374","endPage":"380","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Power Industry Computer Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1997.599428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13050","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Power Industry Computer Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4657/13050/00599428.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Management of multiple congested conditions in unbundled operation of a power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599428/","displayDocTitle":"Management of multiple congested conditions in unbundled operation of a power system","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5679239","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11 May-16 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Management of multiple congested conditions in unbundled operation of a power system","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00599428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035615S","chronDate":"11-16 May 1997","isNumber":"13050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657","citationCount":"13","articleId":"599428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":599435,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The core supplier may not give any information about the internal logic of the core, but simply provide a set of test vectors for the core which guarantees a particular fault coverage. If the core is embedded within a larger design, then the problem is how to apply the specified test vectors to the core and how to test the user-defined logic around the core. A simple and fast solution is to place a full isolation ring (i.e., boundary scan) around the core, however, the area and performance overhead for this may not be acceptable in many applications. This paper presents a systematic method for designing a partial isolation ring that provides the same fault coverage as a full isolation ring, but avoids adding MUXes on critical timing paths and reduces area overhead. Efficient ATPG techniques are used to analyze the user-defined logic surrounding the core and identify a maximal set of core inputs and outputs (that includes the critical timing paths) that do not need to be included in the partial isolation ring. Several different partial isolation ring selection strategies that vary in computational complexity are described. Experimental results are shown comparing the different strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 15th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

The associated test generation problem was formulated as a constrained optimization problem, and an ATPG system developed to generate three-pattern robust tests that excite the worst case delay of the target path. The ATPG works on a gate level model that is augmented to capture the necessary switch level details.

Second, we use a more general specification of the reconstruction subspace V(/spl phi/), so that the output of the system can take the form of a bandlimited function, a spline, or a wavelet expansion. The system that we describe yields an approximation f/spl isin/V(/spl phi/) that is consistent with the input f(x) in the sense that it produces exactly the same measurements. We show that this solution can be computed by multivariate filtering. We also characterize the stability of the system (condition number).

It is known that for the DOA estimation of coherent signals, the computed covariance matrix of the sensor array must be spatially smoothed to preserve its full rank. Adaptive algorithms using the conjugate gradient (CG) methods can take advantage of this pre-processing by incorporating the available smoothed matrix into the algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses the CG algorithm presented previously (see IEEE ICASSP, p.2279-82, 1996) in combination with spatial and temporal smoothing techniques. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithm has a fast convergence rate even when the input signals are coherent. Due to the use of an updated covariance matrix at each time instant, no internal iterations are used as in regular CG methods, resulting in a more efficient algorithm than previously proposed CG methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599507/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738316","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Conjugate gradient method for adaptive direction-of-arrival estimation of coherent signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate gradient method for adaptive direction-of-arrival estimation of coherent signals","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055496S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"599507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":599530,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Bandwidth efficient modulation techniques, such as QAM, require highly linear amplifier performance to achieve acceptable bit error rates. The nonlinear distortion which results when an amplifier is operated near saturation may preclude their use. One attractive option is to predistort the signal by placing a nonlinear filter in the signal path which compensates for the distortion introduced by the amplifier. In this paper, we present a predistortion technique which uses an inverse amplifier model based on a Volterra series approach. The input-output data from the amplifier is used to develop the parameters for a discrete Volterra series. The RLS adaptive filter technique is utilized to provide periodic updates to the inverse filter which allows tracking of amplifier variations. Results are presented for the case of 64 QAM modulation using a TWT amplifier operated at saturation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599544","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2420 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00599544.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volterra series based modeling and compensation of nonlinearities in high power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Volterra series based modeling and compensation of nonlinearities in high power amplifiers","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5738350","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599544/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volterra series based modeling and compensation of nonlinearities in high power amplifiers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024752S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"10","articleId":"599544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":599552,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result of using the toolkit and integrating all these parts into the recognition engine the word error rate on the German spontaneous scheduling task (GSST) could be decreased from 30% word error rate in 1995 to 13.8% in 1996.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599552","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599552.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"86 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Karlsruhe-Verbmobil speech recognition engine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599552/","displayDocTitle":"The Karlsruhe-Verbmobil speech recognition engine","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716078","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Karlsruhe-Verbmobil speech recognition engine","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036774S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"34","articleId":"599552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599553,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We develop a condition previously derived by Herley and Wong (see Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Image Proc., 1996) and examine its implications. We show that this method has a number of advantages over alternative approaches. In particular it gives a condition for achieving the minimum rate rather than approaching it asymptotically. We show that it generally leads to a reconstruction scheme that is simpler than those derived by other strategies. We examine a few special cases in which the minimum rate is precisely achieveable, and cases where design of the reconstruction system is possible without explicitly knowing the signal spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738354","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction for novel sampling structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction for novel sampling structures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032379S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","articleId":"599553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599567,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The system uses an array of 46 cm wide and 30 cm high, which contains 4 microphones, and is mounted on top of the monitor. The three dimensional position of a sound source is calculated from the time delays of 4 pairs of microphones. In time delay estimation, the averaging of signal onsets of each frequency band is combined with phase correlation to reduce the influence of noise and reverberation. With this approach, it is possible to provide reliable three dimensional voice source localization by a small microphone array. Post processing based on a priori knowledge is also introduced to eliminate the influences of reflections from furniture such as tables. Results of speech source localization under real conference room conditions are given. Some system related issues are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599595","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599595.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"190 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice source localization for automatic camera pointing system in videoconferencing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599595/","displayDocTitle":"Voice source localization for automatic camera pointing system in videoconferencing","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716099","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice source localization for automatic camera pointing system in videoconferencing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03059S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"112","articleId":"599595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599605,"authors":[{"name":"Gi Hun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gi Hun Lee","id":"37657614100"},{"name":"Rae-Hong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Rae-Hong Park","id":"37267489900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"599605","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Decision feedback equalizers","Maximum likelihood estimation","Partitioning algorithms","Frequency shift keying","Power generation","Dynamic range","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","equalisers","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint blind equalization","shell partition-based CMA","QAM signal constellations","quadrature-amplitude modulation","JBE algorithm","concatenation","equalization modes","decision-directed mode","equalization performance","fast convergence","SPCMA","DD mode","16-QAM","blind equalization mode"]}],"abstract":"For quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) systems, the joint blind equalization (JBE) algorithm, concatenation of two different equalization modes, has been widely used.

Analysis of known algorithms showed that signal-processing performance of over 6 Gigaflops would be required; at the same time, there was a need for \"portability\", i.e., fitting into a small van. These tradeoffs and many others have led to a unique design in both hardware and software. This paper presents the design and its justifications. Performance data for a few important algorithms relative to usage of processing-capability, response latency, and difficulty of programming are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599616.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"254 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital processing system for source location and sound capture by large microphone arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Position measurement","Delay","Algorithm design and analysis","Real time systems","Optical fiber cables","Sampling methods","Acoustical engineering","Design engineering","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphones","acoustic transducer arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","real-time systems","software engineering","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital processing system","source location","sound capture","large microphone arrays","Huge Microphone Array project","microphone array system","algorithms","signal processing performance","software design","hardware design","performance data","response latency","programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A digital processing system for source location and sound capture by large microphone arrays","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital processing system for source location and sound capture by large microphone arrays","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085298S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"25","articleId":"599616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599617,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Thus, once a mobile desires to initiate a call, precise knowledge of the 2-D arrival angles of its dominant wavefronts is required. In this application, 3-D Unitary ESPRIT for joint 2-D angle and carrier estimation offers an efficient way to handle such mobile access requests since it provides efficient high-resolution measurements of the spatial characteristics of the wireless channel, even if only a small number of antennas is available at the base station. Automatic pairing of the 3-D estimates is achieved via a new simultaneous Schur decomposition (SSD) of three real-valued, non-symmetric matrices. In general, the SSD enables an R-dimensional extension of Unitary ESPRIT (R/spl ges/3) to estimate several undamped R-dimensional modes or frequencies along with their correct pairing in multidimensional harmonic retrieval problems. We present a Jacobi-type method to calculate the SSD. For each of the R dimensions, the corresponding frequency estimates are obtained from the real eigenvalues of a real valued matrix. The SSD jointly estimates the eigenvalues of all R-matrices and, thereby, achieves automatic pairing of the estimated R-dimensional modes via a closed-form procedure that neither requires any search nor any other heuristic pairing strategy.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599617.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"258 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599617","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D unitary ESPRIT for joint 2-D angle and carrier estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-D unitary ESPRIT for joint 2-D angle and carrier estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599617/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716116","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D unitary ESPRIT for joint 2-D angle and carrier estimation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061682S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"28","articleId":"599617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599619,"authors":[{"name":"Fuyun Ling","affiliation":["Cellular Infrastructure Group, Motorola, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Fuyun Ling","id":"37285812300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"599619","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"Optimal pilot assisted estimation of communication channels is considered for coherent cellular and PCS CDMA reverse link communications.

Among a number of techniques, the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) has proven to be an effective tool for blind beamforming of uncorrelated signals. Unfortunately, CMA beamformers encounter problems for correlated signals and interferences. In this paper, we consider correlated co-channel input signals as a result of multipath. We present two adaptation methods based on CMA to capture distinct signal sources. One approach is to use an orthogonal projection constraint on the beamformer parameters. The other approach relies on the independence of source signals and exploit a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization at beamformer outputs. The performance of our methods is shown through computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599630","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13191/00599630.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599630","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"2521","endPage":"2524 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMA beamforming for multipath correlated sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"CMA beamforming for multipath correlated sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599630/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMA beamforming for multipath correlated sources","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053613S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"7","articleId":"599630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":599632,"authors":[{"name":"Won Gi Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won Gi Jeon","id":"37408248100"},{"name":"Kyung Hi Chang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Hi Chang","id":"37857956000"},{"name":"Yong Soo Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong Soo Cho","id":"37290880800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"599632","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Time varying systems","Multipath channels","Interchannel interference","Frequency domain analysis","Equalizers","Computer errors","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","multipath channels","adjacent channel interference","time-varying channels","interference suppression","frequency division multiplexing","code division multiple access","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalization technique","OFDM","MC-CDMA","time-varying multipath fading channels","interchannel interference","subchannel orthogonality","frequency domain equalizer","ICI","error performance","computer simulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","mobile radio channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an equalization technique for OFDM and MC-CDMA systems in a time-varying multipath fading environment is described.

A simple frequency domain equalizer which can compensate the effect of time-variation in a multipath fading channel is proposed by taking into account only the ICI terms significantly affecting the error performance and by modifying the previous frequency-domain equalization techniques.

The approach, called spectral amplitude warping (SAW), consists essentially of a pre- and post-processing which apply a nonlinear transformation to the signal short-term spectrum prior to, and after, encoding. Since it is possible to view SAW as a separate entity from the coder, the noise shaping capability of an existing coder can be improved without modifying the coder itself. Using SAW as a pre- and post-process to the G.722 wideband speech coding standard, it was found in an informal listening test that the quality of the 64 kb/s operating mode can be achieved at only 48 kb/s. The price to be paid is an additional delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5723248","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectral amplitude warping (SAW) for noise spectrum shaping in audio coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral amplitude warping (SAW) for noise spectrum shaping in audio coding","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02354S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"5","articleId":"599641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":599646,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Straightforward update algorithms can not directly update the filter parameter in the controller because the transfer function of the plant might cause instabilities in the adaptive process.

We present a suboptimal detector for Gaussian bandpass transients in impulsive noise that uses a nonlinear, memoryless prefilter followed by a discrete wavelet transform. The resulting signals present a Gaussian-like behavior and the decision is achieved by the comparison of a quadratic likelihood ratio with a threshold. The tuning of the nonlinearity parameter is performed either by looking at the receiver operating characteristic or using the Chernoff distance, that, although resulting in an approximate solution, is easier to compute.

Our technique is based on the multidimensional minimization of the appropriate concentrated cost function using the genetic algorithm (GA).","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599689","startPage":"519","endPage":"522 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599689.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction finding with imperfect wavefront coherence: a matrix fitting approach using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599689/","displayDocTitle":"Direction finding with imperfect wavefront coherence: a matrix fitting approach using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5723293","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction finding with imperfect wavefront coherence: a matrix fitting approach using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046099S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"599689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":599693,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

The method is an extension of work previously reported by Manickam and Vaccaro (1993) which dealt solely with time delays and amplitudes, and extended by Habboosh and Vaccaro (see Proceedings CISS '96, p.633-8, 1996) to include Doppler scale. An algorithm is presented for determining the size of the indicator set to reduce ill-conditioning of the signal subspace matrix. Simulation results are shown and comparisons to the Cramer-Rao lower bound provided; these results show that significant reduction in estimate variances can be achieved using the deconvolution approach with a properly selected indicator set.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00599693.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"538 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm for detecting closely spaced delay/Doppler components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Delay effects","Amplitude estimation","Deconvolution","Frequency","Attenuation","Gaussian noise","Narrowband","Autocorrelation","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","signal detection","Doppler effect","delays","amplitude estimation","matrix algebra","deconvolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closely spaced delay/Doppler components detection","time delay estimation","amplitude estimation","Doppler scales","multipath signal","algorithm","indicator set size","ill-conditioning reduction","signal subspace matrix","simulation results","Cramer-Rao lower bound","estimate variances","deconvolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for detecting closely spaced delay/Doppler components","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5723297","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for detecting closely spaced delay/Doppler components","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00599693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031201S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"14","articleId":"599693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599702,"authors":[{"name":"Hongya Ge","affiliation":["Center for Communications & Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hongya Ge","id":"37285019800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"599702","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"abstract":"Presented in this article are analytical expressions of the performance measure on the LMMSE estimate-based multiuser detector, including an error probability expression and its computationally and notationally efficient approximations, signal to interference-plus-noise ratio, and asymptotic efficiency.

The pulsed power system, supplied by Physics International Company (PI) of San Leandro, CA, includes a Marx generator and a peaking circuit/transmission line pulse launch system contained within a plastic housing (gas box) filled with the insulating gas R-12 (freon). Two major concerns have developed over the years since the WWDBw simulator was first dedicated: (1) the venting of freon-12 into the atmosphere is considered harmful to the natural environment, and (2) the most recent EMP studies show that simulated field risetimes might need to be considerably faster than the 10 ns requirements of ten years ago. WWDBw has contracted with PI to provide modifications as necessary to eliminate R-12 from the gas house and to design and develop a pulser providing faster risetimes. PI's modifications have achieved reliable, reproducible operation at 970 kV in an air environment with risetimes less than 7 ns. In addition, PI has designed, fabricated and tested a pulser for risetimes of 1 ns, 300 to 500 kV output voltage, and 30 to 100 ns pulsewidth. The pulser is compatible with the 1 MV pulser interface so that either pulser can be used to drive the 90 /spl Omega/ waveguide. The fast risetime pulser uses the existing Marx to charge a transfer capacitor similar to the existing peaking capacitors. Upon closure of the transfer switch, a very low inductance peaking capacitor is charged. Subsequent closure of a low inductance output switch launches the fast risetime wave.","doi":"10.1109/PPC.1995.599806","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers.

A conventional approach employs an angle computation algorithm to control the direction of rotation in the form of a sign sequence, where the sign generation is a bottle-neck for the fast implementations. The proposed method reduces the number of sequential computations by employing a new angle representation model and linearizing the arctangent function in small angles. The direction sequence can be generated by about a third of the iterative computations required in the conventional algorithm, which also reduces the hardware requirements as much. Especially, this algorithm is attractive when pipelining is not allowed for feedback control, such as found in phase tracking applications.

The algorithm includes an on-line scale factor decomposition algorithm that transforms the complicated variable scale factor into a sequence of simple shift-and-add operations and does the variable scale factor compensation in the same fashion. On the other hand, the on-line decomposition algorithm itself can be realized with a simple and fast hardware. The new CORDIC algorithm has the smallest number of 0.8 n iterations among all the CORDIC algorithms, which requires only about two-third rotation number that of the existing best (hybrid radix-2 and radix-4) redundant algorithms. Therefore, the new algorithm achieves fast rotation iterations, high-speed and low-overhead scale factor compensations, which are hard to attain simultaneously for the existing algorithms.

Asynchronous means that the nodes do not coordinate their broadcast, and, therefore, it is possible that all nodes will start to broadcast at the same time. Simultaneous broadcast by many nodes can cause traffic congestion, which can result in a traffic loss. The main property of the broadcast algorithms presented in this work is that under any arbitrary broadcast pattern there will be no packet or cell loss due to internal traffic congestion. The routing mechanism used by the broadcast algorithm can be viewed as a variant of deflection routing, which means that a node makes on-line routing decisions based on the local flow of traffic (i.e., internal load conditions). Unlike other deflection techniques, the MetaNet routing is along a global sense of direction, which guarantees that packets will reach their destinations. Thus, we call this method convergence routing (previous deflection algorithms did not guarantee deterministic routing convergence, i.e., a cell/packet can be deflected indefinitely inside the network). As a result of the convergence property, the deflection routing used in this work is the only one with broadcast capability.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/13195/00599894.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"748","doi":"10.1109/12.599894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.599894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent asynchronous broadcast on the MetaNet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent asynchronous broadcast on the MetaNet","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5667990","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent asynchronous broadcast on the MetaNet","sourcePdf":"00599894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046749S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"599894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":599901,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Thornton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Thornton","id":"37273648900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"599901","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599901","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","adders","digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signed binary addition circuitry","inherent even parity outputs","even parity representation","check bits","parity information"]}],"abstract":"A signed binary (SE) addition circuit is presented that always produces an even parity representation of the sum word.

The power consumption and the latency for obtaining the required data are considered as the two basic performance criteria for all algorithms. First, this paper describes two algorithms namely, (1, m) indexing and Distributed Indexing, for multiplexing data and its clustering index. Second, an algorithm called Nonclustered Indexing is described for allocating static data and its corresponding nonclustered index. Then, the Nonclustered indexing algorithm is generalized to the case of multiple indexes.

The practical use of the derived formula is that it allows the estimation of the space requirements of the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition. Quadtrees are used extensively in two-dimensional spaces (geographic information systems and spatial databases in general), as well in higher dimensionality spaces (as oct-trees for three-dimensional spaces, e.g., in graphics, robotics, and three-dimensional medical images). Our formula permits the estimation of the space requirements for data hyperrectangles when stored in an index structure like a (n-dimensional) quadtree, as well as the estimation of the search time for query hyperrectangles, for the so-called linear quadtrees. A theoretical contribution of the paper is the observation that the number of blocks is a piece-wise linear function of the sides of the hyperrectangle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","publicationDate":"May-June 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5648757","volume":"9","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition for arbitrary hyperrectangles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition for arbitrary hyperrectangles","sourcePdf":"00599927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050962S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"13196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"18","articleId":"599927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599929,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Our method requires optimal storage and query times for several important queries and logarithmic update times. Three version operations-inserts, updates, and deletes-are allowed on the current database, while queries are allowed on any version, present or past. The following query operations are performed in optimal query time: key range search, key history search, and time range view. The key-range query retrieves all records having keys in a specified key range at a specified time; the key history query retrieves all records with a given key in a specified time range; and the time range view query retrieves all records that were current during a specified time interval. Special cases of these queries include the key search query, which retrieves a particular version of a record, and the snapshot query which reconstructs the database at some past time. To the best of our knowledge no previous multiversion access structure simultaneously supports all these query and version operations within these time and space bounds. The bounds on query operations are worst case per operation, while those for storage space and version operations are (worst-case) amortized over a sequence of version operations. Simulation results show that good storage utilization and query performance is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/69.599929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.599929","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/13196/00599929.pdf","startPage":"391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient multiversion access structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599929/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient multiversion access structure","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5648759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient multiversion access structure","sourcePdf":"00599929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072081S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"13196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"64","articleId":"599929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":599932,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.M.

The method can answer queries by example, such as \"find all X-rays that are similar to Smith's X-ray\". The stored images are mapped to points in a multidimensional space and are indexed using state-of-the-art database methods (R-trees). The proposed method has several desirable properties: (a) Database search is approximate, so that all images up to a prespecified degree of similarity (tolerance) are retrieved. (b) It has no \"false dismissals\" (i.e., all images qualifying query selection criteria are retrieved). (c) It is much faster than sequential scanning for searching in the main memory and on the disk (i.e., by up to an order of magnitude), thus scaling-up well for large databases.","doi":"10.1109/69.599932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/13196/00599932.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.599932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Similarity searching in medical image databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Similarity searching in medical image databases","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1997","accessionNumber":"5648762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Similarity searching in medical image databases","sourcePdf":"00599932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063735S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"13196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"145","articleId":"599932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":599939,"authors":[{"name":"Yih-Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze Institute of Technology, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Min Chen","id":"37384814900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"599939","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1063},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Direction of arrival estimation","Sensor arrays","Covariance matrix","Signal analysis","Two dimensional displays","Signal resolution","Spatial resolution","Signal processing","Multiple signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","array signal processing","correlation methods","signal resolution","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation","2D DOA estimation","coherent signals","extended preprocessing scheme","uniform rectangular array","overlapping rectangular subarrays","eigenstructure technique","2D spatial smoothing","subarray size","decorrelation","minimal subarray structure","minimal subarray grouping","sensor elements","minimal total array","high resolution techniques"]}],"abstract":"We present an analysis of a spatial smoothing scheme extended for the estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) directions of arrival (DOAs) of coherent signals using a uniform rectangular array. The uniform rectangular array is divided into overlapping rectangular subarrays by the extended scheme, which is referred to as the 2-D spatial smoothing scheme. The analysis shows that when the extended preprocessing scheme is used in conjunction with the eigenstructure technique, the size of the subarrays should be at least (K+1)/spl times/(K+1), and the number of the subarrays must be no less than K/spl times/K in order to guarantee the \"decorrelation\" of /spl kappa/ coherent signals for all possible scenarios. The minimum size of the total uniform rectangular array is thus shown to be 2K/spl times/2K. Instead of using a uniform rectangular array, a minimal subarray structure incorporated with a minimal subarray grouping is also devised for resolving the 2-D DOAs of K coherent signals.

The coefficients of the corresponding signal approximations are typically obtained by direct sampling (interpolation or quasi-interpolation) or by using least squares techniques that apply a prefilter prior to sampling. We compare the performance of these approaches and provide quantitative error estimates that can be used for the appropriate selection of the sampling step h. Specifically, we review several results in approximation theory with a special emphasis on the Strang-Fix (1971) conditions, which relate the general O(h/sup L/) behavior of the error to the ability of the representation to reproduce polynomials of degree n=L-1. We use this theory to derive pointwise error estimates for the various algorithms and to obtain the asymptotic limit of the L/sub 2/-error as h tends to zero. We also propose a new improved L/sub 2/-error bound for the least squares case. In the process, we provide all the relevant bound constants for polynomial splines. Some of our results suggest the existence of an intermediate range of sampling steps where the least squares method is roughly equivalent to an interpolator with twice the order. We present experimental examples that illustrate the theory and confirm the adequacy of our various bound and limit determinations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the approximation power of convolution-based least squares versus interpolation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.599940","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13197/00599940.pdf","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"On the approximation power of convolution-based least squares versus interpolation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5655832","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the approximation power of convolution-based least squares versus interpolation","sourcePdf":"00599940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052304S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"83","articleId":"599940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599941,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh Tuan Pham","affiliation":["Laboratory of Modeling and Computation, IMAG, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, University of Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"lastName":"Dinh Tuan Pham","id":"37278465600"},{"name":"P.

This method consists of two parts: the maximum likelihood constellation estimation and assignment. We show that at high SNR, the maximum likelihood constellation estimation is well approximated by the smallest distance clustering algorithm, which we proposed earlier on heuristic grounds. We observe that both these methods for estimating the constellation vectors perform very well at high SNR and nearly attain Cramer-Rao bounds. Using this fact and noting that the assignment algorithm causes negligible error at high SNR, we derive upper bounds on the probability of bit error for the above method at high SNR. These upper bounds fall very rapidly with increasing SNR, showing that our constellation estimation-assignment approach is very efficient.

Then, by suitably arranging the elements within that matrix, the entries of the original channel matrix are estimated row by row. Simulations results are given to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13197","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13197/00599945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel blind estimation algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel blind estimation algorithm","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5655837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel blind estimation algorithm","sourcePdf":"00599945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025663S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","articleId":"599945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599947,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Instead, cyclostationarity introduced at the receiver by fractional sampling is exploited. We show that simpler solutions are possible if cyclostationarity is introduced at the transmitter instead of the receiver. We propose specific coding and interleaving strategies at the transmitter that induce cyclostationarity and facilitate the equalization task. Novel batch and adaptive equalization algorithms are derived that make no assumptions on the channel zeros locations. Subspace methods are also proposed and, in the absence of noise, guarantee perfect estimation from finite data. Synchronization issues and bandwidth considerations are briefly discussed, and simulation examples are presented.","doi":"10.1109/78.599947","startPage":"1785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13197/00599947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599947","endPage":"1794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter induced cyclostationarity for blind channel equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter induced cyclostationarity for blind channel equalization","volume":"45","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5655839","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter induced cyclostationarity for blind channel equalization","sourcePdf":"00599947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060833S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"100","articleId":"599947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599949,"authors":[{"name":"J.J. van de Beek","affiliation":["Division of Signal Processing and the Centre for Distance-Spanning Technology, Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Lulea, Sweden"],"firstName":"J.J.","lastName":"van de Beek","id":"37533967000"},{"name":"M.

There has been interest in extending these ideas to the case of finite fields. We study the theory of PU filter banks (FBs) in GF(q) with q prime. Various properties of unitary and PU matrices in finite fields are studied. In particular, a number of factorization theorems are given. We show that (i) all unitary matrices in GF(q) are factorizable in terms of Householder-like matrices and permutation matrices, and (ii) the class of first-order PU matrices (the lapped orthogonal transform in finite fields) can always be expressed as a product of degree-one or degree-two building blocks. If q>2, we do not need degree-two building blocks. While many properties of PU matrices in finite fields are similar to those of PU matrices in complex field, there are a number of differences. For example, unlike the conventional PU systems, in finite fields, there are PU systems that are unfactorizable in terms of smaller building blocks. In fact, in the special case of 2/spl times/2 systems, all PU matrices that are factorizable in terms of degree-one building blocks are diagonal matrices. We derive results for both the cases of GF(2) and GF(Q) with q>2.

For this purpose, data-dependent sidelobe derivative constraints that do not require any a priori information about the jammer directions are used.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13197","startPage":"1878","endPage":"1885","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13197/00599965.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming algorithms with robustness against jammer motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming algorithms with robustness against jammer motion","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5655852","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming algorithms with robustness against jammer motion","sourcePdf":"00599965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029083S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"60","articleId":"599965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":599966,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

This implies that arbitrary small perturbation of the parameters of such a controller will cause asymptotic tracking to fail. Second, we propose a general 2-DOF controller architecture. We prove that in this structure, asymptotic tracking is, in general, fragile with respect to the controller parameters F/sub r/, F/sub y/ and C, while it is robust with respect to the plant parameters as well as the components H and L of the 2-DOF controller. Moreover, the only way to realize a 2-DOF controller in a nonfragile way is to generate the error signal exactly, which amounts to setting F/sub r/=F/sub y/=1. The results reconcile the requirements of the internal model principle, namely the necessity of error feedback, with the additional design freedom potentially offered by 2-DOF controllers. It specifies the controller architecture necessary for robustness and identifies the blocks whose parameters are available for tuning in the design process.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/13198/00599977.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.599977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.599977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tracking, error feedback, and two-degree-of-freedom controllers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Error correction","Automatic control","Steady-state","Lighting control","PD control","Proportional control","State feedback","Signal generators","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","tracking","asymptotic stability","transfer functions","feedback","closed loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking","error feedback","2-DOF controllers","asymptotic tracking","internal model principle","robustness","SISO systems","linear time invariant systems","transfer function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust tracking, error feedback, and two-degree-of-freedom controllers","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5646654","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tracking, error feedback, and two-degree-of-freedom controllers","sourcePdf":"00599977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027194S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"33","articleId":"599977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599990,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Besides, thermal noise, which is always present in the radar receiver, has been considered. The optimum detector is determined by thresholding an appropriate likelihood ratio test. To properly operate in an interference environment of unknown correlation, the optimum detector needs to adaptively estimate from the data the statistical properties of the interferences. Second-order spectral analysis is unable to separately estimate the correlation structure of K-distributed and Gaussian distributed clutter sources. Their separate estimation can be accomplished only in higher order spectrum domain. To reach this goal, an adaptive algorithm based on second- and higher order cumulants is proposed that removes these drawbacks and is able to operate in an environment of unknown correlation structure. The performance of the adaptive processing scheme has been evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13199/00599993.pdf","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1519","doi":"10.1109/78.599993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cumulant-based adaptive technique for coherent radar detection in a mixture of K-distributed clutter and Gaussian disturbance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A cumulant-based adaptive technique for coherent radar detection in a mixture of K-distributed clutter and Gaussian disturbance","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5613039","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cumulant-based adaptive technique for coherent radar detection in a mixture of K-distributed clutter and Gaussian disturbance","sourcePdf":"00599993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037727S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","articleId":"599993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-05"},{"_id":599996,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, such a problem is ill-posed and has no unique solution. Therefore, we can only find a solution of the problem within an equivalence class. We address the blind identification problem of the linear MIMO system driven by unobservable colored inputs using higher order statistics (HOS), particularly the fourth-order cumulants, of the outputs, where the unobservable inputs are mutually independent but temporally colored linear processes. We first define the set, which is denoted by S, of stable scalar transfer functions and then define the notion of a generalized permutation matrix (which is abbreviated by a g-matrix) over S. Then, it is shown that the transfer function matrix of an unknown system is identified only up to post-multiplication by a g matrix. This result is applied to identifying FIR systems for blind signal separation.","doi":"10.1109/78.599996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13199/00599996.pdf","startPage":"1543","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cumulant-based blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=599996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599996/","displayDocTitle":"Cumulant-based blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs","volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5613042","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cumulant-based blind identification of linear multi-input-multi-output systems driven by colored inputs","sourcePdf":"00599996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030469S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"57","articleId":"599996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":599998,"authors":[{"name":"Yifeng Zhou","affiliation":["Telexis Corporation, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yifeng Zhou","id":"37087264885"},{"name":"H.

We consider the registration problem, which is a prerequisite process of a data fusion system to accurately estimate and correct systematic errors. An exact maximum likelihood (EML) algorithm for registration is presented. The algorithm is implemented using a recursive two-step optimization that involves a modified Gauss-Newton procedure to ensure fast convergence. Statistical performance of the algorithm is also investigated, including its consistency and efficiency discussions. In particular, the explicit formulas for both the asymptotic covariance and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are derived. Finally, simulated and real-life multiple radar data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Least squares methods","Maximum likelihood estimation","Noise measurement","Newton method","Recursive estimation","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Coordinate measuring machines","Error correction","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion","maximum likelihood estimation","measurement errors","error correction","Newton method","convergence of numerical methods","covariance analysis","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact maximum likelihood registration algorithm","data fusion","association","correlation","multiple sources","registration problem","systematic error correction","systematic error estimation","recursive two-step optimization","modified Gauss-Newton procedure","fast convergence","statistical performance","efficiency","explicit formulas","asymptotic covariance","Cramer-Rao bound","multiple radar data","performance evaluation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.599998","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13199/00599998.pdf","doi":"10.1109/78.599998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exact maximum likelihood registration algorithm for data fusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"An exact maximum likelihood registration algorithm for data fusion","accessionNumber":"5613044","publicationDate":"June 1997","volume":"45","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/599998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact maximum likelihood registration algorithm for data fusion","sourcePdf":"00599998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032247S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"116","articleId":"599998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"}]
